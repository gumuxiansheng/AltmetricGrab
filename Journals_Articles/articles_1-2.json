(2017) examine whether a richer peer information environment reduces the cost of capital for firms with limited firm-specific information and whether this effect decreases as firm-specific information becomes more prevalent.

I argue that index funds fit the profile of nonstrategic traders who, according to theory, are unambiguously more likely than managers and strategic investors to prefer high stock liquidity and thus high disclosure. This suggests that I can use index funds' disclosure preferences to construct an empirical model of voluntary disclosure that abstracts away from managers' strategic disclosure motives.

Significant cross-sectional variation exists in SPACs' performance, which can be explained by the strong implicit incentives embedded in contracts.

to financial reporting and are the underlying innovation of accounting. Despite this, accounting research has provided little understanding of how economic forces affect a firm\u05f3s level of accruals and limited guidance for forming expectations of accruals based on ex ante firm characteristics. We consider accruals as a form of investment and examine whether theoretical predictions from a real options-based investment framework provide insight into the relation between accruals and the ex ante expected volatility faced by the firm. Specifically, the theory predicts that higher volatility dampens investment because firms prefer to \u2018wait and see\u2019 instead of investing immediately. Consistent with this theory, we document a robust negative relation between year-ahead net working capital accruals and expected volatility.

Despite this, accounting research has provided little understanding of how economic forces affect a firm\u05f3s level of accruals and limited guidance for forming expectations of accruals based on ex ante firm characteristics. We consider accruals as a form of investment and examine whether theoretical predictions from a real options-based investment framework provide insight into the relation between accruals and the ex ante expected volatility faced by the firm. Specifically, the theory predicts that higher volatility dampens investment because firms prefer to \u2018wait and see\u2019 instead of investing immediately. Consistent with this theory, we document a robust negative relation between year-ahead net working capital accruals and expected volatility. We also predict and find that the negative association between year-ahead net working capital accruals and expected volatility is less pronounced for distressed firms and more pronounced for firms with a longer operating cycle, and that current asset accruals are more sensitive to volatility than current liability accruals.

After Ambac\u05f3s bankruptcy, issuers of insured debt increase disclosure relative to issuers of uninsured debt. After local per capita income declines or expenditures increase, issuers, particularly those with strong electoral incentives and weak voter oversight, reduce disclosure. After the implementation of an online filing repository, issuers with few dissemination channels increase disclosure relative to other issuers.

Finally, while BPA in the pricing of one security does not cause BPA in the pricing of other securities, the price levels of those other securities will be affected if the securities with BPA are sufficiently large relative to the market as a whole.", "html_escaped_title": "Beliefs-driven price association", "id": "pub.1036342107", "issue": "2-3", "pages": "563-583", "pub_date": "2016-04", "pub_year": 2016, "volume": "61", "units_of_assessment": ["30017"], "sn_downloads_customer_1": 0, "times_cited": 1, "sn_denials_customer_1": 0, "sn_denials": 0, "sn_downloads": 0, "altmetric_id": 0, "score": 1.0, "affiliations_details": [{"first_name": "Paul E.", "last_name": "Fischer", "corresponding": "", "orcid": "", "current_organization_id": "grid.25879.31", "researcher_id": "ur.010744511231.61", "affiliations": [{"id": "grid.25879.31", "name": "University of Pennsylvania", "city": "Philadelphia", "city_id": 4560349, "country": "United States", "country_code": "US", "state": "Pennsylvania", "state_code": "US-PA"}], "raw_affiliation": ["The Wharton School, University of Pennsylvania, USA"]}, {"first_name": "Mirko S.", "last_name": "Heinle", "corresponding": true, "orcid": "", "current_organization_id": "grid.25879.31", "researcher_id": "ur.010070024150.34", "affiliations": [{"id": "grid.25879.31", "name": "University of Pennsylvania", "city": "Philadelphia", "city_id": 4560349, "country": "United States", "country_code": "US", "state": "Pennsylvania", "state_code": "US-PA"}], "raw_affiliation": ["The Wharton School, University of Pennsylvania, USA"]}, {"first_name": "Robert E.", "last_name": "Verrecchia", "corresponding": "", "orcid": "", "current_organization_id": "grid.25879.31", "researcher_id": "ur.012615011005.97", "affiliations": [{"id": "grid.25879.31", "name": "University of Pennsylvania", "city": "Philadelphia", "city_id": 4560349, "country": "United States", "country_code": "US", "state": "Pennsylvania", "state_code": "US-PA"}], "raw_affiliation": ["The Wharton School, University of Pennsylvania, USA"]}], "authors_full": ["Paul E.

These effects are consistent with capital gains taxes simultaneously reducing IPO proceeds and exacerbating IPO underpricing.", "html_escaped_title": "The effect of capital gains taxes on the initial pricing and underpricing of IPOs", "id": "pub.1004280967", "issue": "2-3", "pages": "465-485", "pub_date": "2016-04", "pub_year": 2016, "volume": "61", "units_of_assessment": ["30017"], "sn_downloads_customer_1": 0, "times_cited": 8, "sn_denials_customer_1": 0, "sn_denials": 0, "sn_downloads": 0, "altmetric_id": 0, "score": 1.0, "affiliations_details": [{"first_name": "Oliver Zhen", "last_name": "Li", "corresponding": true, "orcid": "", "current_organization_id": "grid.4280.e", "researcher_id": "ur.016015712107.66", "affiliations": [{"id": "grid.4280.e", "name": "National University of Singapore", "city": "Singapore", "city_id": 1880252, "country": "Singapore", "country_code": "SG", "state": null, "state_code": null}], "raw_affiliation": ["National University of Singapore, Singapore"]}, {"first_name": "Yupeng", "last_name": "Lin", "corresponding": "", "orcid": "['0000-0002-1025-3912']", "current_organization_id": "grid.4280.e", "researcher_id": "ur.016613272507.36", "affiliations": [{"id": "grid.35030.35", "name": "City University of Hong Kong", "city": "Hong Kong", "city_id": 1819729, "country": "China", "country_code": "CN", "state": null, "state_code": null}], "raw_affiliation": ["City University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong"]}, {"first_name": "John R.", "last_name": "Robinson", "corresponding": "", "orcid": "", "current_organization_id": "", "researcher_id": "", "affiliations": [{"id": "grid.264756.4", "name": "Texas A&M University", "city": "College Station", "city_id": 4682464, "country": "United States", "country_code": "US", "state": "Texas", "state_code": "US-TX"}], "raw_affiliation": ["Texas A&M University, USA"]}], "authors_full": ["Oliver Zhen Li", "Yupeng Lin", "John R.

Overall, our study contributes to the literature on tax avoidance by providing evidence that the internal information environment of the firm is important for understanding its tax avoidance outcomes.", "html_escaped_title": "The importance of the internal information environment for tax avoidance", "id": "pub.1035193349", "issue": "1", "pages": "149-167", "pub_date": "2015-08", "pub_year": 2015, "volume": "60", "units_of_assessment": ["30017"], "sn_downloads_customer_1": 0, "times_cited": 117, "sn_denials_customer_1": 0, "sn_denials": 0, "sn_downloads": 0, "altmetric_id": 0, "score": 1.0, "affiliations_details": [{"first_name": "John", "last_name": "Gallemore", "corresponding": "", "orcid": "['0000-0002-3393-4710']", "current_organization_id": "grid.170205.1", "researcher_id": "ur.07354153046.07", "affiliations": [{"id": "grid.170205.1", "name": "University of Chicago", "city": "Chicago", "city_id": 4887398, "country": "United States", "country_code": "US", "state": "Illinois", "state_code": "US-IL"}], "raw_affiliation": ["University of Chicago, USA"]}, {"first_name": "Eva", "last_name": "Labro", "corresponding": true, "orcid": "", "current_organization_id": "grid.10698.36", "researcher_id": "ur.013256765517.36", "affiliations": [{"id": "grid.410711.2", "name": "University of North Carolina System", "city": "Chapel Hill", "city_id": 4460162, "country": "United States", "country_code": "US", "state": "North Carolina", "state_code": "US-NC"}], "raw_affiliation": ["University of North Carolina, USA"]}], "authors_full": ["John Gallemore", "Eva Labro"], "source_title": "Journal of Accounting and Economics", "dimensions_badge": {"value": "pub.1035193349", "id_type": "id"}, "altmetric_badge": {"value": "10.1016/j.jacceco.2014.09.005", "id_type": "doi"}, "openurl": null, "orcid": null, "pub_class_id": "article", "navigation": {"path": "/details/publication/pub.1035193349"}}, {"title": "Market (in)attention and the strategic scheduling and timing of earnings announcements", "aff_org_name": ["University of California, Irvine", "Foster School of Business, University of Washington, USA", "Stanford University"], "affiliations_json": "[{\"first_name\": \"Ed\", \"last_name\": \"deHaan\", \"corresponding\": \"\", \"orcid\": \"\", \"current_organization_id\": \"grid.34477.33\", \"researcher_id\": \"ur.015673115026.37\", \"affiliations\": [{\"id\": \"grid.168010.e\", \"name\": \"Stanford University\", \"city\": \"Stanford\", \"city_id\": 5398563, \"country\": \"United States\", \"country_code\": \"US\", \"state\": \"California\", \"state_code\": \"US-CA\"}], \"raw_affiliation\": [\"Graduate School of Business, Stanford University, USA\"]}, {\"first_name\": \"Terry\", \"last_name\": \"Shevlin\", \"corresponding\": true, \"orcid\": \"['0000-0001-8286-2891']\", \"current_organization_id\": \"grid.266093.8\", \"researcher_id\": \"ur.015012300515.14\", \"affiliations\": [{\"id\": \"grid.266093.8\", \"name\": \"University of California, Irvine\", \"city\": \"Irvine\", \"city_id\": 5359777, \"country\": \"United States\", \"country_code\": \"US\", \"state\": \"California\", \"state_code\": \"US-CA\"}], \"raw_affiliation\": [\"Merage School of Business, University of California at Irvine, USA\"]}, {\"first_name\": \"Jacob\", \"last_name\": \"Thornock\", \"corresponding\": \"\", \"orcid\": \"['0000-0002-5608-6486']\", \"current_organization_id\": \"grid.253294.b\", \"researcher_id\": \"ur.016277526051.40\", \"affiliations\": [{\"name\": \"Foster School of Business, University of Washington, USA\"}], \"raw_affiliation\": [\"Foster School of Business, University of Washington, USA\"]}]", "author_list": "Ed deHaan, Terry Shevlin, Jacob Thornock", "researcher_dim_id": ["ur.015673115026.37", "ur.015012300515.14", "ur.016277526051.40"], "researcher_dim_count": 3, "for_first": ["2217"], "source_title_id": "jour.1138469", "journal_title": "Journal of Accounting and Economics", "for_v2": ["3292", "2214", "3326", "2215"], "language": "en", "open_access": false, "publisher_source": "Elsevier", "publisher_place": "230 Park Avenue Suite 800 Shantae McGee New York NY 10169-0935 United States", "publisher": "Elsevier", "pub_class": "Article", "cited_dimensions_ids": ["pub.1052422556", "pub.1070399807", "pub.1038999815", "pub.1015731530", "pub.1040076690", "pub.1028151147", "pub.1003274660", "pub.1006125823", "pub.1069940410", "pub.1063353016", "pub.1043010644", "pub.1090558423", "pub.1102261185", "pub.1002894401", "pub.1015712131", "pub.1029404517", "pub.1044822498", "pub.1048790613", "pub.1037325087", "pub.1042336666", "pub.1060005472", "pub.1042703418", "pub.1022229833", "pub.1005469470", "pub.1044915697", "pub.1012979465", "pub.1005821806", "pub.1014491993", "pub.1069940416", "pub.1024592053", "pub.1038417303", "pub.1051430645", "pub.1069941000"], "abstract": " We investigate whether managers \u201chide\u201d bad news by announcing earnings during periods of low attention, or by providing less forewarning of an upcoming earnings announcement.

We propose that RD risk can explain the accrual and investment anomalies.

We find that U.S. multinationals supply equity from headquarters to their foreign operating companies through foreign holding companies located in countries that lightly tax equity distributions. We also find that foreign holding companies tend to be located in countries with less corruption and investment risk than the countries in which the operating companies they own are located. In addition, we provide empirical evidence that the Netherlands, a well-known location for international tax planning, is a particularly popular site for foreign equity holding companies.

I conclude that the trend of decline in earnings quality is due more to changes in the sample of firms than to changes in generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) or in the earnings quality of previously listed firms.", "html_escaped_title": "Why have measures of earnings quality changed over time?", "id": "pub.1011328245", "issue": "2-3", "pages": "196-217", "pub_date": "2014-04", "pub_year": 2014, "volume": "57", "units_of_assessment": ["30017"], "sn_downloads_customer_1": 0, "times_cited": 79, "sn_denials_customer_1": 0, "sn_denials": 0, "sn_downloads": 0, "altmetric_id": 2335634, "altmetric": 25, "score": 1.0, "affiliations_details": [{"first_name": "Anup", "last_name": "Srivastava", "corresponding": true, "orcid": "", "current_organization_id": "", "researcher_id": "", "affiliations": [{"id": "grid.16753.36", "name": "Northwestern University", "city": "Evanston", "city_id": 4891382, "country": "United States", "country_code": "US", "state": "Illinois", "state_code": "US-IL"}], "raw_affiliation": ["Accounting Information and Management Department, Kellogg School of Management, Northwestern University, 6220 Jacobs Center, 2001 Sheridan Road, Evanston, IL 60208-2001, USA"]}], "authors_full": ["Anup Srivastava"], "source_title": "Journal of Accounting and Economics", "dimensions_badge": {"value": "pub.1011328245", "id_type": "id"}, "altmetric_badge": {"value": "10.1016/j.jacceco.2014.04.001", "id_type": "doi"}, "openurl": null, "orcid": null, "pub_class_id": "article", "navigation": {"path": "/details/publication/pub.1011328245"}}, {"title": "The role of bank monitoring in borrowers\u05f3 discretionary disclosure: Evidence from covenant violations", "aff_org_name": ["Duke University"], "affiliations_json": "[{\"first_name\": \"Rahul\", \"last_name\": \"Vashishtha\", \"corresponding\": true, \"orcid\": \"\", \"current_organization_id\": \"grid.26009.3d\", \"researcher_id\": \"ur.015634454275.99\", \"affiliations\": [{\"id\": \"grid.26009.3d\", \"name\": \"Duke University\", \"city\": \"Durham\", \"city_id\": 4464368, \"country\": \"United States\", \"country_code\": \"US\", \"state\": \"North Carolina\", \"state_code\": \"US-NC\"}], \"raw_affiliation\": [\"Duke University, 100 Fuqua Drive, Durham, NC 27708, United States\"]}]", "author_list": "Rahul Vashishtha", "researcher_dim_id": ["ur.015634454275.99"], "researcher_dim_count": 1, "for_first": ["2215"], "source_title_id": "jour.1138469", "journal_title": "Journal of Accounting and Economics", "for_v2": ["2215", "3335"], "language": "en", "open_access": false, "publisher_source": "Elsevier", "publisher_place": "230 Park Avenue Suite 800 Shantae McGee New York NY 10169-0935 United States", "publisher": "Elsevier", "pub_class": "Article", "cited_dimensions_ids": ["pub.1031128243", "pub.1011436229", "pub.1060006242", "pub.1000463049", "pub.1001566457", "pub.1033685009", "pub.1060006469", "pub.1037812510", "pub.1069868852", "pub.1045446097", "pub.1026587450", "pub.1058606157", "pub.1058671607", "pub.1025763434", "pub.1060005209", "pub.1050240063", "pub.1102821746", "pub.1013377447", "pub.1044110573", "pub.1043318423", "pub.1052423062", "pub.1025350344", "pub.1000113000", "pub.1060006143", "pub.1063349000", "pub.1069869200", "pub.1058572481", "pub.1019848753", "pub.1035451227", "pub.1038626281", "pub.1016806338", "pub.1003424354", "pub.1044031863", "pub.1047746252", "pub.1060006028", "pub.1018680446", "pub.1028125072", "pub.1038275603", "pub.1031041820", "pub.1015911399", "pub.1060006135", "pub.1033910884", "pub.1044302121", "pub.1032937945", "pub.1024693272", "pub.1069768947", "pub.1021204154", "pub.1045547252", "pub.1008700353", "pub.1021260223", "pub.1069768863", "pub.1017230000", "pub.1026670836", "pub.1044720038", "pub.1004848618", "pub.1025149248"], "abstract": "This study uses covenant violations to provide evidence on how firms make disclosure decisions in the presence of enhanced bank monitoring.

We exploit this regulatory change to isolate the shareholder value implications of CSR activities.

We find strong negative associations between social capital and corporate tax avoidance, as captured by effective tax rates and book-tax differences. These results are incremental to the effects of local religiosity and firm culture toward socially irresponsible activities.

We show that the effects of accounting disclosures on investment efficiency and investor welfare crucially depend on whether such disclosures convey information about the firm's future capital stock (i.e., balance sheet) or about its future operating cash flows (i.e., earnings). Specifically, investment efficiency and investor welfare unambiguously increase in the precision of disclosures that convey information about the future capital stock, since such disclosures mitigate the current owners' incentives to underinvest. In contrast, when accounting reports provide information about future cash flows, the firm can have incentives to either under- or overinvest depending on the precision of accounting reports and the expected growth in demand.

We show that the effects of accounting disclosures on investment efficiency and investor welfare crucially depend on whether such disclosures convey information about the firm&#x27;s future capital stock (i.e., balance sheet) or about its future operating cash flows (i.e., earnings). Specifically, investment efficiency and investor welfare unambiguously increase in the precision of disclosures that convey information about the future capital stock, since such disclosures mitigate the current owners&#x27; incentives to underinvest. In contrast, when accounting reports provide information about future cash flows, the firm can have incentives to either under- or overinvest depending on the precision of accounting reports and the expected growth in demand. For such disclosures, investment efficiency and investor welfare are maximized by an intermediate level of precision.

Consistent with this directive, prior research shows that investors find recognized values more pertinent than disclosed values. However, it remains unclear whether reporting items are recognized because they are more relevant for investing decisions, or whether requiring recognition itself prompts differing behavior on the part of firms and investors. Using the setting of subsequent events, I identify the differential effect of requiring disclosure versus recognition in a setting where the accounting treatment of an item is exogenously determined.

In an experiment where audit managers acted as consultants to other auditors, we examine conditions in which consultants either recommend estimates that differ substantially from advice-seekers\u2019 assessments (contrariness) or recommend narrower reasonable ranges of estimates (precision). Psychology theory argues that both of these attributes can improve estimates. We examine whether these attributes depend on consultants' status motives, that is, the desire to gain respect from or power over others. We find that active status motives lead consultants with higher specialized knowledge to provide recommendations that are less contrary, but more precise.

In an experiment where audit managers acted as consultants to other auditors, we examine conditions in which consultants either recommend estimates that differ substantially from advice-seekers\u2019 assessments (contrariness) or recommend narrower reasonable ranges of estimates (precision). Psychology theory argues that both of these attributes can improve estimates. We examine whether these attributes depend on consultants&#x27; status motives, that is, the desire to gain respect from or power over others. We find that active status motives lead consultants with higher specialized knowledge to provide recommendations that are less contrary, but more precise.

Thus, measuring credit risk cannot fully explain the choice of accounting performance measures in earnings-based covenants. I conjecture that contracting parties choose an EBITDA-related measure, instead of a measure calculated after depreciation and amortization expenses (e.g., EBIT), to make the performance measure less sensitive to investment activities, which can be controlled through other contractual terms, such as a restriction on capital expenditure, and provide empirical evidence consistent with this conjecture.", "acknowledgements": "", "aff_city_geonames_ids": ["4722625"], "aff_city_name": ["Richardson"], "aff_country_codes": ["US"], "aff_country_count": 1, "aff_country_name": ["United States"], "aff_org_count": 1, "aff_org_id": ["grid.267323.1"], "aff_current_org_ids": ["grid.267323.1"], "aff_org_types": ["Education"], "aff_state_codes": ["US-TX"], "aff_state_name": ["Texas"], "created_in_dimensions": "2017-08-31T12:50:56Z", "doi": "10.1111/1475-679x.12125", "html_escaped_abstract": "This paper examines how performance measures are defined in major earnings-based financial covenants in loan contracts to shed light on the economic rationales underlying the contractual use of performance measures.

I conjecture that contracting parties choose an EBITDA-related measure, instead of a measure calculated after depreciation and amortization expenses (e.g., EBIT), to make the performance measure less sensitive to investment activities, which can be controlled through other contractual terms, such as a restriction on capital expenditure, and provide empirical evidence consistent with this conjecture.", "html_escaped_title": "Performance Measures in Earnings\u2010Based Financial Covenants in Debt Contracts", "id": "pub.1023100103", "issue": "4", "pages": "1149-1186", "pub_date": "2016-09", "pub_year": 2016, "volume": "54", "units_of_assessment": ["30017"], "sn_downloads_customer_1": 0, "times_cited": 33, "sn_denials_customer_1": 0, "sn_denials": 0, "sn_downloads": 0, "altmetric_id": 0, "score": 1.0, "affiliations_details": [{"first_name": "NINGZHONG", "last_name": "LI", "corresponding": "", "orcid": "", "current_organization_id": "grid.267323.1", "researcher_id": "ur.013562106135.67", "affiliations": [{"id": "grid.267323.1", "name": "The University of Texas at Dallas", "city": "Richardson", "city_id": 4722625, "country": "United States", "country_code": "US", "state": "Texas", "state_code": "US-TX"}], "raw_affiliation": ["University of Texas at Dallas"]}], "authors_full": ["NINGZHONG LI"], "source_title": "Journal of Accounting Research", "dimensions_badge": {"value": "pub.1023100103", "id_type": "id"}, "altmetric_badge": {"value": "10.1111/1475-679x.12125", "id_type": "doi"}, "openurl": null, "orcid": null, "pub_class_id": "article", "navigation": {"path": "/details/publication/pub.1023100103"}}, {"title": "Fair Value Accounting and Debt Contracting: Evidence from Adoption of SFAS 159", "aff_org_name": ["University of Notre Dame", "University of Washington Foster School of Business", "University of Houston"], "affiliations_json": "[{\"first_name\": \"PETER R.\", \"last_name\": \"DEMERJIAN\", \"corresponding\": \"\", \"orcid\": \"['0000-0001-9973-2276']\", \"current_organization_id\": \"grid.185648.6\", \"researcher_id\": \"ur.013665241553.16\", \"affiliations\": [{\"name\": \"University of Washington Foster School of Business\"}], \"raw_affiliation\": [\"University of Washington Foster School of Business\"]}, {\"first_name\": \"JOHN\", \"last_name\": \"DONOVAN\", \"corresponding\": \"\", \"orcid\": \"['0000-0002-8509-440X']\", \"current_organization_id\": \"grid.131063.6\", \"researcher_id\": \"ur.010222512314.65\", \"affiliations\": [{\"id\": \"grid.131063.6\", \"name\": \"University of Notre Dame\", \"city\": \"Notre Dame\", \"city_id\": 8469294, \"country\": \"United States\", \"country_code\": \"US\", \"state\": \"Indiana\", \"state_code\": \"US-IN\"}], \"raw_affiliation\": [\"University of Notre Dame Mendoza College of Business\"]}, {\"first_name\": \"CHAD R.\", \"last_name\": \"LARSON\", \"corresponding\": \"\", \"orcid\": \"['0000-0002-1973-726X']\", \"current_organization_id\": \"grid.266436.3\", \"researcher_id\": \"ur.010107005042.41\", \"affiliations\": [{\"id\": \"grid.266436.3\", \"name\": \"University of Houston\", \"city\": \"Houston\", \"city_id\": 4699066, \"country\": \"United States\", \"country_code\": \"US\", \"state\": \"Texas\", \"state_code\": \"US-TX\"}], \"raw_affiliation\": [\"University of Houston Bauer College of Business\"]}]", "author_list": "PETER R.

My findings imply that incremental information risks result in a different optimal contract in international debt contracts compared to domestic debt contracts.", "html_escaped_title": "Institutional Differences and International Private Debt Markets: A Test Using Mandatory IFRS Adoption", "id": "pub.1035502263", "issue": "3", "pages": "679-723", "pub_date": "2016-06", "pub_year": 2016, "volume": "54", "units_of_assessment": ["30017"], "sn_downloads_customer_1": 0, "times_cited": 10, "sn_denials_customer_1": 0, "sn_denials": 0, "sn_downloads": 0, "altmetric_id": 0, "score": 1.0, "affiliations_details": [{"first_name": "ANNA BERGMAN", "last_name": "BROWN", "corresponding": "", "orcid": "", "current_organization_id": "", "researcher_id": "", "affiliations": [{"id": "grid.53857.3c", "name": "Utah State University", "city": "Logan", "city_id": 5777544, "country": "United States", "country_code": "US", "state": "Utah", "state_code": "US-UT"}], "raw_affiliation": ["Utah State University Jon M.

Further, we find that higher competition is associated with higher stand-alone risk of individual banks, greater sensitivity of a bank&#x27;s downside equity risk to system-wide distress, and a greater contribution by individual banks to downside risk of the banking sector.", "html_escaped_title": "Bank Competition: Measurement, Decision\u2010Making, and Risk\u2010Taking", "id": "pub.1013665485", "issue": "3", "pages": "777-826", "pub_date": "2016-06", "pub_year": 2016, "volume": "54", "units_of_assessment": ["30017"], "sn_downloads_customer_1": 0, "times_cited": 24, "sn_denials_customer_1": 0, "sn_denials": 0, "sn_downloads": 0, "altmetric_id": 0, "score": 1.0, "affiliations_details": [{"first_name": "ROBERT M.", "last_name": "BUSHMAN", "corresponding": "", "orcid": "", "current_organization_id": "grid.10698.36", "researcher_id": "ur.010653346713.53", "affiliations": [{"name": "University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill Kenan\u2010Flagler Business School"}], "raw_affiliation": ["University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill Kenan\u2010Flagler Business School"]}, {"first_name": "BRADLEY E.", "last_name": "HENDRICKS", "corresponding": "", "orcid": "", "current_organization_id": "", "researcher_id": "ur.013302005557.12", "affiliations": [{"name": "University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill Kenan\u2010Flagler Business School"}], "raw_affiliation": ["University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill Kenan\u2010Flagler Business School"]}, {"first_name": "CHRISTOPHER D.", "last_name": "WILLIAMS", "corresponding": "", "orcid": "", "current_organization_id": "grid.214458.e", "researcher_id": "ur.013435427207.61", "affiliations": [{"id": "grid.214458.e", "name": "University of Michigan\u2013Ann Arbor", "city": "Ann Arbor", "city_id": 4984247, "country": "United States", "country_code": "US", "state": "Michigan", "state_code": "US-MI"}], "raw_affiliation": ["University of Michigan Ross School of Business"]}], "authors_full": ["ROBERT M.

disclosure and financial reporting regulation, drawing on U.S. and international evidence. Given the policy relevance of research on regulation, we highlight the challenges with (1) quantifying regulatory costs and benefits, (2) measuring disclosure and reporting outcomes, and (3) drawing causal inferences from regulatory studies. Next, we discuss empirical studies that link disclosure and reporting activities to firm-specific and market-wide economic outcomes. Understanding these links is important when evaluating regulation. We then synthesize the empirical evidence on the economic effects of disclosure regulation and reporting standards, including the evidence on International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) adoption. Several important conclusions emerge. We generally lack evidence on market-wide effects and externalities from regulation, yet such evidence is central to the economic justification of regulation. Moreover, evidence on causal effects of disclosure and reporting regulation is still relatively rare. We also lack evidence on the real effects of such regulation. These limitations provide many research opportunities. We conclude with several specific suggestions for future research.", "acknowledgements": "", "aff_city_geonames_ids": ["4887398", "4151871"], "aff_city_name": ["Chicago", "Coral Gables"], "aff_country_codes": ["US"], "aff_country_count": 1, "aff_country_name": ["United States"], "aff_org_count": 1, "aff_org_id": ["grid.26790.3a"], "aff_current_org_ids": ["grid.170205.1"], "aff_org_types": ["Education"], "aff_state_codes": ["US-FL"], "aff_state_name": ["Florida"], "created_in_dimensions": "2017-08-31T12:50:56Z", "doi": "10.1111/1475-679x.12115", "html_escaped_abstract": "This paper discusses the empirical literature on the economic consequences of disclosure and financial reporting regulation, drawing on U.S. and international evidence.

offering (IPO) price formation from the initial price range to the offer price to the closing price on the first trading day. For a post-bubble sample of 2001\u20132013 IPOs, we find that pre-IPO net income and, in particular, operating cash flow are strongly, positively associated with the revision from the mid-point of the initial price range to the offer price and that the \u201cpartial adjustment phenomenon\u201d concentrates among issuers with the strongest operating performance. As for why publicly observable information helps predict changes in valuation from when the initial price range is set to when the offer price is set, our findings suggest that strong-performing issuers, especially those offering small slices of ownership, have lower bargaining incentives and are susceptible to the underwriter(s) low-balling the price range.

Taken together, our findings suggest that insiders\u2019 ability to learn from outsiders improves post-IFRS, and this improved ability to learn from outsiders leads to real economic gains.", "html_escaped_title": "Do Improvements in the Information Environment Enhance Insiders\u2019 Ability to Learn from Outsiders?", "id": "pub.1030688209", "issue": "4", "pages": "863-905", "pub_date": "2015-09", "pub_year": 2015, "volume": "53", "units_of_assessment": ["30017"], "sn_downloads_customer_1": 0, "times_cited": 13, "sn_denials_customer_1": 0, "sn_denials": 0, "sn_downloads": 0, "altmetric_id": 0, "score": 1.0, "affiliations_details": [{"first_name": "GILBERTO", "last_name": "LOUREIRO", "corresponding": "", "orcid": "['0000-0002-2831-5034']", "current_organization_id": "grid.10328.38", "researcher_id": "ur.015214115577.46", "affiliations": [{"id": "grid.10328.38", "name": "University of Minho", "city": "Braga", "city_id": 2742032, "country": "Portugal", "country_code": "PT", "state": null, "state_code": null}], "raw_affiliation": ["University of Minho"]}, {"first_name": "ALVARO G.", "last_name": "TABOADA", "corresponding": "", "orcid": "", "current_organization_id": "grid.260120.7", "researcher_id": "ur.07601342161.40", "affiliations": [{"id": "grid.267305.5", "name": "University of Tennessee System", "city": "Knoxville", "city_id": 4634946, "country": "United States", "country_code": "US", "state": "Tennessee", "state_code": "US-TN"}], "raw_affiliation": ["University of Tennessee"]}], "authors_full": ["GILBERTO LOUREIRO", "ALVARO G.

We first provide evidence that corporate tax revenues are less volatile in high accrual countries, but high accrual countries collect relatively higher (lower) tax revenues when the corporate sector grows (contracts). Critically, we then show that accruals and smoother tax revenues are favored by countries with higher levels of government spending on public services and uncertain future expenditures, while countries with procyclical other tax collections favor cash rules and lower procyclicality of corporate tax revenues.", "html_escaped_title": "Why Do Countries Mandate Accrual Accounting for Tax Purposes?", "id": "pub.1013604834", "issue": "5", "pages": "1127-1163", "pub_date": "2014-12", "pub_year": 2014, "volume": "52", "units_of_assessment": ["30017"], "sn_downloads_customer_1": 0, "times_cited": 8, "sn_denials_customer_1": 0, "sn_denials": 0, "sn_downloads": 0, "altmetric_id": 0, "score": 1.0, "affiliations_details": [{"first_name": "IGOR", "last_name": "GONCHAROV", "corresponding": "", "orcid": "['0000-0002-4528-1681']", "current_organization_id": "grid.9835.7", "researcher_id": "ur.016130062627.15", "affiliations": [{"id": "grid.9835.7", "name": "Lancaster University", "city": "Lancaster", "city_id": 2644972, "country": "United Kingdom", "country_code": "GB", "state": null, "state_code": null}], "raw_affiliation": ["Lancaster University Management School;"]}, {"first_name": "MARTIN", "last_name": "JACOB", "corresponding": "", "orcid": "", "current_organization_id": "", "researcher_id": "", "affiliations": [{"name": "WHU \u2013 Otto Beisheim School of Management"}], "raw_affiliation": ["WHU \u2013 Otto Beisheim School of Management"]}], "authors_full": ["IGOR GONCHAROV", "MARTIN JACOB"], "source_title": "Journal of Accounting Research", "dimensions_badge": {"value": "pub.1013604834", "id_type": "id"}, "altmetric_badge": {"value": "10.1111/1475-679x.12061", "id_type": "doi"}, "openurl": null, "orcid": null, "pub_class_id": "article", "navigation": {"path": "/details/publication/pub.1013604834"}}, {"title": "The Effects of Uncertainty and Disclosure on Auditors&#x27; Fair Value Materiality Decisions", "aff_org_name": ["University of Notre Dame"], "affiliations_json": "[{\"first_name\": \"JEREMY B.\", \"last_name\": \"GRIFFIN\", \"corresponding\": \"\", \"orcid\": \"\", \"current_organization_id\": \"\", \"researcher_id\": \"\", \"affiliations\": [{\"id\": \"grid.131063.6\", \"name\": \"University of Notre Dame\", \"city\": \"Notre Dame\", \"city_id\": 8469294, \"country\": \"United States\", \"country_code\": \"US\", \"state\": \"Indiana\", \"state_code\": \"US-IN\"}], \"raw_affiliation\": [\"University of Notre Dame Mendoza College of Business\"]}]", "author_list": "JEREMY B.

These results have implications for academics interested in how earnings management, and perhaps fraud, can accrete over time and for regulators and practitioners who are interested in preventing it.", "html_escaped_title": "Advantageous Comparison and Rationalization of Earnings Management", "id": "pub.1011814174", "issue": "4", "pages": "849-876", "pub_date": "2014-09", "pub_year": 2014, "volume": "52", "units_of_assessment": ["30017"], "sn_downloads_customer_1": 0, "times_cited": 14, "sn_denials_customer_1": 0, "sn_denials": 0, "sn_downloads": 0, "altmetric_id": 2190480, "altmetric": 1, "score": 1.0, "affiliations_details": [{"first_name": "TIMOTHY J.", "last_name": "BROWN", "corresponding": "", "orcid": "", "current_organization_id": "", "researcher_id": "", "affiliations": [{"id": "grid.35403.31", "name": "University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign", "city": "Urbana", "city_id": 4914570, "country": "United States", "country_code": "US", "state": "Illinois", "state_code": "US-IL"}], "raw_affiliation": ["The University of Illinois at Urbana\u2010Champaign"]}], "authors_full": ["TIMOTHY J.

We identify conditions under which public information increases or decreases price informativeness, and when multiple equilibria may arise. Our analysis shows that public information not only directly endows prices with more (public) information, it can also have an important indirect effect on the degree to which prices reveal private information.", "acknowledgements": "", "aff_city_geonames_ids": ["4464368", "4140963"], "aff_city_name": ["Durham", "Washington, D.C."], "aff_country_codes": ["US"], "aff_country_count": 1, "aff_country_name": ["United States"], "aff_org_count": 1, "aff_org_id": ["grid.26009.3d"], "aff_org_types": ["Education"], "aff_state_codes": ["US-NC"], "aff_state_name": ["North Carolina"], "created_in_dimensions": "2017-08-31T12:50:56Z", "doi": "10.1111/1475-679x.12052", "html_escaped_abstract": "This paper analyzes the effects of public information in a perfect competition trading model populated by asymmetrically informed short-horizon investors with different levels of private information precision.

However, while language sentiment and readability co-occur in practice, their joint effects remain largely unexplored. In an experiment with MBA students as participants, we investigate how the effect of language sentiment varies with readability and investor sophistication level.

More sophisticated investors and experienced analysts are found to have a better understanding of the benefits of consistent management forecasts.", "html_escaped_title": "Management Forecast Consistency", "id": "pub.1042034367", "issue": "1", "pages": "163-191", "pub_date": "2014-03", "pub_year": 2014, "volume": "52", "units_of_assessment": ["30017"], "sn_downloads_customer_1": 0, "times_cited": 17, "sn_denials_customer_1": 0, "sn_denials": 0, "sn_downloads": 0, "altmetric_id": 0, "score": 1.0, "affiliations_details": [{"first_name": "GILLES", "last_name": "HILARY", "corresponding": "", "orcid": "", "current_organization_id": "grid.469459.3", "researcher_id": "ur.013546757455.07", "affiliations": [{"id": "grid.424837.e", "name": "INSEAD", "city": "Fontainebleau", "city_id": 3018074, "country": "France", "country_code": "FR", "state": null, "state_code": null}], "raw_affiliation": ["INSEAD"]}, {"first_name": "CHARLES", "last_name": "HSU", "corresponding": "", "orcid": "['0000-0002-4476-864X']", "current_organization_id": "grid.24515.37", "researcher_id": "ur.015312224705.82", "affiliations": [{"id": "grid.24515.37", "name": "Hong Kong University of Science and Technology", "city": "Hong Kong", "city_id": 1819729, "country": "China", "country_code": "CN", "state": null, "state_code": null}], "raw_affiliation": ["Hong Kong University of Science and Technology"]}, {"first_name": "RENCHENG", "last_name": "WANG", "corresponding": "", "orcid": "", "current_organization_id": "grid.1008.9", "researcher_id": "ur.011541303115.27", "affiliations": [{"id": "grid.1003.2", "name": "University of Queensland", "city": "Brisbane", "city_id": 2174003, "country": "Australia", "country_code": "AU", "state": "Queensland", "state_code": "AU-QLD"}], "raw_affiliation": ["University of Queensland"]}], "authors_full": ["GILLES HILARY", "CHARLES HSU", "RENCHENG WANG"], "source_title": "Journal of Accounting Research", "dimensions_badge": {"value": "pub.1042034367", "id_type": "id"}, "altmetric_badge": {"value": "10.1111/1475-679x.12033", "id_type": "doi"}, "openurl": null, "orcid": null, "pub_class_id": "article", "navigation": {"path": "/details/publication/pub.1042034367"}}, {"title": "Private Interaction Between Firm Management and Sell\u2010Side Analysts", "aff_org_name": ["Harvard University"], "affiliations_json": "[{\"first_name\": \"EUGENE\", \"last_name\": \"SOLTES\", \"corresponding\": \"\", \"orcid\": \"\", \"current_organization_id\": \"grid.38142.3c\", \"researcher_id\": \"ur.07535417413.69\", \"affiliations\": [{\"id\": \"grid.38142.3c\", \"name\": \"Harvard University\", \"city\": \"Cambridge\", \"city_id\": 4931972, \"country\": \"United States\", \"country_code\": \"US\", \"state\": \"Massachusetts\", \"state_code\": \"US-MA\"}], \"raw_affiliation\": [\"Harvard Business School\"]}]", "author_list": "EUGENE SOLTES", "researcher_dim_id": ["ur.07535417413.69"], "researcher_dim_count": 1, "for_first": ["2215"], "source_title_id": "jour.1137699", "journal_title": "Journal of Accounting Research", "for_v2": ["3342", "2215"], "language": "en", "linkout_oa": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/1475-679X.12037", "open_access": true, "publisher_source": "Wiley", "publisher_place": "111 River Street Hoboken NJ 07030 United States", "publisher": "Wiley", "pub_class": "Article", "cited_dimensions_ids": ["pub.1013331056", "pub.1102354165", "pub.1102327211", "pub.1102317516", "pub.1050245252", "pub.1102318245", "pub.1039973286", "pub.1050805216", "pub.1038124524", "pub.1064524904", "pub.1021779753", "pub.1049656888", "pub.1052950094", "pub.1102372570", "pub.1049309620", "pub.1102321263", "pub.1058865427", "pub.1026540125", "pub.1073452464", "pub.1102354582", "pub.1102354412", "pub.1102344235", "pub.1048388808", "pub.1052843341", "pub.1073465073", "pub.1069941060", "pub.1041589069", "pub.1018627802", "pub.1102317416"], "abstract": "Although sell-side analysts often privately interact with managers of publicly traded firms, the private nature of this contact has historically obscured direction examination.
