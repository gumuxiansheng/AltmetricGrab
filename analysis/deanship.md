The proposed research falls directly under the areas of Information Technology & Digitization, and the expected outcomes would improve the work in Research Analytics and Decision Support Unit. The research objectives are highly related to the Science of Sciences, the literature cited are all relevant.

It's not quite new to evaluate by citations and other info besides the number of publications, but this project also focus on the gap between research and the country's vision. The variety of methods can enrich the research. It may be the first one to illustrate the gap between Saudi universities' researches and the Saudi Vision 2030.

## Objectives
The project objectives are specific, measurable, attainable and relevant

The objectives are very clear in proposal. However, it's not so clear how we can measure all these objectives. The project focus on Saudi universities and the Saudi government strategic plans, should be quite different from other researches around the world.

## Literature Review
Includes pertinent, up-to-date background information and identifies clearly gaps in knowledge that the proposed project will address

<font color='red'>*\* Required*</font>


Kindly justify your above scores:
<font color='red'>*\* Required*</font>

The literatures listed are highly related and up-to-date, but it may be better if we could see the comparison of these literatures and this project. In the proposal we can only justify there is no research project was conducted on Science of Science research topic in the investigators’ knowledge.

## Methodology
States methods to be used in data collection, analysis and interpretation

Kindly justify your above scores:
<font color='red'>*\* Required*</font>

The tasks are very clear in each step, but we did't see if there's other methods and why we choose this method.

## Management Plan
Clearly identifies and outlines the role of team members and consultants (if any)

Only four people in the project might be a little short for all the tasks, so 18 months may be a reasonable estimate.

## Overall Evaluation
- [ ] Excellent Proposal - Highly Recommended
- [x] A Very Good Proposal with Minor Revisions Suggested
- [ ] Not Recommended

Kindly justify your overall evaluation:

It's not quite new around the world to evaluate institues and individuals by citations and other info, but the project focus on Saudi and try to investigate the gap between research and the Saudi Vision 2030, the expected outputs should be very helpful to universities and the government. The proposal is practicable and achievable. Located in Saudi Arabia, the small research team with a senior consultant majoring in the areas of Information Technology & Digitization is competent and reliable.

It would be better to elaborate the methods and show how the indicators will be build.
