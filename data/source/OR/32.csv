AB We consider the problem of scheduling a set of jobs on a single machine subject to inventory constraints, i.e., conditions that jobs add or remove items to or from a centralized inventory, respectively. Jobs that remove items cannot be processed if the required number of items is not available. We focus on scheduling problems on a single machine where the objective is to minimize the total weighted completion time. In this paper, we design 2-approximation algorithms for special cases of the problem that run in polynomial time.

AB The Joint Replenishment Problem () is a fundamental optimization problem in supply-chain management, concerned with optimizing the flow of goods from a supplier to retailers. Over time, in response to demands at the retailers, the supplier ships orders, via a warehouse, to the retailers. The objective is to schedule these orders to minimize the sum of ordering costs and retailers' waiting costs. We study the approximability of , the version of with deadlines, where instead of waiting costs the retailers impose strict deadlines. We study the integrality gap of the standard linear-program (LP) relaxation, giving a lower bound of , a stronger, computer-assisted lower bound of , as well as an upper bound and approximation ratio of . The best previous upper bound and approximation ratio was ; no lower bound was previously published. For the special case when all demand periods are of equal length, we give an upper bound of , a lower bound of , and show APX-hardness.

TI Real-time scheduling to minimize machine busy times

DE Real-time scheduling; Power-aware; Minimum total busy time;
   Approximation algorithms
ID ALLOCATION
AB Consider the following scheduling problem. We are given a set of jobs, each having a release time, a due date, a processing time, and demand for machine capacity. The goal is to schedule all jobs non-preemptively in their release-time deadline windows on machines that can process multiple jobs simultaneously, subject to machine capacity constraints, with the objective to minimize the total busy time of the machines. Our problem naturally arises in power-aware scheduling, optical network design, and customer service systems, among others. The problem is APX-hard by a simple reduction from the subset sum problem. A main result of this paper is a 5-approximation algorithm for general instances. While the algorithm is simple, its analysis involves a non-trivial charging scheme which bounds the total busy time in terms of work and span lower bounds on the optimum. This improves and extends the results of Flammini et al. (Theor Comput Sci 411(40-42):3553-3562, 2010). We extend this approximation to the case of moldable jobs, where the algorithm also needs to choose, for each job, one of several processing-time versus demand configurations. Better bounds and exact algorithms are derived for several special cases, including proper interval graphs, intervals forming a clique and laminar families of intervals.

AB In this paper, we study a robust single-machine scheduling problem under four alternative optimization criteria: minimizing total completion time, minimizing total weighted completion time, minimizing maximum lateness, and minimizing the number of late jobs. We assume that job processing times are subject to uncertainty. Accordingly, we construct three alternative uncertainty sets, each of which defines job processing times that can simultaneously occur. The robust optimization framework assumes that, given a job schedule, a worst-case set of processing times will be realized from among those allowed by the uncertainty set under consideration. For each combination of objective function and uncertainty set, we first analyze the problem of identifying a set of worst-case processing times with respect to a fixed schedule, and then investigate the problem of selecting a schedule whose worst-case objective is minimal.

AB Many supply chains use returnable packaging such as plastic and metal containers, folding boxes, racks, and trays to transport components from suppliers to buyers. This study investigates the scheduling problem of a supplier that produces jobs for several buyers where the jobs for each buyer have to be delivered in that buyer's returnable containers. Empty containers are provided by the buyers at certain release dates. The supplier can process a job when no adequate empty containers are available, but then incurs extra handling costs to pack the job into auxiliary packaging and repack it later. This study extends single machine scheduling with weighted earliness and tardiness penalties and batching by including returnable containers and repacking penalties. A mathematical programming formulation and a two-stage heuristic for this previously unstudied NP-hard scheduling problem are proposed and evaluated in a numerical study.

AB The resource-constrained project scheduling problem with minimum and maximum time lags (RCPSP/max) is a general model for resource scheduling in many real-world problems (such as manufacturing and construction engineering). We consider RCPSP/max problems where the durations of activities are stochastic and resources can have unforeseen breakdowns. Given a level of allowable risk, , our mechanisms aim to compute the minimum robust makespan execution strategy. Robust makespan for an execution strategy is any makespan value that has a risk less than . The risk for a makespan value, given an execution strategy, is the probability that a schedule instantiated from the execution strategy will not finish before given the uncertainty over durations and resources. We make three key contributions: (a) firstly, we provide an analytical evaluation of resource breakdowns and repairs on executions of activities; (b) we then incorporate such information into a local search framework and generate execution strategies that can absorb resource and durational uncertainties; and (c) finally, to improve robustness of resulting strategies, we propose resource breakdown aware chaining procedure with three different metrics. This chaining procedure computes resource allocations by predicting the effect of breakdowns on robustness of generated strategies. Experiments show effectiveness of our proposed methods in providing more robust execution strategies under uncertainty.

The jobs are to be assigned online to one of the machines and the objective is to minimize the makespan. The best known algorithm for this problem achieves a competitive ratio 1.6 (Cheng et al. in Theor Comput Sci 337:134-146, 2005). The best known lower bound is approximately 1.585 (Albers and Hellwig in Theor Comput Sci 443:1-9, 2012) if the number of machines tends to infinity. We present an elementary algorithm with competitive ratio equal to this lower bound. Thus, the algorithm is best possible if the number of machines tends to infinity.

AB Coupled tasks are two-operation tasks, where the two operations are separated by a time interval of fixed duration. Coupled task scheduling problems refer then to the scheduling of a set of coupled tasks on a single machine. Applications of these problems, reported in the literature, arise in connection with radar systems, robotic cells, and in manufacturing. Most of the complexity issues for scheduling coupled tasks have been settled. However, the complexity status has been unknown for the identical coupled task problem, where multiple copies of a single coupled task are to be processed. The purpose of the article is to solve this open problem in the cyclic case, for which we prove the polynomial complexity.

DE Aircraft sequencing problem; MILP; Rolling horizon algorithms
ID LONDON-HEATHROW-AIRPORT; LANDINGS; ALGORITHMS
AB In a scenario characterized by a continuous growth of air transportation demand, the runways of large airports serve hundreds of aircraft every day. Aircraft sequencing is a challenging problem that aims to increase runway capacity in order to reduce delays as well as the workload of air traffic controllers. In many cases, the air traffic controllers solve the problem using the simple "first-come-first-serve" (FCFS) rule. In this paper, we present a rolling horizon approach which partitions a sequence of aircraft into chunks and solves the aircraft sequencing problem (ASP) individually for each of these chunks. Some rules for deciding how to partition a given aircraft sequence are proposed and their effects on solution quality investigated. Moreover, two mixed integer linear programming models for the ASP are reviewed in order to formalize the problem, and a tabu search heuristic is proposed for finding solutions to the ASP in a short computation time. Finally, we develop an IRHA which, using different chunking rules, is able to find solutions significantly improving on the FCFS rule for real-world air traffic instances from Milano Linate Airport.

AB Numerous applications in scheduling, such as resource allocation or steel manufacturing, can be modeled using the NP-hard Independent Set problem (given an undirected graph and an integer , find a set of at least pairwise non-adjacent vertices). Here, one encounters special graph classes like 2-union graphs (edge-wise unions of two interval graphs) and strip graphs (edge-wise unions of an interval graph and a cluster graph), on which Independent Set remains -hard but admits constant ratio approximations in polynomial time. We study the parameterized complexity of Independent Set on 2-union graphs and on subclasses like strip graphs. Our investigations significantly benefit from a new structural "compactness" parameter of interval graphs and novel problem formulations using vertex-colored interval graphs. Our main contributions are as follows:
   1. We show a complexity dichotomy: restricted to graph classes closed under induced subgraphs and disjoint unions, Independent Set is polynomial-time solvable if both input interval graphs are cluster graphs, and is -hard otherwise.
   2. We chart the possibilities and limits of effective polynomial-time preprocessing (also known as kernelization).
   3. We extend Halldrsson and Karlsson (2006)'s fixed-parameter algorithm for Independent Set on strip graphs parameterized by the structural parameter "maximum number of live jobs" to show that the problem (also known as Job Interval Selection) is fixed-parameter tractable with respect to the parameter and generalize their algorithm from strip graphs to 2-union graphs. Preliminary experiments with random data indicate that Job Interval Selection with up to 15 jobs and intervals can be solved optimally in less than 5 min.

AB We address a novel integrated maintenance and production scheduling problem in a multi-machine and multi-period production system, considering maintenance as a long-term decision. Deterioration of machines over time decreases production capacity. Since maintenance activities not only improve machine conditions, increasing production capacity, but also take time that cannot be used for production, the challenge is to assign maintenance to periods and to schedule maintenance and production activities within each period to minimize the combined cost of maintenance and lost production over the planning horizon. Motivated by logic-based Benders decomposition, we design an integrated two-stage algorithm to solve the problem. The first stage assigns maintenance to machines and time periods, abstracting the scheduling problem, while the second stage creates a schedule for the current time period. The first stage is then re-solved using feedback from the schedule. This iteration between maintenance planning and scheduling continues until the solution costs in two stages converge. The integrated approach models the interdependencies between maintenance and scheduling decisions in highly coupled processes such as wafer fabrication in the semiconductor manufacturing. Our results demonstrate that the benefit of integrated decision making increases when maintenance is less expensive relative to lost production cost and that a longer horizon for maintenance planning is beneficial when maintenance cost increases.

AB In this paper we study differences between contiguous and non-contiguous parallel task schedules. Parallel tasks can be executed on more than one processor simultaneously. In the contiguous schedules, indices of the processors assigned to a task must be a sequence of consecutive numbers. In the non-contiguous schedules, processor indices may be arbitrary. Optimum non-preemptive schedules are considered. Given a parallel task instance, the optimum contiguous and non-contiguous schedules can be of different lengths. We analyze minimal instances where such a difference may arise, provide bounds on the difference of the two schedules lengths, and prove that deciding whether the difference in schedule length exists is NP-complete.

AB Subcontracting allows manufacturer agents to reduce completion times of their jobs and thus obtain savings. This paper addresses the coordination of decentralized scheduling systems with a single subcontractor and several agents having divisible jobs. Assuming complete information, we design parametric pricing schemes that strongly coordinate this decentralized system, i.e., the agents' choices of subcontracting intervals always result in efficient schedules. The subcontractor's revenue under the pricing schemes depends on a single parameter which can be chosen to make the revenue as close to the total savings as required. Also, we give a lower bound on the subcontractor's revenue for any coordinating pricing scheme. Allowing private information about processing times, we prove that the pivotal mechanism is coordinating, i.e., agents are better off by reporting their true processing times, and by participating in the subcontracting. We show that the subcontractor's maximum revenue with any coordinating mechanism under private information equals the lower bound of that with coordinating pricing schemes under complete information. Finally, we address the asymmetric case where agents obtain savings at different rates per unit reduction in completion times. We show that coordinating pricing schemes do not always exist in this case.

AB In this paper we suggest a new, intuitive, and simple method for scheduling jobs in a two-server flow-shop network (FSN) with the minimum makespan objective. Multiple types of jobs with corresponding constant service times arrive at the network at various times over a finite time interval. An analog fluid network is proposed and its optimal fluid control policy determined. We make use of this optimal control policy to suggest a new method for scheduling jobs in the original discrete FSN and prove its asymptotic optimality. The method is particularly attractive because it falls into the class of easy-to-implement and computationally inexpensive on-line algorithms. Numerical simulations are used to evaluate the performance of the suggested method and show that it performs optimally in almost all simulated instances. Some additional properties of the network are discussed and illustrated.

AB The problem of scheduling jobs on an unreliable single machine is considered in this paper. The scheduling problem is characterized by the following features: jobs are grouped into classes of equivalent jobs; the generalized due date model is adopted for each class of jobs; it is possible to reduce the processing time of a job, at the price of the payment of an extra cost; a costly setup is required when switching between jobs of different classes. The scheduling problem is solved from a perspective which is different from the traditional determination of an optimal sequence of jobs; in fact, the objective of the paper is to determine optimal control strategies (functions of the system state) which allow generating the optimal decisions during the evolution of the system, taking into account the actual system state. In this way, optimal decisions can be promptly taken also in the presence of perturbations which affect the single machine (such as breakdowns and slowdowns). To this aim, a specific optimal control problem is stated and solved in the paper.

AB In this paper we propose an efficient offline job scheduling algorithm working in a grid environment that is based on a relatively new evolutionary metaheuristic called generalized extremal optimization (GEO). We compare our experimental results with those obtained using a very popular evolutionary metaheuristic, the genetic algorithm (GA). The scheduling algorithm implies two-stage scheduling. In the first stage, the algorithm allocates jobs to suitable machines of a grid; GEO/GA is used for this purpose. In the second stage, jobs are independently scheduled on each machine; this is performed with a variant of a list scheduling algorithm. Both GEO and GA belong to the class of evolutionary algorithms, but GEO is much simpler and requires the tuning of only one parameter, whereas GA requires the tuning of several parameters. The results of the experimental study show that GEO, despite its simplicity, outperforms the GA in a whole range of scheduling instances and is much easier to use.

AB We introduce and analyze the interval shop scheduling problem, where the objective is to maximize the weighted number of jobs that can be processed in a two-stage flow shop, job shop, or open shop, where each job has a fixed start and end time and requires a given transportation time, i.e., a time lag, for moving from one stage to the other. This problem is a natural extension of the parallel-machine scheduling problem with fixed start and end times, which is relatively well understood. We prove that the two-machine interval flow shop problem is -hard in the strong sense for general time lags, even in the case of equal processing times and equal weights. The problem is solvable in polynomial time if all time lags are equal. The two-machine interval job shop problem is solvable in time if the time lags are equal and relatively small. For the two-machine interval open shop problem, this is true as well.

AB Westside High School (WHS) of Omaha, Nebraska utilizes a sophisticated scheduling environment called "modular scheduling." Modular scheduling empowers teachers with the ability to design the structure of their classes by adjusting the frequency, duration, and location of each of their lessons. This paper presents a novel heuristic methodology, implemented as a computer program called the sequential modular algorithmic routines for timetabling (SMART) Scheduler, which creates cohesive modular class schedules using effective techniques such as ejection trees and student sectioning. In experimentation, the SMART Scheduler is able to schedule over 2,800 distinct lessons in less than 4 s using data provided by WHS. This paper describes algorithms within the SMART Scheduler as well as computational results of its implementation.

   Timetabling Competition 2011
AB Recently, the XHSTT format for high school timetabling was introduced. It provides a uniform way of modeling problem instances and corresponding solutions. The format supports a wide variety of constraints, and currently 38 real-life instances from 11 different countries are available. Thereby, the XHSTT format serves as a common ground for researchers within this area. This paper describes the first exact method capable of handling an arbitrary instance of the XHSTT format. The method is based on a mixed-integer linear programming (MIP) model, which is solved in two steps with a commercial general-purpose MIP solver. Computational results show that our approach is able to find previously unknown optimal solutions for 2 instances of XHSTT and proves optimality of 4 known solutions. For the instances not solved to optimality, new non-trivial lower bounds were found in 11 cases, and new best known solutions were found in 9 cases. Furthermore, the approach is compared with the finalists of Round 2 of the International Timetabling Competition 2011 and is shown to be competitive with one of the finalists.

AB There are a variety of joint job production and transportation scheduling problems that arise in modern manufacturing systems. In this paper, we study two such problems that arise in a flowshop environment where there are two processing stages and a single transporter that is available to deliver the finished jobs from the first stage to the second. In the first problem, there is a single machine in each of the two flowshop stages and jobs have different sizes when loaded onto the transporter. In the second problem, there are two parallel machines in the first stage and a single machine in the second stage, and the transporter can carry only one job in each shipment. The objective of both problems is to minimize the makespan, i.e., the completion time of the last job in the second stage. The two problems are both strongly NP-hard. For each problem, we propose a fast heuristic and show that the heuristic has a tight worst-case bound of 2.

AB We study a scheduling problem, in which jobs of two agents are performed in agent specific batches on the same serial unbounded batching machine. On this machine, jobs of the same batch complete simultaneously, and the batch processing time is equal to the total processing time of its jobs plus a setup time. Each agent aims at minimizing a function which depends only on the completion times of its jobs. The problem is to find a schedule that minimizes the objective function of one agent, subject to the objective function of the other agent does not exceed a given threshold. The problem appears in optimizing product consolidation operations of a cross-docking distribution center. Polynomial and pseudo-polynomial dynamic programming algorithms are derived for settings with various combinations of the objective functions.

DE Scheduling with continuous resources; Energy requirement; Energetic

ID PROJECT; PROPAGATION; GENERATION
AB This paper addresses a scheduling problem with continuous resources and energy constraints. Given a set of non-preemptive activities, each activity requires a continuously divisible resource whose instantaneous usage is limited in maximum and minimum, its processing satisfying a time window and a total energy (time resource-usage) requirement. The goal consists of getting a schedule satisfying all the constraints. The problem, which we refer to as the Energy-Constrained Scheduling Problem with Continuous Resources (CECSP), is a generalization of the well-known cumulative scheduling problem for which the "energetic reasoning" or "left-shift/right-shift" necessary feasibility condition yielded a popular polynomially computable satisfiability test. The paper presents a generalization of the energetic reasoning for the CECSP, defining precisely the activity minimum consumptions and exhibiting a polynomial number of relevant time intervals on which it is sufficient to apply the satisfiability tests. A strongly polynomial energetic reasoning satisfiability test can be derived for the considered generalization, which also yields a short proof for the complexity of the original algorithm. Some limits of the approach, as well as an approximation framework for more general resource consumption functions, are also addressed.

ID COMPETING AGENTS; MODEL
AB In this paper, we address a deterministic scheduling problem in which two agents compete for the usage of a single machine. Each agent decides on a fixed order to submit its tasks to an external coordination subject, who sequences them according to a known priority rule. We consider the problem from different perspectives. First, we characterize the set of Pareto-optimal schedules in terms of size and computational complexity. We then address the problem from the single-agent point-of-view, that is, we consider the problem of deciding how to submit one agent's tasks only taking into account its own objective function against the other agent, the opponent. In this regard, we consider two different settings depending on the information available to the agents: In one setting, the considered agent knows in advance all information about the submission sequence of the opponent; and in the second setting (as in minimax strategies in game theory), the agent has no information on the opponent strategy and wants to devise a strategy that minimizes its solution cost in the worst possible case. Finally, we assess the performance of some classical single-agent sequencing rules in the two-agent setting.

ID SCHEDULING PROBLEM; NETWORKS; UNCERTAINTY; SEARCH
AB The resource-constrained project scheduling problem (RCPSP) has been widely studied. A fundamental assumption of the basic type of RCPSP is that activity durations are deterministic (i.e., they are known in advance). In reality, however, this is almost never the case. In this article, we illustrate why it is important to incorporate activity duration uncertainty, and develop an exact procedure to optimally solve the stochastic resource-constrained scheduling problem. A computational experiment shows that our approach works best when solving small- to medium-sized problem instances where activity durations have a moderate-to-high level of variability. For this setting, our model outperforms the existing state-of-the-art. In addition, we use our model to assess the optimality gap of existing heuristic approaches, and investigate the impact of making scheduling decisions also during the execution of an activity rather than only at the end of an activity.

AB In this paper, we introduce a new kind of constraint, called a core precedence constraint, in a cyclic resource-constrained project scheduling problem (RCPSP) with precedence delays. We show, by an example, which kind of industrial constraints might be modeled by such core precedences in a periodic production setting. We then establish that these constraints can be quite easily added to an integer linear programming formulation of the cyclic RCPSP. Although core precedences seem to be very similar to classical precedence, they can induce infeasibility even without resource constraints. Moreover, we show that the feasibility checking problem is NP-complete in the strong sense, even assuming unit processing times and no resource constraints.

AB The resource availability cost problem (RACP) (Mohring, Operations Research, 32:89-120, 1984) is commonly encountered in project scheduling. RACP aims to minimize the resource availability cost of a project by a given project deadline. In this study, RACP is extended from a single mode to a multi-mode called multi-mode RACP (MMRACP), which is more complicated than RACP but more convenient in practice. To solve MMRACP efficiently, forward activity list (FAL), a schedule generation scheme, is proposed. Heuristic algorithms are designed according to the characteristics of FAL to repair infeasible solutions and to improve the fitness of the solution. Modified particle swarm optimization (MPSO), which combines the advantages of particle swarm optimization and scatter search, is proposed to make the search for the best solution efficient. Computational experiments involving 180 instances are performed to validate the performance of the proposed algorithm. The results reveal that MPSO using FAL is a very effective method to solve MMRACP.

AB We consider a scheduling problem in which the criterion for assigning due dates is to make them as tight as possible, while the criterion for sequencing jobs is to minimize their tardiness. Because these two criteria conflict, we examine the trade-off between the tightness of the due dates and the tardiness of the jobs. We formulate a version of this trade-off in the case of a stochastic single-machine model with normally distributed processing times. Using lower bounds and dominance properties to curtail the enumeration, we develop a branch-and- bound procedure that is capable of solving large versions of the problem, and we report the results of computational experiments involving several hundred test problems.

AB This paper considers scheduling problems on two machines to minimise the makespan. It shows that a simple cyclical search can find a flow shop schedule with one job omitted with makespan less than or equal to the maximum of the total processing time of all jobs on either machine. This flow shop schedule is used as the basis for constructing a number of schedules with minimum makespan for the two machine open shop. The search may be applied unchanged to batches of jobs to provide more optimal schedules.

TI A note on the preemptive scheduling to minimize total completion time

SO JOURNAL OF SCHEDULING
LA English
DT Article
DE Preemptive scheduling; Release time; Deadline; NP-hard
AB In this paper, we consider two problems about the preemptive scheduling of a set of jobs with release times on a single machine. In the first problem, each job has a deadline. The objective is to find a feasible schedule which minimizes the total completion time of the jobs. In the second problem (called two-agent scheduling problem), the set of jobs is partitioned into two subsets and . Each job in has a deadline. The objective is to find a feasible schedule which minimizes the total completion time of the jobs in . For the first problem, Du and Leung (Journal of Algorithms 14:45-68, 1993) showed that the problem is NP-hard. We show in this paper that there is a flaw in their NP-hardness proof. For the second problem, Leung et al. (Operations Research 58:458-469, 2010) showed that the problem can be solved in polynomial time. Yuan et al. (Private Communication) showed that their polynomial-time algorithm is invalid so the complexity of the second problem is still open. In this paper, by a modification of Du and Leung's NP-hardness proof, we show that the first problem is NP-hard even when the jobs have only two distinct deadlines. Using the same reduction, we also show that the second problem is NP-hard even when the jobs in has a common deadline and a common release time 0.

AB We study a scheduling problem in which jobs may be split into parts, where the parts of a split job may be processed simultaneously on more than one machine. Each part of a job requires a setup time, however, on the machine where the job part is processed. During setup, a machine cannot process or set up any other job. We concentrate on the basic case in which setup times are job-, machine- and sequence-independent. Problems of this kind were encountered when modelling practical problems in planning disaster relief operations. Our main algorithmic result is a polynomial-time algorithm for minimising total completion time on two parallel identical machines. We argue, why the same problem with three machines is not an easy extension of the two-machine case, leaving the complexity of this case as a tantalising open problem. We give a constant-factor approximation algorithm for the general case with any number of machines and a polynomial-time approximation scheme for a fixed number of machines. For the version with the objective to minimise total weighted completion time, we prove NP-hardness. Finally, we conclude with an overview of the state of the art for other split scheduling problems with job-, machine- and sequence-independent setup times.

   MANAGEMENT; ALGORITHMS; NUMBER
AB In this paper, a scheduling problem is considered which arises in the packaging industry. Plastic and foil wrappers used for packaging candy bars, crisps and other snacks typically require overlay printing with multiple colours. Printing machines used for this purpose usually accommodate a small number of colours which are loaded into a magazine simultaneously. If two consecutively scheduled print jobs require significantly different colour overlays, then substantial down times are incurred during the transition from the former magazine colour configuration to the latter, because ink cartridges corresponding to colours not required for the latter job have to be cleaned after completion of the former job. The durations of these down times are therefore sequence dependent (the washing and refilling time is a function of the number of colours in which two consecutive printing jobs differ). It is consequently desirable to schedule print jobs so that the accumulated down times associated with all magazine colour transitions are as short as possible for each printing machine. We show that an instance of this scheduling problem can be modelled as the well-known tool switching problem, which is tractable for small instances only. The problem can, however, be solved rather effectively in heuristic fashion by decomposing it into two subproblems: a job grouping problem (which can be modelled as a unicost set covering problem) and a group sequencing problem (which is a generalisation of the celebrated travelling salesman problem). We solve the colour print scheduling problem both exactly and heuristically for small, randomly generated test problem instances, studying the trade-off between the time efficiency and solution quality of the two approaches. Finally, we apply both solution approaches to real problem data obtained from a printing company in the South African Western Cape as a special case study.

AB In this paper, we present a new scheduling problem and describe a shortest path-based heuristic as well as a dynamic programming-based exact optimization algorithm to solve it. The selective multi-category parallel-servicing problem arises when a set of jobs has to be scheduled on a server (machine) with limited capacity. Each job requests service in a prespecified time window and belongs to a certain category. Jobs may be serviced partially, incurring a penalty; however, only jobs of the same category can be processed simultaneously. One must identify the best subset of jobs to process in each time interval of a given planning horizon, while respecting the server capacity and scheduling requirements. We compare the proposed solution methods with a Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) formulation and show that the dynamic programming approach is faster when the number of categories is large, whereas the MILP can be solved faster when the number of categories is small.

AB One of the basic and fundamental scheduling problems is to minimize the machine completion time vector in the norm, a direct extension of the well-studied objective makespan ( norm), on parallel machines. We concentrate on the on-line and preemptive version of this problem where jobs arrive one by one over a list to be allocated to two uniform machines with job preemption permitted. We present a best possible deterministic on-line scheduling algorithm for this problem along with a matching lower bound, generalizing existing results for the identical machines scheduling problem in the literature. One notable feature of this work is the highly involved technicality compared to similar analysis in the existing literature, mainly due to the intrinsic unavailability of a closed-form formula for the competitive ratio.

AB This paper addresses a multi-activity multi-day shift scheduling problem in a continuous and flexible environment including a heterogeneous workforce. Given days-off schedules associated with each employee, our objective is to construct and assign admissible multi-activity shifts to employees on their work days in a way that minimizes under-staffing and over-staffing with a restricted budget on workforce cost. A hybrid heuristic which combines tabu search with a branch-and-bound procedure is proposed to solve the problem. The computational experiments prove that our method provides good schedules in relatively short computing times.

AB We consider two-agent scheduling on a single machine with release dates and preemption to minimize the maximum lateness. In this scheduling model, there are two agents each having his own job set , respectively. Each job has a release date and the jobs need to be preemptively scheduled on a single machine. Leung et al. (Oper Res 58:458-469, 2010) present a comprehensive study of two-agent scheduling in various machine environments. They show that problem can be solved in time. They use the strategy that schedules the jobs of agent without preemption as late as possible under the restriction . We show that the strategy fails to work even when , invalidating their result. We then study the minimization problem and the Pareto optimization problem . We show that the two problems can be solved in time, respectively.

AB An event in a schedule is a job start, interruption, resumption or completion time. A shift in a schedule is an non-idling interval between two events that does not contain other events. If a scheduling problem with a regular criterion has only integer data (and we consider here only such problems), then the length of smallest shifts required in optimal nonpreemptive schedules is obviously 1. The length of smallest shifts required in optimal preemptive schedules, however, can be infinitely small. As Sauer and Stone (Order 4:195-206, 1987) showed more than 25 years ago, shifts of length less than are not required in shortest preemptive schedules of unit-length jobs with precedence constraints on identical parallel machines. They showed, on the other hand, that there are instances for infinitely many such that shifts of length less than can be required if . In this paper, we continue research in the same direction and strengthen their results, finding the respective tighter bounds, and . We also obtain similar results for other preemptive scheduling problems on identical parallel machines. A useful consequence of certain of these results is that preemptive scheduling problems with unequal release dates and/or unequal due dates can require even smaller shifts for optimality. We also identify problems whose optimal preemptive schedules do not require shifts of length less than 1/m.

AB Scheduling in semiconductor manufacturing is of vital importance due to the impact on production performance indicators such as equipment utilization, cycle time, and delivery times. With the increasing complexity of semiconductor manufacturing, ever-new products and demanding customers, scheduling plans for efficient production control become crucial. Scheduling and control are mutually dependent as control requires information from scheduling, for example, where jobs are processed, and scheduling requires control information, for example, on which equipment operations can be processed. Based on a survey of the literature, this article proposes a review and an outlook for the potential improvements by binding scheduling decisions and information coming from advanced process control systems in semiconductor manufacturing.

AB There are many situations when, due to unexpected delays, the supplier may not be able to deliver some orders by the promised due dates. We present a model for quoting attainable delivery times to minimize tardiness penalties and delivery costs, when deliveries take place in batches. We show that the general problem is strongly -hard, but when all orders have the same per-unit due-date-assignment cost, it is -hard only in the ordinary sense. For the latter case, we present a pseudo-polynomial algorithm, which is converted into a fully polynomial-time approximation scheme. If the tardiness penalties are also identical, we show that the problem can be solved in polynomial time.

AB This paper introduces a shift rostering problem that surprisingly has not been studied in the literature: the weekend shift rostering problem. It is motivated by our experience that employees' shift preferences predominantly focus on the weekends, since many social activities happen during weekends. The weekend rostering problem (WRP) addresses the rostering of weekend shifts, for which we design a problem-specific heuristic. We consider the WRP as the first phase of the shift rostering problem. To complete the shift roster, the second phase assigns the weekday shifts. This decomposition reflects how shift rosters are often created manually in practice, which makes the decomposition method proposed in this paper a more intuitive approach for business users compared to approaches without this decomposition. We believe that such approaches enable business users to effectively analyze and steer the outcomes of algorithms for shift rostering especially on criteria that are relevant to them such as those concerning weekends. We analyze and discuss effects of this two-phase approach both on the weekend shift roster and on the roster as a whole. We demonstrate that our first-phase weekend rostering heuristic is effective both on generated instances and real-life instances. For situations where the weekend shift roster is one of the key determinants of the quality of the complete roster, our two-phase approach is shown to be effective.

AB We study mechanism design for a single-server setting where jobs require compensation for waiting, while waiting cost is private information to the jobs. With given priors on the private information of jobs, we aim to find a Bayes-Nash incentive compatible mechanism that minimizes the total expected payments to the jobs. Following earlier work in the auction literature, we show that this problem is solved, in polynomial time, by a version of Smith's rule. When both waiting cost and processing times are private, we show that optimal mechanisms generally do not satisfy an independence condition known as IIA, and conclude that a closed form for optimal mechanisms is generally not conceivable.

DE Multi-project scheduling; Learning automata; Dispersion games
ID HEURISTIC RULES PERFORMANCE; DECOMPOSITION APPROACH; SYSTEM; MODEL
AB The present paper introduces a learning-based optimization approach to the resource-constrained multi-project scheduling problem. Multiple projects, each with their own set of activities, need to be scheduled. The objectives dealt with here include minimization of the average project delay and total makespan. The availability of local and global resources, precedence relations between activities, and non-equal project start times have to be considered. The proposed approach relies on a simple sequence learning game played by a group of project managers. The project managers each learn their activity list locally using reinforcement learning, more specifically learning automata. Meanwhile, they learn how to choose a suitable place in the overall sequence of all activity lists. All the projects need to arrive at a unique place in this sequence. A mediator, who usually has to solve a complex optimization problem, now manages a simple dispersion game. Through the mediator, a sequence of feasible activity lists is eventually scheduled by using a serial schedule generation scheme, which is adopted from single project scheduling. It is shown that the sequence learning approach has a large positive effect on minimizing the average project delay. In fact, the combination of local reinforcement learning, the sequence learning game and a forward-backward implementation of the serial scheduler significantly improves the best known results for all the MPSPLIB datasets. In addition, several new best results were obtained for both considered objectives: minimizing the average project delay and minimizing the total makespan.

AB We study a set of scheduling problems on a uniform machine setting. We focus on the case of equal processing time jobs with the additional feature of job rejection. Jobs can either be processed on a predefined set of machines or rejected. Rejected jobs incur a rejection penalty and have no effect on the scheduling criterion under consideration. A solution to our problems consists of partitioning the jobs into two subsets, and , which are the set of accepted and the set of rejected jobs, respectively. In addition, jobs in set have to be scheduled on the machines. We evaluate the quality of a solution by two criteria. The first, , can be any regular scheduling criterion, while the latter, , is the total rejection cost. We consider two possible types of regular scheduling criteria; the former is a maximization criterion, while the latter is a summation criterion. For each criterion type we consider four different problem variations. We prove that all four variations are solvable in polynomial time for maximization type of a regular scheduling criterion. When the scheduling criterion is of summation type, we show that only one of the four problem variations is solvable in polynomial time. We provide a pseudo-polynomial time algorithms to solve interesting variants of the -hard problems, as well as a polynomial time algorithm that solves various other special cases.

AB In this paper, we consider a single-machine scheduling problem (P) inspired from manufacturing instances. A release date, a deadline, and a regular (i.e., non-decreasing) cost function are associated with each job. The problem takes into account sequence-dependent setup times and setup costs between jobs of different families. Moreover, the company has the possibility to reject some jobs/orders, in which case a penalty (abandon cost) is incurred. Therefore, the problem at hand can be viewed as an order acceptance and scheduling problem. Order acceptance problems have gained interest among the research community over the last decades, particularly in a make-to-order environment. We propose and compare a constructive heuristic, local search methods, and population-based algorithms. Tests are performed on realistic instances and show that the developed metaheuristics significantly outperform the currently available resolution methods for the same problem.

AB In this paper, we initiate the study of minimizing power consumption in the broadcast scheduling model. In this setting, there is a wireless transmitter. Over time requests arrive at the transmitter for pages of information. Multiple requests may be for the same page. When a page is transmitted, all requests for that page receive the transmission simultaneously. The speed the transmitter sends data at can be dynamically scaled to conserve energy. We consider the problem of minimizing flow time plus energy, the most popular scheduling metric considered in the standard online scheduling model when the scheduler is energy aware. We will assume that the power consumed is modeled by an arbitrary convex function. For this problem, there is an lower bound on the competitive ratio. Due to the lower bound, we consider using resource augmentation and give a scalable algorithm.

TI Nash equilibria for the multi-agent project scheduling problem with
   controllable processing times
SO JOURNAL OF SCHEDULING

AB This paper considers a project scheduling environment in which the activities of the project network are partitioned among a set of agents. Activity durations are controllable, i.e., every agent is allowed to shorten the duration of its activities, incurring a crashing cost. If the project makespan is reduced with respect to its normal value, a reward is offered to the agents and each agent receives a given ratio of the total reward. Agents want to maximize their profit. Assuming a complete knowledge of the agents' parameters and of the activity network, this problem is modeled as a non-cooperative game and Nash equilibria are analyzed. We characterize Nash equilibria in terms of the existence of certain types of cuts on the project network. We show that finding one Nash equilibrium is easy, while finding a Nash strategy that minimizes the project makespan is NP-hard in the strong sense. The particular case where each activity belongs to a different agent is also studied and some polynomial-time algorithms are proposed for this case.
