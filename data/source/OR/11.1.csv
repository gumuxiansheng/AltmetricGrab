AB Given the growing importance of service supply chain management (SSCM) in operations, we review a selection of papers in the operations research and the management science (OR/MS) literature that focus on innovative measures associated with the SSCM. First, we review and discuss the definitions of service supply chains (SSCs) and categorize SSCs into the Service Only Supply Chains (SOSCs) and the Product Service Supply Chains (PSSCs). Second, by classifying the literature into three major areas, namely service supply management, service demand management, and the coordination of service supply chains, we derive insights into the current state of knowledge in each area, and examine the evolution of the SSCM research over the past decade. Finally, we identify some associated research challenges and explore future directions for research on SSCM from an operational perspective.

DE Assignment; Partitioning; Maximum matching; Bipartite graph; Container

AB We introduce and analyze the Partitioning Min-Max Weighted Matching (PMMWM) Problem. PMMWM combines the problem of partitioning a set of vertices of a bipartite graph into disjoint subsets of restricted size and the strongly NP-hard Min-Max Weighted Matching (MMWM) Problem, that has recently been introduced in the literature. In contrast to PMMWM, the latter problem assumes the partitioning to be given. Applications arise in the field of intermodal container terminals and sea ports. We propose a MILP formulation for PMMWM and prove that the problem is NP-hard in the strong sense. Two heuristic frameworks are presented. Both of them outperform standard optimization software. Our extensive computational study proves that the algorithms provide high quality solutions within reasonable time.

AB We consider the problem of scheduling a set of n jobs on m identical and parallel batching machines. The machines have identical capacities equal to K and the jobs have identical processing times equal to p. Job j has a size s(j), a due date d(j) and a profit R-j. Several jobs can be batched together and processed by a machine, provided that the total size of the jobs in the batch does not exceed the machine capacity K. The company Will earn a profit of R-j dollars if job j is delivered by time d(j); otherwise, it earns nothing. A third party logistic (3PL) provider will be used to deliver the jobs. The 3PL provider picks up the jobs at times T-1 < T-2 < ... < T-z, and v(k) (1 <= k <= z) vehicles will be provided for delivery at time T-k. The vehicles have identical capacities equal to C. The objective is to find a production and delivery schedule so as to maximize the total profit that the company can earn. We show that the problem is solvable in polynomial time if the jobs have identical sizes, but it becomes unary NP-hard if the jobs have different sizes. We propose heuristics for various NP-hard cases and analyze their performances.

TI A speed and departure time optimization algorithm for the

SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF OPERATIONAL RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
DE Routing; Speed optimization; Departure optimization; Green logistics
AB We propose a new speed and departure time optimization algorithm for the pollution-routing problem (PRP), which runs in quadratic time and returns an optimal schedule. This algorithm is embedded into an iterated local search-based metaheuristic to achieve a combined speed, scheduling and routing optimization. The start of the working day is set as a decision variable for individual routes, thus enabling a better assignment of human resources to required demands. Some routes that were evaluated as unprofitable can now appear as viable candidates later in the day, leading to a larger search space and further opportunities of distance optimization via better service consolidation. Extensive computational experiments on available PRP benchmark instances demonstrate the good performance of the algorithm. The flexible departure times from the depot contribute to reduce the operational costs by 8.36% on the considered instances.

AB In this paper we consider a routing problem where uncapacitated vehicles are loaded with goods, requested by the customers, that arrive at the depot over time. The arrival time of a product at the depot is called its release date. We consider two variants of the problem. In the first one a deadline to complete the distribution is given and the total distance traveled is minimized. In the second variant no deadline is given and the total time needed to complete the distribution is minimized. While both variants are in general NP-hard, we show that they can be solved in polynomial time if the underlying graph has a special structure.

AB We extend the well-known spatial competition model (d'Aspremont, Gabszewicz & Thisse, 1979) to a continuous time model in which two firms compete in each instance. Our focus is on the entry timing decisions of firms and their optimal locations. We demonstrate that the leader has an incentive to locate closer to the center to delay the follower's entry, leading to a non-maximum differentiation outcome. We also investigate how exogenous parameters affect the leader's location and firms' values and, in particular, numerically show that the profit of the leader changes non-monotonically with an increase in the transport cost parameter.

AB A problem of profit oriented disassembly line design and balancing with possible partial disassembly and presence of hazardous parts is studied. The objective is to design a production line providing a maximal revenue with balanced workload. Task times are assumed to be random variables with known normal probability distributions. The cycle time constraints are to be jointly satisfied with at least a predetermined probability level. An AND/OR graph is used to Model the precedence relationships among tasks. Several lower and upper-bounding schemes are developed using second order cone programming and convex piecewise linear approximation. To show the relevance and applicability of the proposed approach, a set of instances from the literature are solved to optimality.

AB This research proposes a bi-level model for the mixed network design problem (MNDP). The upper level problem involves redesigning the current road links' directions, expanding their capacity, and determining signal settings at intersections to optimize the reserve capacity of the whole system. The lower level problem is the user equilibrium traffic assignment problem. By proving that the optimal arc flow solution of the bi-level problem must exist in the boundary of capacity constraints, an exact line search method called golden section search is embedded in a scatter search method for solving this complicated MNDP. The algorithm is then applied to some real cases and finally, some conclusions are drawn on the model's efficiency. Crown Copyright (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB We introduce a novel metaheuristic methodology to improve the initialization of a given deterministic or stochastic optimization algorithm. Our objective is to improve the performance of the considered algorithm, called core optimization algorithm, by reducing its number of cost function evaluations, by increasing its success rate and by boosting the precision of its results. In our approach, the core optimization is considered as a sub-optimization problem for a multi-layer line search method. The approach is presented and implemented for various particular core optimization algorithms: Steepest Descent, Heavy-Ball, Genetic Algorithm, Differential Evolution and Controlled Random Search. We validate our methodology by considering a set of low and high dimensional benchmark problems (i.e., problems of dimension between 2 and 1000). The results are compared to those obtained with the core optimization algorithms alone and with two additional global optimization methods (Direct Tabu Search and Continuous Greedy Randomized Adaptive Search). These latter also aim at improving the initial condition for the core algorithms. The numerical results seem to indicate that our approach improves the performances of the core optimization algorithms and allows to generate algorithms more efficient than the other optimization methods studied here. A Matlab optimization package called "Global Optimization Platform" (GOP), implementing the algorithms presented here, has been developed and can be downloaded at: http://www.matmcm.es/momatisoftware.htm (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. and Association of European Operational Research Societies (EURO) within the International Federation of Operational Research Societies (IFORS).

AB This study concerns a method of selecting the best subset of explanatory variables in a multiple linear regression model. Goodness-of-fit measures, for example, adjusted R-2, AIC, and BIC, are generally used to evaluate a subset regression model. Although variable selection with regard to these measures is usually performed with a stepwise regression method, it does not always provide the best subset of explanatory variables. In this paper, we propose mixed integer second-order cone programming formulations for selecting the best subset of variables with respect to adjusted R-2, AIC, and BIC. Computational experiments show that, in terms of these measures, the proposed formulations yield better solutions than those provided by common stepwise regression methods.

ID EVOLUTIONARY ALGORITHMS; OBJECTIVES
AB Recently, multi-objective particle swarm optimization (MOPSO) has shown the effectiveness in solving multi-objective optimization problems (MOPs). However, most MOPSO algorithms only adopt a single search strategy to update the velocity of each particle, which may cause some difficulties when tackling complex MOPs. This paper proposes a novel MOPSO algorithm using multiple search strategies (MMOPSO), where decomposition approach is exploited for transforming MOPs into a set of aggregation problems and then each particle is assigned accordingly to optimize each aggregation problem. Two search strategies are designed to update the velocity of each particle, which is respectively beneficial for the acceleration of convergence speed and the keeping of population diversity. After that, all the non-dominated solutions visited by the particles are preserved in an external archive, where evolutionary search strategy is further performed to exchange useful information among them. These multiple search strategies enable MMOPSO to handle various kinds of MOPs very well. When compared with some MOPSO algorithms and two state-of-the-art evolutionary algorithms, simulation results show that MMOPSO performs better on most of test problems.

AB Dispersion is a desirable element inherent in many location problems. For example, dispersive strategies are used in the location of franchise stores, bank branches, defensive missile silo placement, halfway homes, and correctional facilities, or where there is need to be dispersed as much as possible in order to minimize impacts. Two classic models that capture the essence of dispersion between facilities involve: (1) locating exactly p-facilities while maximizing the smallest distance of separation between any two of them, and (2) maximizing the number of facilities that are being located subject to the condition that each facility is no closer than r-distance to its closest neighboring facility. The latter of these two problems is called the anticovering problem, the subject of this paper. Virtually all past research has involved an attempt to solve for the "best or maximal packing" solution to a given anti-covering problem. This paper deals with what one may call the worst case solution of an anti-covering problem. That is, what is the smallest number of needed facilities and their placement such that their placement thwarts or prevents any further facility placement without violating the r-separation requirement? We call this the disruptive anti-covering location problem. It is disruptive in the sense that such a solution would efficiently prevent an optimal packing from occurring. We present an integer linear program model for this new location problem, provide example problems which indicate that very disruptive configurations exist, and discuss the generation of a range of stable levels to this problem.

AB We investigate the inverse convex ordered 1-median problem on unweighted trees under the cost functions related to the Chebyshev norm and the Hamming distance. By the special structure of the problem under Chebyshev norm, we deduce the so-called maximum modification to modify the edge lengths of the tree. Additionally, the cost function of the problem receives only finite values under the bottleneck Hamming distance. Therefore, we can find the optimal cost of the problem by applying binary search. It is shown that both of the problems, under Chebyshev norm and under the bottleneck Hamming distance, can be solved in O(n(2)log n) time in all situations, with or without essential topology changes. Here, n is the number of vertices of the tree. Finally, we prove that the problem under weighted sum Hamming distance is NP-hard.

AB We present a scheme for coordinating decentralized parties that share central resources but hold private information about their decision problems modeled as linear programs. This setting is of particular importance for supply chains, in which the plans of independent, often legally separated, parties have to be synchronized. The scheme is based on an iterative generation and exchange of proposals regarding the parties' input to or withdrawal from the central resources (i.e. primal information). We prove that the system-wide optimum can be identified in a finite number of steps. A simple numerical example illustrates the information exchange and the models involved when coordinating a two-stage supply chain.

AB Owing to the technological innovations and the changing consumer perceptions, remanufacturing has gained vast economic potential in the past decade. Nevertheless, major OEMs, in a variety of sectors, remain reluctant about establishing their own remanufacturing capability and use recycling as a means to satisfy the extended producer responsibility. Their main concerns seem to be the potential for the cannibalization of their primary market by remanufactured products and the uncertainty in the return stream in terms of its volume and quality. This paper aims at assisting OEMs in the development of their remanufacturing strategy, with an outlook of pursuing the opportunities presented by the inherent uncertainties. We present a two-stage stochastic closed-loop supply chain design model that incorporates the uncertainties in the market size, the return volume as well as the quality of the returns. The proposed framework also explicitly represents the difference in customer valuations of the new and the remanufactured products. The arising stochastic mixed-integer quadratic program is not amenable to solution via commercial software. Therefore, we develop a solution procedure by integrating sample average approximation with the integer L-shaped method. In order to gather solid managerial insights, we present a case study based on BSH, a leading producer of home appliances headquartered in Germany. Our analysis reveals that, while the reverse network configuration is rather robust, the extent of the firm's involvement in remanufacturing is quite sensitive to the costs associated with each product recovery option as well as the relative valuation of the remanufactured products by the customers. In the context of the BSH case, we find that among the sources of uncertainty, the market size has the most profound effect on the overall profitability, and it is desirable to build sufficient expansion flexibility in the forward network configuration.

AB This paper investigates the weak convergence of general non-Gaussian GARCH models together with an application to the pricing of European style options determined using an extended Girsanov principle and a conditional Esscher transform as the pricing kernel candidates. Applying these changes of measure to asymmetric GARCH models sampled at increasing frequencies, we obtain two risk neutral families of processes which converge to different bivariate diffusions, which are no longer standard Hull White stochastic volatility models. Regardless of the innovations used, the GARCH implied diffusion limit based on the Esscher transform can be obtained by applying the minimal martingale measure under the physical measure. However, we further show that for skewed GARCH driving noise, the risk neutral diffusion limit of the extended Girsanov principle exhibits a non-zero market price of volatility risk which is proportional to the market price of the equity risk, where the constant of proportionality depends on the skewness and kurtosis of the underlying distribution. Our theoretical results are further supported by numerical simulations and a calibration exercise to observed market quotes.

AB The motivation of this paper is to introduce a hybrid Rolling Genetic Algorithm-Support Vector Regression (RG-SVR) model for optimal parameter selection and feature subset combination. The algorithm is applied to the task of forecasting and trading the EUR/USD, EUR/GBP and EUR/JPY exchange rates. The proposed methodology genetically searches over a feature space (pool of individual forecasts) and then combines the optimal feature subsets (SVR forecast combinations) for each exchange rate. This is achieved by applying a fitness function specialized for financial purposes and adopting a sliding window approach. The individual forecasts are derived from several linear and non-linear models. RG-SVR is benchmarked against genetically and non-genetically optimized SVRs and SVMs models that are dominating the relevant literature, along with the robust ARBF-PSO neural network. The statistical and trading performance of all models is investigated during the period of 1999-2012. As it turns out, RG-SVR presents the best performance in terms of statistical accuracy and trading efficiency for all the exchange rates under study. This superiority confirms the success of the implemented fitness function and training procedure, while it validates the benefits of the proposed algorithm.

AB In this paper we study a continuous time stochastic inventory model for a commodity traded in the spot market and whose supply purchase is affected by price and demand uncertainty. A firm aims at meeting a random demand of the commodity at a random time by maximizing total expected profits. We model the firm's optimal procurement problem as a singular stochastic control problem in which controls are non-decreasing processes and represent the cumulative investment made by the firm in the spot market (a so-called stochastic 'monotone follower problem'). We assume a general exponential Levy process for the commodity's spot price, rather than the commonly used geometric Brownian motion, and general convex holding costs.
   We obtain necessary and sufficient first order conditions for optimality and we provide the optimal procurement policy in terms of a base inventory process; that is, a minimal time-dependent desirable inventory level that the firm's manager must reach at any time. In particular, in the case of linear holding costs and exponentially distributed demand, we are also able to obtain the explicit analytic form of the optimal policy and a probabilistic representation of the optimal revenue. The paper is completed by some computer drawings of the optimal inventory when spot prices are given by a geometric Brownian motion and by an exponential jump-diffusion process. In the first case we also make a numerical comparison between the value function and the revenue associated to the classical static "newsvendor" strategy.

ID SIMULATION; UNCERTAINTY
AB Two standard approaches to predicting the expected values of simulation outputs are either execution of the simulation itself or the use of a metamodel. In this work we propose a methodology that enables both approaches to be combined. When a prediction for a new input is required the procedure is to augment the metamodel forecast with additional simulation outputs for a given input. The key benefit of the method is that it is possible to reach the desired prediction accuracy at a new input faster than in the case when no initial metamodel is present. We show that such a procedure is computationally simple and can be applied to, for instance, web-based simulations, where response time to user actions is often crucial.
   In this analysis we focus on stochastic kriging metamodels. We show that if this type of metamodel is used and we assume that its metaparameters are fixed, then updating such a metamodel with new observations is equivalent to a Bayesian forecast combination under the known variance assumption. Additionally we observe that using metamodel predictions of variance instead of point estimates for estimation of stochastic kriging metamodes can lead to improved metamodel performance.

A goal programming model for incomplete interval multiplicative preference relations and its application in group decision-making. European Journal of Operational Research 218, 747-754], two equations are introduced to define consistency of incomplete interval multiplicative preference relations (IMPRs) and employed to develop a goal programming model for estimating missing values. This note illustrates that such consistency definition and estimation model are technically incorrect. New transitivity conditions are proposed to define consistent IMPRs, and a two-stage goal programming approach is devised to estimate missing values for incomplete IMPRs.

ID PROGRAMMING FORMULATION; PORTFOLIO OPTIMIZATION
AB Though value-at-risk (VaR) has been widely applied by finance industry, a possibility of multiple optimums that is caused by the nonlinearity in modeling can challenge its application. To deal with this technical issue, we propose a linearized VaR model that employs the mixed 0-1 programing in Lin (2009) P4 model. We further advance the previous models with considering various transaction costs and the optimization of short-selling weights. We compare the performance of buy-and-hold (BH) strategy, the mean-variance (MV) model, the original P4 model, and our linearized P4 (LP4) model by rebalancing a wide scale of international and alternative investments during a period between 2001 and 2012. The results of numerical tests show the superior performance of the VaR models to the BH and the MV portfolios. The LP4 model yields the global optimum and outperforms the corresponding P4 model in both return and risk. The stability of portfolio value generated from the LP4 model supports its higher effectiveness in risk management than the P4 model.

AB In this paper, the resource allocation problem in multi-class dynamic PERT networks with finite capacity of concurrent projects (COnstant Number of Projects In Process (CONPIP)) is studied. The dynamic PERT network is modeled as a queuing network, where new projects from different classes (types) are generated according to independent Poisson processes with different rates over the time horizon. Each activity of a project is performed at a devoted service station with one server located in a node of the network, whereas activity durations for different classes in each service station are independent and exponentially distributed random variables with different service rates. Indeed, the projects from different classes may be different in their precedence networks and also the durations of the activities. For modeling the multi-class dynamic PERT networks with CONPIP, we first consider every class separately and convert the queueing network of every class into a proper stochastic network. Then, by constructing a proper finite-state continuous-time Markov model, a system of differential equations is created to compute the project completion time distribution for any particular project. The problem is formulated as a multi-objective model with three objectives to optimally control the resources allocated to the service stations. Finally, we develop a simulated annealing (SA) algorithm to solve this multi-objective problem, using the goal attainment formulation. We also compare the SA results against the results of a discrete-time approximation of the original optimal control problem, to show the effectiveness of the proposed solution technique.

AB The investigated problem is the analysis of customers' strategic behavior in a single server Markovian M-2/M/1 queue with batch arrivals of two customers with a reward-cost structure. At their arrival time, customers can decide to join the queue or to balk. The utility of each one depends on his decision, on his partner's decision and on the system state. Two cases are considered: when the system provides the information about its state (observable case), and when this information is not provided (unobservable case). Both problems are modeled as games in extensive form with complete and imperfect information. We give the Nash equilibria for each corresponding game and we compare between both cases in order to determine the policy which arranges the system's manager.

AB Dynamic pricing of commodities without knowing the exact relation between price and demand is a muchstudied problem. Most existing studies assume that the parameters describing the market are constant during the selling period. This severely reduces their practical applicability, since, in reality, market characteristics may change all the time, without the firm always being aware of it. In the present paper we study dynamic pricing and learning in a changing market environment. We introduce a methodology that enables the price manager to hedge against changes in the market, and provide explicit upper bounds on the regret - a measure of the performance of the firm's pricing decisions. In addition, this methodology guides the selection of the optimal way to estimate the market process. We provide numerical examples from practically relevant situations to illustrate the methodology.

AB The tactical berth allocation problem (BAP) concerns the allocation of favorite berthing positions to ships that periodically call at the terminals. This paper investigates the tactical-level berth allocation scheduling models. First a deterministic model for tactical BAP is formulated with considering the periodicity of schedule. However, in reality, the number of containers that need to be handled (discharging & loading) for each ship is uncertain in the ship's future periods. Thus for the tactical BAP, there is significant uncertainty with respect to the operation time (dwell time) of ships, which further complicates the traditional berth allocation decisions. From stochastic perspective, this paper proposes both a stochastic programming formulation that can cope with arbitrary probability distributions of ships' operation time deviation, and a robust formulation that is applicable to situations in which limited information about probability distributions is available. The relationship between the two models is also investigated in an analytic way. Some meta-heuristic algorithms are suggested for solving the models. Numerical experiments are performed to validate the effectiveness of the proposed models and the efficiency of the proposed solution algorithms. The experiments also compare the above stochastic programming formulation and the robust formulation models, as well as evaluate their potential benefits in practice. This study finds that the robust method can derive a near optimal solution to the stochastic model in a fast way, and also has the benefit of limiting the worst-case outcome of the tactical BAP decisions.

AB In onshore oilfields, several sucker-rod pumps are deployed over a large geographic area to lift oil from the bottom of production wells. Powered by electric rotary machines, the rod pumps operate according to cyclic control policies that alternate between on and off pumping periods which are designed to drive maximum production. This cyclic behavior gives rise to the problem of scheduling pumpoff operations in order to minimize the system power peak and thereby smoothen the power-consumption profile. To this end, this paper develops MILP formulations for the coordination of control policies and their reconfiguration during operations. Following a column-based approach or using integer variables to model the power-consumption profile, the resulting MILP formulations are put to the test in a host of synthetic, but representative oilfields.

AB Six Sigma is a widely used method to improve processes from various industry sectors. The target failure rate for Six Sigma projects is 3.4 parts per million or 2 parts per billion. In this paper, we show that when a process is exponential, attaining such performances may require a larger reduction in variation (i.e., greater quality-improvement effort). In addition, identifying whether the process data are of non-normal distribution is important to more accurately estimate the effort required to improve the process. A key finding of this study is that, for a low ko- level, the amount of variation reduction required to improve an exponentially distributed process is less than that of a normally distributed process. On the other hand, for a higher k sigma level, the reverse scenario is the case. This study also analyzes processes following Gamma and Weibull distributions, and the results further support our concern that simply reporting the Sigma level as an indication of the quality of a product or process can be misleading. Two optimization models are developed to illustrate the effect of underestimating the quality-improvement effort on the optimal solution to minimize cost. In conclusion, the classical and widely used assumption of a normally distributed process may lead to implementation of quality-improvement strategies or the selection of Six Sigma projects that are based on erroneous solutions.

AB In the context of Justus von Liebig's Law of the Minimum, this study assesses the impacts that trade barriers have on trade resistance between United States (U.S.) manufacturing industries and their trade partners. An undesirable trade resistance model is presented, where trade barriers are (undesirable) inputs into the production of the (undesirable) output, trade resistance. It is then presented how Johansen's notion of Capacity is utilized to assess trade barriers' impacts. Estimation takes place by employing Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA). Results suggest that U.S. trade partners' port logistics are the most limiting trade barrier for the U.S. manufacturing industries, followed by the distance between the U.S. and its trade partners, the tariff imposed by the U.S., and the tariff imposed by the trading partner.

AB In this paper we study two reverse auction formats in a single period setting, the sealed pay-as-bid and the open format, when suppliers are capacity constrained. In the pay-as-bid format we characterize the asymmetric bidding equilibrium for the case of two suppliers with uniformly distributed cost. We find that the pay-as-bid auction allocates business inefficiently and that a supplier's bid is nonincreasing in the opponent's capacity and is typically decreasing in its own capacity. We then characterize a descending price-clock open auction implementation and find that it is optimal and that the buyer's expected cost decreases as capacity is more evenly spread. Finally, we find that the pay-as-bid auction results in a higher expected cost to the buyer as compared to the open auction.

AB In this paper a definition of industry inefficiency in cost constrained production environments is introduced. This definition uses the indirect directional distance function and quantifies the inefficiency of the industry in terms of the overall output loss, given the industry cost budget. The industry inefficiency indicator is then decomposed into sources components: reallocation inefficiency arising from sub-optimal configuration of the industry; firm inefficiency arising from a failure to select optimal input quantities (given the prevalent inputs prices); firm inefficiency due to lack of best practices. The method is illustrated using data on Ontario electricity distributors. These data show that lack of best practices is only a minor component of the overall inefficiency of the industry (less than 10 percent), with reallocation inefficiency accounting for more than 75 percent of the overall inefficiency of the system. An analysis based on counter-factual input prices is conducted in order to illustrate how the model can be used to estimate the effects of a change in the regulation regime.

AB Eco-innovation is recognized as a determinant of success or failure of environmental protection efforts in the long run. This paper attempts to examine China's eco-innovation gains in response to the energy saving and emissions reduction (ESER) policy enforced during 2006-2010. We first construct an integrated analysis framework to evaluate the changes of energy and environmental performance used as the proxy of eco-innovation, and then the intertemporal change of China's eco-innovation gains as well as the regional differences is investigated. The results indicate that China had accelerated its process of eco-innovations during 2006-2010 when a series of ESER policies were enforced. The developments and wide adoptions of advanced energy saving and environmentally friendly technologies serve as the primary driving forces, while upgrading management skills and organizational designs contribute relatively little. Furthermore, the realizing paths of cross-region eco-innovations in China are obviously discrepant.

AB In this paper we model the multi-level uncapacitated facility location problem as two different combinatorial optimization problems. The first model is the classical representation of the problem which uses a set of vertices as combinatorial objects to represent solutions whereas in the second model we propose the use of a set of paths. An interesting observation is that the real-valued set function associated with the first combinatorial problem does not satisfy the submodular property, whereas the set function associated with the second problem does satisfy this property. This illustrates the fact that submodularity is not a property intrinsic to an optimization problem but rather to its mathematical representation.

AB Recently Georgiev, Luc, and Pardalos (2013), [Robust aspects of solutions in deterministic multiple objective linear programming, European Journal of Operational Research, 229(1), 29-36] introduced the notion of robust efficient solutions for linear multi-objective optimization problems. In this paper, we extend this notion to nonlinear case. It is shown that, under the compactness of the feasible set or convexity, each robust efficient solution is a proper efficient solution. Some necessary and sufficient conditions for robustness, with respect to the tangent cone and the non-ascent directions, are proved. An optimization problem for calculating a robustness radius followed by a comparison between the newly-defined robustness notion and two existing ones is presented. Moreover, some alterations of objective functions preserving weak/proper/robust efficiency are studied.

AB We consider an online matching problem with concave returns. This problem is a generalization of the traditional online matching problem and has vast applications in online advertising. In this work, we propose a dynamic learning algorithm that achieves near-optimal performance for this problem when the inputs arrive in a random order and satisfy certain conditions. The key idea of our algorithm is to learn the input data pattern dynamically: we solve a sequence of carefully chosen partial allocation problems and use their optimal solutions to assist with the future decisions. Our analysis belongs to the primal-dual paradigm; however, the absence of linearity of the objective function and the dynamic feature of the algorithm makes our analysis quite unique. We also show through numerical experiments that our algorithm performs well for test data.

AB More and more companies in the routing industry are providing consistent service to gain competitive advantage. However, improved service consistency comes at the price of higher routing cost, i.e., routing cost and service consistency are conflicting objectives. In this paper, we extend the generalized consistent vehicle routing problem (GenConVRP) by considering several objective functions: improving driver consistency and arrival time consistency, and minimizing routing cost are independent objectives of the problem. We refer to the problem as the multi-objective generalized consistent vehicle routing problem (MOGenConVRP). A multi-objective optimization approach enables a thorough trade-off analysis between the conflicting objective functions. The results of this paper should help companies in finding adequate consistency goals to aim for. Results are generated for several test instances by two exact solution approaches and one heuristic. The exact approaches are based on the E-constraint framework and are used to solve small test instances to optimality. Large instances with up to 199 customers and a planning horizon of 5 days are solved by multi directional large neighborhood search (MDLNS) that combines the multi directional local search framework and the LNS for the GenConVRP. The solution quality of the heuristic is evaluated by examining five multi-objective quality indicators. We find that MDLNS is an eligible solution approach for performing a meaningful trade-off analysis.
   Our analysis shows that a 70 percent better arrival time consistency is achieved by increasing travel cost by not more than 3.84 percent, on average; visiting each customer by the same driver each time is significantly more expensive than allowing at least two different drivers per customer; in many cases, arrival time consistency and driver consistency can be improved simultaneously.

ID UNIT COMMITMENT; POWER
AB To a large extent, electricity markets worldwide still rely on deterministic procedures for clearing energy and reserve auctions. However, increasing shares of the production mix consist of renewable sources whose nature is stochastic and non-dispatchable, as their output is uncertain and cannot be controlled by the operators of the production units. Stochastic programming models allow the joint determination of the day-ahead energy and reserve dispatch accounting for the uncertainty in the output from these sources. However, the size of these models gets quickly out of hand as a large number of scenarios are needed to properly represent the uncertainty. In this work, we take an alternative approach and cast the problem as an adaptive robust optimization problem. The resulting day-ahead energy and reserve schedules yield the minimum system cost, accounting for the cost of the redispatch decisions at the balancing (real-time) stage, in the worst-case realization of the stochastic production within a specified uncertainty set. We propose a novel reformulation of the problem that allows considering general polyhedral uncertainty sets. In a case-study, we show that, in comparison to a risk-averse stochastic programming model, the robust optimization approach progressively trades off optimality in expectation with improved performance in terms of risk. These differences, however, gradually taper off as the level of risk-aversion increases for the stochastic programming approach. Computational studies show that the robust optimization model scales well with the size of the power system, which is promising in view of real-world applications of this approach.

AB It is an important issue to model the dynamic biological networks from their time-course response datasets, which is critical to understand the system behaviors. This task includes two sub-tasks: network structure identification and associated parameters estimation. In most existing methods, the two sub-tasks are dealt with step by step, which may result in inconsistence between them and hence inaccuracy of the final model. Another challenge is how to transparently understand the derived model, which cannot be achieved by the traditional black-box methods. A human readable fuzzy rule-based model, denoted as MoPath, is developed for the identification of both structure topology and associated parameters, simultaneously, of a biological network within an optimization framework. MoPath encodes the fuzzy rules into particles of heterogeneous particle swarm optimization (CHPSO) algorithm to generate the optimal model. Theoretically, we demonstrate that the cooperation in CHPSO can maintain a balance between exploration and exploitation to guarantee the particles converge to stable points, which is greatly helpful for finding the optimal model consisting of both the network topology and parameters. We demonstrate MoPath on two dynamic biological networks, and successfully generate a few human readable rules that can well represent the network with high accuracy and good robustness.

AB In this paper we tackle the problem of co-ordinating transmission of data across a Wireless Mesh Network. The single task nature of mesh nodes imposes simultaneous activation of adjacent nodes during transmission. This makes the co-ordinated scheduling of local mesh node traffic with forwarded traffic across the access network to the Internet via the Gateway notoriously difficult. Moreover, with packet data the nature of the co-ordinated transmission schedule has a big impact upon both the data throughput and energy consumption. Perfect Periodic Scheduling, in which each demand is itself serviced periodically, provides a robust solution. In this paper we explore the properties of Perfect Periodic Schedules with modulo arithmetic using the Chinese Remainder Theorem. We provide a polynomial time, optimisation algorithm, when the access network routing tree has a chain or binary tree structure. Results demonstrate that energy savings and high throughput can be achieved simultaneously. The methodology is generalisable. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF OPERATIONAL RESEARCH

DT Article
DE Combinatorial optimization; Constraints satisfaction; Linear
   programming; OR in health services; Models comparison
ID ROOM; TEAMWORK
AB The daily scheduling of an operating theatre is a highly constrained problem. In addition to standard scheduling constraints, many additional constraints on human and material resources encountered in real life should be taken into account. These constraints concern the priority of operations, the affinities between surgical team members, renewable and non-renewable resources, various sizes in the block scheduling strategy, and the surgical team's preferences/availabilities. We developed two models in our research work, using mixed-integer and constraint programming respectively. These were compared using a real-life case in order to determine which one coped better with a highly constrained problem. A cross-comparison of the experimental results shows that the mixed-integer programming model provides a better performance using the weighted sum objective function than using the makespan minimization objective function. Conversely, the constraint programming model is better suited to the makespan minimization objective function than to the weighted sum objective function. The originality of this research lies on three levels: (1) two models are presented in detail and compared using real data; (2) constraint programming is used to schedule the operating theatre; (3) some new constraints are taken into account, such as the affinities between team members in the composition of surgical teams, and the priorities of patients such as diabetics.

ID TABU SEARCH; GENETIC ALGORITHM; FLOWSHOP
AB An extended version of the flexible job shop problem is tackled in this work. The considered extension to the classical flexible job shop problem allows the precedences between the operations to be given by an arbitrary directed acyclic graph instead of a linear order. Therefore, the problem consists of allocating the operations to the machines and sequencing them in compliance with the given precedences. The goal in the present work is the minimization of the makespan. A list scheduling algorithm is introduced and its natural extension to a beam search method is proposed. Numerical experiments assess the efficiency of the proposed approaches.

ID CONDITION-BASED MAINTENANCE; MODEL; OPTIMIZATION; FAILURE; PREDICTION;

AB Condition monitoring (CM) and manual inspection are increasingly used in industry to identify a system's state so that necessary preventive maintenance (PM) decisions can be made. In this paper, we present a model that considers a single-unit system subject to both CM and additional manual inspections. There are two preset control limits: an inspection threshold and a preventive replacement (PR) threshold. When a CM measurement is equal to or greater than the inspection threshold but is less than the PR threshold, a manual inspection activity is initiated. When a CM measurement is greater than the PR threshold, a PR activity should be carried out. The system's degradation process evolves according to a two-stage failure process: the normal working stage, which is from new to the initial point that a defect occurs, with the CM measurement coming from a stochastic process; and the delay-time stage, which is from the initial point that a defect occurs until the point of failure, with the CM measurement coming from an increasing stochastic process. We assume that a manual inspection is perfect in that it can always identify which of these two stages the system is in. In our study, the decision variables are the CM interval and the inspection threshold, and we aim to minimize the expected cost per unit time. We provide a numerical example to demonstrate the applicability and solution procedure of the model.

AB This research is motivated by the capacity allocation problem at a major provider of customized products to the oil and gas drilling industry. We formulate a finite-horizon, discrete-time, dynamic programming model in which a firm decides how to reserve capacity for emergency demand and how to prioritize two classes of regular demand. While regular demand can be backlogged, emergency demand will be lost if not fulfilled within the period of its arrival. Since backlogging cost accumulates over time, we find it optimal for the firm to adopt a dynamic prioritization policy that evaluates the priorities of different classes of regular demand every period. The optimal prioritization involves metrics that measure backlogging losses from various perspectives. We fully characterize the firm's optimal prioritization and reservation policy. Those characterizations shed light on managerial insights.

AB The Permutation Flow Shop Scheduling Problem (PFSP) is a complex combinatorial optimization problem. PFSP has been widely studied as a static problem using heuristics and metaheuristics. In reality, PFSPs are not usually static, but are rather dynamic, as customer orders are placed at random time intervals. In the dynamic problem, two tasks must be considered: (i) should a new order be accepted? and (ii) if accepted, how can this schedule be ordered, when some orders may be already under process and or be in the queue for processing? For the first task, we propose a simple heuristic based decision process, and for the second task, we developed a Genetic Algorithm (GA) based approach that is applied repeatedly for re-optimization as each new order arrives. The usefulness of the proposed approach has been demonstrated by solving a set of test problems. In addition the proposed approach, along with a simulation model, has been tested for maximizing the revenue of a flow shop production business under different order arrival scenarios. Finally, a case study is presented to show the applicability of the proposed approach in practice.

AB We construct a theoretical model to study the competition of call centers in the call center service supply chain. The market we study consists of multiple competing call centers and many clients searching for outsourcing partners to answer their customers' phone calls. Through the perspective of operational efficiency, we create a single index that aggregates several contract parameters. The index can be used to segment the call center market as well as to estimate the contract prices at equilibrium. The results can help the call centers to locate and focus on their market niches. Clients can use the results to estimate the cost of their contracts and negotiate with the call centers for better deals. The results can also be used to explain the observed reshoring phenomenon in recent years from the perspective of operations management. In particular, our results suggest that call centers in low-wage locations have a competitive advantage on large contracts with very strict waiting time requirements. On the other hand, call centers in high-wage locations may still be attractive for contracts that have lower call volumes, shorter contract lengths, and/or less strict waiting time requirements. Finally, we present field studies from an international service provider with call centers in multiple locations. The results of the field studies suggest a strong match between our theoretical results and the empirical evidence.

DE Routing; Electric vehicle system; Maximum throughput; Perturbed lyapunov

ID ALGORITHMS; CONSTRAINTS; COSTS
AB There is increased interest in deploying charging station infrastructure for electric vehicles, due to the increasing adoption of such vehicles to reduce emissions. However, there are a number of key challenges for providing high quality of service to such vehicles, stemming from technological reasons. One of them is due to the relative slow charging times and the other is due to the relative limited battery range. Hence, developing efficient routing strategies of electric vehicles requesting charging to stations that have available charging resources is an important component of the infrastructure. In this work, we propose a queueing modeling framework for the problem at hand and develop such routing strategies that optimise a performance metric related to vehicles' sojourn time in the system. By incorporating appropriate weights into the well-known dynamic routing discipline "join-the-Shortest-Queue", we show that the proposed routing strategies not only do they maximise the queueing system's throughput, but also significantly mitigate the vehicle's sojourn time. The strategies are also adaptive in nature and responsive to changes in the speed of charging at the stations, the distribution of the vehicles' point of origin when requesting service, the traffic congestion level and the vehicle speed; all the above are novel aspects and compatible with the requirements of a modern electric vehicle charging infrastructure.

AB This paper discusses univariate density estimation in situations when the sample (hard information) is supplemented by "soft" information about the random phenomenon. These situations arise broadly in operations research and management science where practical and computational reasons severely limit the sample size, but problem structure and past experiences could be brought in. In particular, density estimation is needed for generation of input densities to simulation and stochastic optimization models, in analysis of simulation output, and when instantiating probability models. We adopt a constrained maximum likelihood estimator that incorporates any, possibly random, soft information through an arbitrary collection of constraints. We illustrate the breadth of possibilities by discussing soft information about shape, support, continuity, smoothness, slope, location of modes, symmetry, density values, neighborhood of known density, moments, and distribution functions. The maximization takes place over spaces of extended real-valued semicontinuous functions and therefore allows us to consider essentially any conceivable density as well as convenient exponential transformations. The infinite dimensionality of the optimization problem is overcome by approximating splines tailored to these spaces. To facilitate the treatment of small samples, the construction of these splines is decoupled from the sample. We discuss existence and uniqueness of the estimator, examine consistency under increasing hard and soft information, and give rates of convergence. Numerical examples illustrate the value of soft information, the ability to generate a family of diverse densities, and the effect of misspecification of soft information. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB We consider the problem of allocating indivisible goods to agents who have preferences over the goods. In such a setting, a central task is to maximize social welfare. In this paper, we assume the preferences to be additive and measure social welfare by means of the Nash product. We focus on the computational complexity involved in maximizing Nash product social welfare when scores inherent in classical voting procedures such as approval or Borda voting are used to associate utilities with the agents' preferences. In particular, we show that the maximum Nash product social welfare can be computed efficiently when approval scores are used, while for Borda and lexicographic scores the corresponding decision problem becomes NP-complete.

AB In this article, we provide a new methodology for optimizing a portfolio of wind farms within a market environment, for two Market Designs (exogenous prices and endogenous prices). Our model is built on an agent based representation of suppliers and generators interacting in a certain number of geographic demand markets, organized as two tiered systems. Assuming rational expectation of the agents with respect to the outcome of the real-time market, suppliers take forward positions, which act as signals in the day-ahead market, to compensate for the uncertainty associated with supply and demand. Then, generators optimize their bilateral trades with the generators in the other markets. The Nash Equilibria resulting from this Signaling Game are characterized using Game Theory. The Markowitz Frontier, containing the set of efficient wind farm portfolios, is derived theoretically as a function of the number of wind farms and of their concentration. Finally, using a case study of France, Germany and Belgium, we simulate the Markowitz Frontier contour in the expected cost-risk plane.

AB The single-product, single-period newsvendor problem with two decision variables, namely price and stock quantity, is considered. The performance measure, in addition to the expected revenue, includes the variance of the income scaled with a risk parameter. We present conditions for the concavity of this risk-sensitive performance measure and the uniqueness of the optimal solution for both risk-averse and risk-seeking cases under the additive demand model, and compare the results to others previously published. These conditions are introduced in terms of the lost sales rate elasticity. Furthermore, we provide numerical examples that aim to endorse the theoretical results herein explained.

DE Capacity management; Time based competition; Uniform lead-time
ID PRICE; PERFORMANCE; COMPETITION
AB In today's competitive business environment, quick service with minimal waiting time is an important factor for customers when choosing a service. Many service organizations guarantee a uniform lead-time to all customers in order to gain competitive advantages in the market. In selecting a lead-time to quote, the firm has to take into consideration not only how customers will react to the delivery time guarantee, but also whether it has adequate capacity to fulfill the commitment. A short lead-time can bring both benefits and costs. It can increase customer demand, but might require a higher capacity level. We present a mathematical model and a solution method for determining the optimal quoted lead-time and capacity level for a profit-maximizing firm with time-varying and lead-time sensitive demand. The firm incurs convex capacity costs and pays lateness penalties whenever the actual lead-time exceeds the quoted lead-time. A few studies have been conducted on the relationship between uniform lead-time, capacity, demand, and overall profitability. However, none of them takes the time variation of demand into account. Our work differs from previous research in that we explicitly model such a demand pattern.

AB In many managerial situations it is important to consider both risk and reward simultaneously. This is a challenging task using standard techniques that are applied for solving sequential stochastic optimization problems since these techniques are designed to consider only one objective at a time either maximizing reward or minimizing risk. In applications such as operational decisions for start-ups, this can be particularly restricting, since managers need to make trade-offs between profitability driven growth and the risk of bankruptcy. We extend in several ways prior work that has addressed the inventory issue for start-ups to minimize the risk of bankruptcy. The primary contribution of this paper is to present a novel approach to track mean as well as variance of a set of policies in a dynamic stochastic programming model and using the mean-variance solutions in a simple heuristic for creating efficient risk-reward frontiers. This is a challenging task from an implementation standpoint, since this requires carrying information on both risk and reward simultaneously for each state, which standard stochastic programming solution methods are not designed to do. We also illustrate the use of our methodology in a richer model of start-up operations where, in addition to inventory issues, advertising decisions are also considered.

AB To date, comparative statics effects analyzed in the context of expected utility depend on the decision-maker's utility function. This paper presents a methodology that allows comparative statics effects to be obtained independent of the utility function for a general family of problems. In other words, we provide a set of conditions under which all decision-makers act the same way. Such a methodology can be applied to relevant problems in the related literature, such as the portfolio choice and the competitive firm under price uncertainty (with or without the existence of a forward/futures market). With regards to such specific cases, we show and analyze the most relevant effects produced by the variation of two or more parameters, regardless of the decision-maker's preferences and attitude towards risk. Some of these effects are illustrated numerically.

ID OBSERVABILITY PROBLEM; TRAFFIC NETWORKS; MATRIX; INFERENCE
AB We address an important problem in the context of traffic management and control related to the optimum location of vehicle-ID sensors on the links of a network to derive route flow volumes. We consider both the full observability version of the problem, where one seeks for the minimum number of sensors (or minimum cost) such that all the route flow volumes can be derived, and the estimation version of the problem, that arises when there is a limited budget in the location of sensors. Four mathematical formulations are presented. These formulations improve the existing ones in the literature since they better define the feasible region of the problem by taking into account the temporal dimension of the license plate scanning process. The resulting mathematical formulations are solved to optimality and compared with the existing mathematical formulations. The results show that new and better solutions can be achieved with less computational effort. We also present two heuristic approaches: a greedy algorithm and a tabu search algorithm that are able to efficiently solve the analyzed problems and they are a useful tool able to find a very good trade-off between quality of the solution and computational time.

ID SENSITIVITY; SURVIVAL; STAGE; WOMEN; MODEL
AB Mammography is known to be the most effective way of breast cancer detection. The efficacy of mammography screening guidelines is highly associated with women's compliance with these recommendations. Currently, none of the existing policies takes women's behavior into consideration; instead, perfect adherence is assumed. However, an earlier longitudinal data analysis has revealed that women's compliance with mammography guidelines remained low in recent years. In this study, we develop a randomized discrete-time finite-horizon partially observable Markov chain model to evaluate a wide range of screening mammography policies, incorporating heterogeneity in women's adherence behaviors. Considering potential harms of mammography tests (e.g., risk of developing radiation-induced breast cancer, false negatives, false positives, etc.), policies with varying starting age, ending age and frequency of screening mammograms at different ages are compared in terms of total quality adjusted life years (QALYs) and lifetime breast cancer mortality risk. Our results show that women with perfect adherence do not always experience higher QALYs. In fact, for some policies, including the American Cancer Society (ACS) policy, the general population with various adherence levels has higher QALYs than women with perfect adherence. However, in terms of lifetime breast cancer mortality risk, higher/perfect adherence always results in lower risk of dying from breast cancer. This implies that the benefits of mammography in decreasing death from breast cancer outweigh the increased risk of developing radiation-induced breast cancer from mammographic screening. This study can facilitate healthcare providers to tailor screening mammography recommendations based on their patients' estimated adherence levels.

DE OR in sports; Football; Two-legged matches; Home advantage
AB The most important pan-European football tournaments include ties where two clubs play each other over two matches and the aggregate score determines which is admitted to the next stage of the competition. A number of stakeholders may be interested in assessing the chances of progression for either of the clubs once the score of the first match (leg) is known. The paper asks what would be a "good" result for a team in the first leg. Employing data from 6,975 contests, modelling reveals that what constitutes a good result has changed substantially over time. Generally, clubs which play at home in the first leg have become more likely to convert any given first-leg result to eventual success. Taking this trend into account, and controlling for team and country strength, a probit model is presented for use in generating probability estimates for which team will progress conditional on the first-leg scoreline. Illustrative results relate to ties where two average teams play each other and to ties where a relatively weak club plays home-first against a relatively strong club. Given that away goals serve as a tie-breaker should aggregate scores be equal after the two matches, the results also quantify how great the damage is when a home-first club concedes an away goal.

AB A District Cooling System (DCS) is an interconnected system encompassing a centralized chiller plant, a Thermal Energy Storage (TES) unit, a piping network, and clusters of consumers' buildings. The main function of a DCS is to produce and deliver chilled water to satisfy the cooling demand of a scattered set of buildings. DCSs are recognized to be highly energy efficient, and therefore constitute an environment-friendly alternative to the traditional power-driven air conditioning systems being operated at individual buildings. In this paper, we investigate the optimal design and operation of a DCS so that the total investment and operational costs are minimized. This involves optimizing decisions related to chiller plant capacity, storage tank capacity, piping network size and layout, and quantities to be produced and stored during every period of time. To this end, mixed-integer programming (MIP) models, that explicitly capture the structural aspects as well as both pressure- and temperature-related requirements, are developed and tested. The results of computational experiments that demonstrate the practical effectiveness of the proposed models are also presented.

AB As supply chain risk management has transitioned from an emerging topic to a growing research area, there is a need to classify different types of research and examine the general trends of this research area. This helps identify fertile research streams with great potential for further examination. This paper presents a systematic review of the quantitative and analytical models (i.e. mathematical, optimization and simulation modeling efforts) for managing supply chain risks. We use bibliometric and network analysis tools to generate insights that have not been captured in the previous reviews on the topic. In particular, we complete a systemic mapping of the literature that identifies the key research clusters/topics, interrelationships, and generative research areas that have provided the field with the foundational knowledge, concepts, theories, tools, and techniques. Some of our findings include (1) quantitative analysis of supply chain risk is expanding rapidly; (2) European journals are the more popular research outlets for the dissemination of the knowledge developed by researchers in United States and Asia; and (3) sustainability risk analysis is an emerging and fast evolving research topic.

AB Many years have passed since Baesens et al. published their benchmarking study of classification algorithms in credit scoring [Baesens, B., Van Gestel, T., Viaene, S., Stepanova, M., Suykens, J., & Vanthienen, J. (2003). Benchmarking state-of-the-art classification algorithms for credit scoring.journal of the Operational Research Society, 54(6), 627-635.]. The interest in prediction methods for scorecard development is unbroken. However, there have been several advancements including novel learning methods, performance measures and techniques to reliably compare different classifiers, which the credit scoring literature does not reflect. To close these research gaps, we update the study of Baesens et al. and compare several novel classification algorithms to the state-of-the-art in credit scoring. In addition, we examine the extent to which the assessment of alternative scorecards differs across established and novel indicators of predictive accuracy. Finally, we explore whether more accurate classifiers are managerial meaningful. Our study provides valuable insight for professionals and academics in credit scoring. It helps practitioners to stay abreast of technical advancements in predictive modeling. From an academic point of view, the study provides an independent assessment of recent scoring methods and offers a new baseline to which future approaches can be compared.

AB In this article, we consider the T-2 control chart for bivariate samples of size n with observations that are not only cross-correlated but also autocorrelated. The cross covariance matrix of the sample mean vectors is derived with the assumption that the observations are described by a multivariate first order autoregressive model - VAR (1). The combined effect of the correlation and autocorrelation on the performance of the T-2 chart is also investigated. Earlier studies proved that changes in only one variable are detected faster when the variables are correlated. This result extends to the case that one or both variables are also autocorrelated.

SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF OPERATIONAL RESEARCH

DE Metaheuristics; OR in natural resources; Mining complex; Stochastic
   orebody simulations; Operating alternatives
AB Mining complexes contain multiple sequential activities that are strongly interrelated. Extracting the material from different sources may be seen as the first main activity, and any change in the sequence of extraction of the mining blocks modify the activities downstream, including blending, processing and transporting the processed material to final stocks or ports. Similarly, modifying the conditions of operation at a given processing path or the transportation systems implemented may affect the suitability of using a mining sequence previously optimized. This paper presents a method to generate mining, processing and transportation schedules that account for the previously mentioned activities (or stages) associated with the mining complex simultaneously. The method uses an initial solution generated using conventional optimizers and improves it by mean of perturbations associated to three different levels of decision: block based perturbations, operating alternative based perturbations and transportation system based perturbation. The method accounts for geological uncertainty of several deposits by considering scenarios originated from combinations of their respective stochastic orebody simulations. The implementation of the method in a multipit copper operation shows its ability to reduce deviations from capacity and blending targets while improving the expected NPV (cumulative discounted cash flows), which highlight the importance of stochastic optimizers given their ability to generate more value with less risk.

AB The purpose of this research is to help manufacturing companies identify the key performance evaluation criteria for achieving customer satisfaction through Balanced Scorecard (BSC) and Multiple Criteria Decision Malcing (MCDM) approaches. To explore the causal relationships among the four dimensions of business performance in Balanced Scorecard as well as their key performance criteria, a MCDM approach combining DEIVIATEL and ANP techniques is adopted. Subsequently, the MCDM framework is tested using Delphi method and a questionnaire survey is conducted in 24 manufacturing firms from Taiwan, Vietnam and Thailand.
   The research findings indicate that manufacturing companies should focus more on improving customer perspectives such as customer satisfaction and customer loyalty by integrating products and services innovation and providing diversified value-added product-service offerings as well as developing close long-term partnership with customers. In addition, the classification of importance and improvability into four strategic planning zones provide practicing managers with a decision making tool for prioritizing continuous improvement projects and effectively allocating their resources to those key criteria identified in the strategic map for business performance improvement.
   By identifying critical criteria and their interrelationships, our research results can help manufacturing companies enhance their business performance in both financial and non-financial perspectives. They can also serve as valuable guidelines and references for manufacturing companies to achieve better customer satisfaction through sustainable product-service system practices.

AB Innovative approaches to the assessment and management of medical technologies use a combination of health technology assessment (HTA) and operations research methods, specifically multiple-criteria decision analysis (MCDA). The purpose of this article is to develop methodological support and provide a theoretical justification for decision support in the selection of medical devices under conditions of uncertainty, using MRI systems as an example. The goal of the method application has been formulated as follows: determine a ranked list of MRI systems for contributory health organisations administered by regional authorities (regional hospitals) in the Czech Republic. An analytic hierarchy process (AHP) and the Delphi method were used to identify experts' preferences and for consensus building. The expert group was selected based on eight complex-valued criteria, and each expert was given a weighting factor. A set of 13 MRI systems and the 14 key default specifications that play the most important roles when hospitals select MRIs for purchase were defined. Strong conformity (W >= 0.6, p < 0.05) within the experts' judgments was revealed. A prediction regarding alternatives, weights and changes in priority vectors over the,following 8 years has been provided. The developed approach is useful in decision support when selecting medical devices under conditions of uncertainty by hospitals.

AB This paper introduces and studies the minimum edge blocker dominating set problem (EBDP), which is formulated as follows. Given a vertex-weighted undirected graph and r> 0, remove a minimum number of edges so that the weight of any dominating set in the remaining graph is at least r. Dominating sets are used in a wide variety of graph-based applications such as the analysis of wireless and social networks. We show that the decision version of EBDP is NP-hard for any fixed r> 0. We present an analytical lower bound for the value of an optimal solution to EBDP and formulate this problem as a linear 0-1 program with a large number of constraints. We also study the convex hull of feasible solutions to EBDP and identify facet-inducing inequalities for this polytope. Furthermore, we develop the first exact algorithm for solving EBDP, which solves the proposed formulation by a branch-and-cut approach where nontrivial constraints are applied in a lazy fashion. Finally, we also provide the computational results obtained by using our approach on a test-bed of randomly generated instances and real-life power-law graphs.

Based on the MCNFP model, all available benchmark instances of the MCPRP can be solved to optimality in less than 0.4s per instance. It is furthermore shown that several practical additions to the MCPRP, such as different start and end locations of patrol cars and overlapping shift durations can be modeled by a multi-commodity minimum cost network flow model and solved to optimality in acceptable computational times given the sizes of practical instances.

AB In classical branch-and-bound algorithms, the branching disjunction is often based on a single variable, which is a special case of the more general approach that involves multiple variables. In this paper, we present a new approach to generate good general branching disjunctions based on the shape of the polyhedron and interior-point concepts. The approach is based on approximating the feasible polyhedron using Dikin's inscribed ellipsoid, calculated using the analytic center from interior-point methods. We use the fact that the width of the ellipsoid in a given direction has a closed form expression to formulate a quadratic problem whose optimal solution is a thin direction of the ellipsoid. While solving a quadratic problem at each node of the branch-and-bound tree is impractical, we use an efficient neighborhood search heuristic for its solution. We report computational results on hard mixed integer problems from the literature showing that the proposed approach leads to smaller branch-and-bound trees and a reduction in the computational time as compared with classical branching and strong branching. As the computation of the analytic center is a bottleneck, we finally test the approach within a general interior-point based Benders decomposition where the analytic center is readily available, and show clear dominance of the approach over classical branching.

AB The problem of allocating a pool of cross-trained workers across multiple departments, units, or work centers is important for both manufacturing and service environments. Within the context of services, such as hospital nursing, the problem has commonly been formulated as a nonlinear assignment problem with an operationally-oriented objective function that focuses on the maximization of service utility as a function of deviations from target staffing levels in the departments. However, service managers might also deem it appropriate to consider human resource-oriented goals, such as accommodating worker preferences, avoiding decay of skill productivity, or the provision of training. We present a bicriterion formulation of the nonlinear worker assignment problem that incorporates both operational and human resource objective criteria. An algorithm for generating the entire Pareto efficient set associated with the bicriterion model is subsequently presented. A small numerical example is used to illustrate the bicriterion model and algorithm. A second example based on a test problem from the literature is also contained in the paper, and a third example is provided in an online supplement. In addition, a simulation experiment was conducted to evaluate the sensitivity of the algorithm to a variety of environmental characteristics.

AB In the Synchronized Pickup and Delivery Problem (SPDP), user-specified transportation requests from origin to destination points have to be serviced by a fleet of homogeneous vehicles. The task is to find a set of minimum-cost routes satisfying pairing and precedence, capacities, and time windows. Additionally, temporal synchronization constraints couple the service times at the pickup and delivery locations of the customer requests in the following way: a request has to be delivered within prespecified minimum and maximum time lags (called ride times) after it has been picked up. The presence of these ride-time constraints severely complicates the subproblem of the natural column-generation formulation of the SPDP so that it is not clear if their integration into the subproblem pays off in an integer column-generation approach. Therefore, we develop four branch-and-cut-and-price algorithms for the SPDP based on column-generation formulations that use different subproblems. Two of these subproblems are considered for the first time in this paper have not been studied before. We derive new dominance rules and labeling algorithms for their effective solution. Extensive computational results indicate that integrating either both types of ride-time constraints or only the maximum ride-time constraints into the subproblem results in the strongest overall approach.

AB This paper analyzes the bullwhip effect in multi-echelon supply chains under a general class of nonlinear ordering policies. A describing-function approach from control theory is used to derive closed-form formulas to predict amplification of order fluctuations along the supply chain. It is proven that with consideration of nonlinearity in the ordering policy, the magnitude of the bullwhip effect will eventually become bounded after growing through the first few stages of the supply chain. It is also proven that the average customer demand as well as the demand fluctuation frequency would directly affect the bounded magnitude, while the suppliers' demand forecasting method has no effect at all. For illustration, analytical results for a class of order-up-to policies are derived and verified by numerical simulations. The proposed modeling framework holds the promise to not only explain empirical observations, but also serve as the basis for developing counteracting strategies against the bullwhip effect.

AB This article presents a mixed integer nonlinear programming model to find the optimal selling price and replenishment policy for a particular type of product in a supply chain defined by a single retailer and multiple potential suppliers. Each supplier offers all-unit quantity discounts as an incentive mechanism. Multiple orders are allowed to be submitted to the selected suppliers during a repeating order cycle. The demand rate is considered to be not constant but dependent upon the selling price. The model provides the optimal number of orders and corresponding order quantities for the selected suppliers, and the optimal demand rate and selling price that maximize the total profit per time unit under suppliers' capacity and quality constraints. In addition, we provide sufficient conditions under which there exists an optimal solution where the retailer only orders from one supplier. We also apply the Karush Kuhn Tucker conditions to investigate the impact of supplier's capacity on the optimal sourcing strategy. The results show that, there may exist a range of capacity values for the dominating supplier, where the retailer's optimal sourcing strategy is to consider multiple suppliers without fully utilizing the dominating supplier's capacity. A numerical example is presented to illustrate the proposed model.

ID CONSTRAINT; ALGORITHM; SUBJECT; MODEL
AB This paper is concerned with the single-item inventory system with resource constraint and all-units quantity discount under continuous review where demand is stochastic and discrete. In most actual inventory systems, the resource available for inventory management is limited and the system is able to confront the resource shortage by charging more costs. Considering the resource constraint as a soft constraint beside a quantity discount opportunity makes the model more practical. An optimization problem is formulated for finding an optimal (r, Q) policy for the problem in which the per unit resource usage depends on unit purchasing price. The properties of the cost function are investigated and then an algorithm based on a one-dimensional search procedure is proposed for finding an optimal (r, Q) policy which minimizes the expected system costs and converges to a global optimum. Based on the properties of the partially conditioned cost functions, the presented algorithm is modified such that its search path to optimal policy is changed. Experimental results show that the performance of the modified version of the presented algorithm is much better than the original algorithm in various environments of test problems.

DE Inventory; Vehicle fleet size; Excess transportation capacity
ID INVENTORY SYSTEMS; MODE SELECTION; LEAD TIMES; POLICIES
AB In this paper we consider a segment of a supply chain comprising an inventory and a transportation system that cooperate in the fulfillment of stochastic customer orders. The inventory is operated under a discrete time (r, s, q) policy with backorders. The transportation system consists of an in-house transportation capacity which can be extended by costly external transportation capacity (such as a third-party logistics provider). We show that in a system of this kind stock-outs and the resulting accumulation of inventory backorders introduces volatility in the workload of the transportation process. Geunes and Zeng (2001) have shown for a base-stock system, that backordering decreases the variability of transportation orders. Our findings show that in inventory systems with order cycles longer than one period the opposite is true. In both cases, however, inventory decisions and transportation decision must be taken simultaneously.
   We present a procedure to compute the probability distribution of the number of transportation orders and the resulting excess transportation requirements or rather transportation costs. We show that the increase of transportation costs resulting from a safety stock reduction may offset the change of the inventory costs. This effect may have a significant impact on general optimality statements for multi-echelon inventory systems.

AB We study the operational problem of a make-to-order contract manufacturer seeking to integrate production scheduling and transportation planning for improved performance under commit-to-delivery model. The manufacturer produces customer orders on a set of unrelated parallel lines/processors, accounting for release dates and sequence dependent setup times. A set of shipping options with different costs and transit times is available for order delivery through the third party logistics service providers. The objective is to manufacture and deliver multiple customer orders by selecting from the available shipping options, before preset due dates to minimize total cost of fulfilling orders, including tardiness penalties. We model the problem as a mixed integer programming model and provide a novel decomposition scheme to solve the problem. An exact dynamic programming model and a heuristics approach are presented to solve the sub-problems. The performance of the solution algorithm is tested through a set of experimental studies and results are presented. The algorithm is shown to efficiently solve the test cases, even the complex instances, to near optimality.

AB This paper considers single-component repairable systems supporting different levels of workloads and subject to random repair times. The mission is successful if the system can perform a specified amount of work within the maximum allowed mission time. The system can work with different load levels, each corresponding to different productivity, time-to-failure distribution, and per time unit operation cost. A numerical algorithm is first suggested to evaluate mission success probability and conditional expected cost of a successful mission for the considered repairable system. The load optimization problem is then formulated and solved for finding the system load level that minimizes the expected mission cost subject to providing a desired level of the mission success probability. Examples with discrete and continuous load variation are provided to illustrate the proposed methodology. Effects of repair efficiency, repair time distribution, and maximum allowed time on the mission reliability and cost are also investigated through the examples.

AB A new one factor model with a random volatility parameter is presented in this paper for pricing of electricity futures contracts. It is shown that the model is more tractable than multi-factor jump diffusion models and yields an approximate closed-form pricing formula for the electricity futures prices. On real market data, it is shown that the performance of the new model compares favourably with two existing models in the literature, viz, a two factor jump diffusion model and its jump free version, i.e., a two factor linear Gaussian model, in terms of ability to predict one day ahead futures prices. Further, a multi-stage procedure is suggested and implemented for calibration of the two factor jump diffusion model, which alleviates the difficulty in calibration due to a large number of parameters and pricing formulae which involve numerical evaluation of integrals. We demonstrate the utility of our new model, as well as the utility of the calibration procedure for the existing two factor jump diffusion model, by model calibration and price forecasting experiments on three different futures price data sets from Nord pool electricity data. For the jump diffusion model, we also investigate empirically whether it performs better in terms of futures price prediction than a corresponding, jump-free linear Gaussian model. Finally, we investigate whether an explicit calibration of jump risk premium in the jump diffusion model adds value to the quality of futures price prediction. Our experiments do not yield any evidence that modelling jumps leads to a better price prediction in electricity markets.

AB The transformation of the European electricity system requires substantial investment in transmission capacity to facilitate cross-border trade and to efficiently integrate renewable energy sources. However, network planning in the EU is still mainly a national prerogative. In contrast to other studies aiming to identify the pan-European (continental) welfare-optimal transmission expansion, we investigate the impact of zonal planners deciding on network investment strategically, with the aim of maximizing the sum of consumer surplus, generator profits and congestion rents in their jurisdiction. This reflects the inadequacy of current mechanisms to compensate for welfare re-allocations across national boundaries arising from network upgrades.
   We propose a three-stage equilibrium model to describe the Nash game between zonal planners (i.e., national governments, regulators, or system operators), each taking into account the impact of network expansion on the electricity spot market and the resulting welfare effects on the constituents within its jurisdiction. We propose a novel way to solve the resulting GNE/EPEC-type problem using a variation of a disjunctive constraints reformulation. This allows to solve this problem without a priori assumptions on the relative valuation of shared constraints by each player.
   Using a four-node sample network, we identify several Nash equilibria of the game between the zonal planners. This example illustrates the failure to reach the first-best welfare expansion in the absence of an effective framework for cross-border cost-benefit allocation.

AB This paper proposes to investigate the impact of financialization on energy markets (oil, gas, coal, and electricity European forward prices) during both normal times and periods of extreme fluctuation by using an original behavioral and emotional approach. With this aim, we propose a new theoretical and empirical framework based on a heterogeneous agents model in which fundamentalists and chartists co-exist and are subject to regret and uncertainty. We find significant evidence that energy markets are composed of heterogeneous traders who behave differently depending on the intensity of the price fluctuations and the uncertainty context. In particular, energy prices are governed primarily by fundamental and chartist agents that are neutral to uncertainty during normal times, whereas these prices face irrational chartist investors averse to uncertainty during periods of extreme fluctuations. In this context, the recent surge in energy prices can be viewed as the consequence of irrational exuberance. Our new theoretical model is suitable for modeling energy price dynamics and outperforms both the random walk and the ARMA model in out-of-sample predictive ability.

AB This paper deals with a generalized version of the capacitated p-center problem. The model takes into account the possibility that a center might suffer a disruption (being unavailable to serve some demand) and assumes that every site will be covered by its closest available center. The problem is of interest when the goal is to locate emergency centers while, at the same time, taking precautions against an unforeseen incident (natural disaster, labor strike, accident...) which can cause failure of a center. We consider different formulations for the problem and extensive computational tests are reported, showing the potentials and limits of each formulation in several types of instances. Finally, a preprocessing phase for fixing variables has been developed and different families of valid inequalities have been proposed to strengthen the most promising formulations, obtaining in some cases much better resolution times.

AB Theory of constraints has been commonly used in production systems to improve productivity. Since the improvement on an upstream workstation may have impact on its downstream servers, finding the true bottleneck is not trivial in a stochastic production line. Due to the analytical intractability of general tandem queues, we develop methods to quantify the dependence among stations through simulation. Dependence is defined by the contribution queue time at each station, and contribution factors are developed based on the insight from Friedman's reduction method and Jackson networks. In a tandem queue, the dependence among stations can be either diffusion or blocking, and their impact depends on the positions relative to the bottlenecks. Based on these results, we show that improving the performance of the system bottleneck may not be the most effective place to reduce system cycle time. Rather than making independence assumptions, the proposed method points out a promising direction and sheds light on the insights of the dependence in practical systems.

AB This paper examines the conditions for a widespread adoption of Carbon Capture transport and Storage (CCS) by a group of emitters that can be connected to a common CO2 pipeline. It details a modeling framework aimed at assessing the critical value in the charge for the CO2 emissions required for each of the emitters to decide to implement capture capabilities. This model can be used to analyze how the tariff structure imposed on the CO2 pipeline operator modifies the overall cost of CO2 abatement via CCS. This framework is applied to the case of a real European CO2 pipeline project. We find that the obligation to use cross-subsidy-free pipeline tariffs has a minor impact on the minimum CO2 price required to adopt the CCS. In contrast, the obligation to charge non-discriminatory prices can either impede the adoption of CCS or significantly raise that price. Besides which, we compared two alternative regulatory frameworks for CO2 pipelines: a common European organization as opposed to a collection of national regulations. The results indicate that the institutional scope of that regulation has a limited impact on the adoption of CCS compared to the detailed design of the tariff structure imposed on pipeline operators.

AB Global population ageing is creating immense pressures on hospitals and other healthcare services, compromising their abilities to meet the growing demand from elderly patients. Current demand-supply gaps result in prolonged waiting times in emergency departments (EDs), and several studies have focused on improving ED performance. However, the overcrowding in EDs generally stems from delayed patient flows to inpatient wards - which are congested with inpatients waiting for beds in post-acute facilities. This problem of bed blocking in acute hospitals causes substantial cost burdens on hospitals. This study presents a system dynamics methodology to model the dynamic flow of elderly patients in the Irish healthcare system aimed at gaining a better understanding of the dynamic complexity caused by the system's various parameters. The model evaluates the stock and flow interventions that Irish healthcare executives have proposed to address the problem of delayed discharges, and ultimately reduce costs. The anticipated growth in the nation's demography is also incorporated in the model. Policy makers can also use the model to identify the potential strategic risks that might arise from the unintended consequences of new policies designed to overcome the problem of the delayed discharge of elderly patients.

AB An effective emergency medical service (EMS) is a critical part of any health care system. This paper presents the optimization of EMS vehicle fleet allocation and base station location through the use of a genetic algorithm (GA) with an integrated EMS simulation model. Two tiers to the EMS model realized the different demands on two vehicle classes; ambulances and rapid response cars. Multiple patient classes were modelled and survival functions used to differentiate the required levels of service. The objective was maximization of the overall expected survival probability across patient classes. Applications of the model were undertaken using real call data from the London Ambulance Service. The simulation model was shown to effectively emulate real-life performance. Optimization of the existing resource plan resulted in significant improvements in survival probability. Optimizing a selection of 1 hour periods in the plan, without introducing additional resources, resulted in a notable increase in the number of cardiac arrest patients surviving per year. The introduction of an additional base station further improved survival when its location and resourcing were optimized for key periods of service. Also, the removal of a base station from the system was found to have minimal impact on survival probability when the selected station and resourcing were optimized simultaneously.

ID MAINTENANCE; MAINTAINABILITY; LEVEL
AB Defective capital assets may be quickly restored to their operational condition by replacing the item that has failed. The item that is replaced is called the Line Replaceable Unit (LRU), and the so-called LRU definition problem is the problem of deciding on which item to replace upon each type of failure: when a replacement action is required in the field, service engineers can either replace the failed item itself or replace a parent assembly that holds the failed item. One option may be fast but expensive, while the other may take longer but against lower cost. We consider a maintenance organization that services a fleet of assets, so that unavailability due to maintenance downtime may be compensated by acquiring additional standby assets. The objective of the LRU-definition problem is to minimize the total cost of item replacement and the investment in additional assets, given a constraint on the availability of the fleet of assets. We link this problem to the literature. We also present two cases to show how the problem is treated in practice. We next model the problem as a mixed integer linear programming formulation, and we use a numerical experiment to illustrate the model, and the potential cost reductions that using such a model may lead to.

AB Considering key uncertainties and health policy options in the reorganization of a long-term care (LTC) network is crucial. This study proposes a stochastic mixed integer linear programming model for planning the delivery of LTC services within a network of care where such aspects are modeled in an integrated manner. The model assists health care planners on how to plan the delivery of the entire range of LTC services institutional, home-based and ambulatory services when the main policy objective is the minimization of expected costs and while respecting satisficing levels of equity. These equity levels are modeled as constraints, ensuring the attainment of equity of access, equity of utilization, socioeconomic equity and geographical equity. The proposed model provides planners with key information on: when and where to locate services and with which capacity, how to distribute this capacity across services and patient groups, and which changes to the network of care are needed over time. Model outputs take into account the uncertainty surrounding LTC demand, and consider strategic health policy options adopted by governments. The applicability of the model is demonstrated through the resolution of a case study in the Great Lisbon region in Portugal with estimates on the equity-cost trade-off for several equity dimensions being provided.

AB A company's assortment of products and corresponding inventory levels are constrained by available resources, such as production capacity, storage space, and capital to acquire the inventory. Thus, customers may not always be able to find a most preferred product at the time of purchase; this unsatisfied demand is often substituted with an alternative. In the extant literature, there have been an increasing number of studies that consider product substitution when planning product assortment, inventory, and capacity, in conjunction with pricing. In this paper we classify the literature on the planning of substitutable products published in the major OM and marketing journals during the past thirty years (1974-2013) and present a comprehensive taxonomy of the literature. One criterion is adopted to discuss modeling objectives, and three major criteria are provided to define the nature of product substitution, including substitution mechanism, substitution decision maker, and direction of substitutability. We also identify research gaps to provide guidance for related research in the future.

AB We investigate the impact of advance notice of product returns on the performance of a decentralised closed loop supply chain. The market demands and the product returns are stochastic and are correlated with each other. The returned products are converted into "as-good-as-new" products and used, together with new products, to satisfy the market demand. The remanufacturing process takes time and is subject to a random yield. We investigate the benefit of the manufacturer obtaining advance notice of product returns from the remanufacturer. We demonstrate that lead times, random yields and the parameters describing the returns play a significant role in the benefit of the advance notice scheme. Our mathematical results offer insights into the benefits of lead time reduction and the adoption of information sharing schemes.

AB A new group decision-making approach is developed to address a multiple criteria sorting problem with uncertainty. The uncertainty in this paper refers to imprecise evaluations of alternatives with respect to the considered criteria. The belief structure and the evidential reasoning approach are employed to represent and aggregate the uncertain evaluations. In our approach, the preference information elicited from a group of decision makers is composed of the assignment examples of some reference alternatives. The disaggregation-aggregation paradigm is utilized to infer compatible preference models from these assignment examples. To help the group reach an agreement on the assignment of alternatives, we propose a consensus-reaching process. In this process, a consensus degree is defined to measure the agreement among the decision makers' opinions. When the decision makers are not satisfied with the consensus degree, possible solutions are explored to help them adjust assignment examples in order to improve the consensus level. If the consensus degree arrives at a satisfactory level, a linear program is built to determine the collective assignment of alternatives. The application of the proposed approach to a customer satisfaction analysis is presented at the end of the paper.

AB The reliability of an expert is an important concept in multiple attribute group decision analysis (MAGDA). However, reliability is rarely considered in MAGDA, or it may. be simply assumed that all experts are fully reliable and thus their reliabilities do not need to be considered explicitly. In fact, any experts can Only be bounded rational and their various degrees of reliabilities may significantly influence MAGDA results. In this paper, we propose a new method based on the evidential reasoning rule to explicitly measure the reliability of each expert in a group and use expert weights and reliabilities to combine expert assessments. Two sets of assessments, i.e., original assessments and updated assessments provided after group analysis and discussion are taken into account to measure expert reliabilities. When the assessments of some experts are incomplete while global ignorance is incurred, pairs of optimization problems are constructed to decide interval-valued expert reliabilities. The resulting expert reliabilities are applied to combine the expert assessments of alternatives on each attribute and then to generate the aggregated assessments of alternatives. An industry evaluation problem in Wuhu, a city in Anhui Province of China is analyzed by using the proposed method as a real case study to demonstrate its detailed implementation process, validity, and applicability.

AB This paper discusses a two level hierarchical time minimization transportation problem, in which the whole set of source-destination links consists of two disjoint partitions namely Level-I and Level-II links. Some quantity of a homogeneous product is first shipped from sources to destinations by Level-I decision makers using only Level-I links, and on its completion the Level-II decision maker transports the remaining quantity of the product in an optimal fashion using only Level-II links. The objective is to find that feasible solution for Level-I decision corresponding to which the optimal feasible solution for Level-II decision maker is such that the sum of shipment times in Level-I and Level-Ills minimum. A polynomial time iterative algorithm is proposed to solve the two level hierarchical time minimization transportation problem. At each iteration a lexicographic optimal solution of a restricted version of a related standard time minimization transportation problem is examined to generate a pair of Level-I and Level-II shipment times and finally the global optimal solution is obtained by selecting the best out of these generated pairs. Numerical illustration is included in support of theory.

AB Duality results on countably infinite linear programs are scarce. Subspaces that admit an interior point, which is-a sufficient condition for a-zero-duality-gap, yield-a-dual_where the constraints_cannot_be expressed using the ordinary transpose of the primal constraint matrix. Subspaces that permit a dual with this transpose do not admit an interior point. This difficulty has stumped researchers for a few decades; it has recently been called the Slater conundrum. We find a way around this hurdle.
   We propose a pair of primal-dual spaces with three properties: the series in the primal and dual objective functions converge; the series defined by the rows and columns of the primal constraint matrix converge; and the order of sums in a particular iterated series of a double sequence defined by the primal constraint matrix can be interchanged so that the dual is defined by the ordinary transpose. Weak duality and complementary slackness are then immediate. Instead of using interior point conditions to establish a zero duality gap, we call upon the planning horizon method. When the series in the primal and dual constraints are continuous, we prove that strong duality holds if a sequence of optimal solutions to finite-dimensional truncations of the primal and dual CILPs has an accumulation point. We show by counterexample that the requirement that such an accumulation point exist cannot be relaxed. Our results are illustrated using several examples, and are applied to countable-state Markov decision processes and to a problem in robust optimization.

Supplies of several different product types (glass of different colors) are available at customer locations. The supplies have to be picked up at their locations and moved to a central depot at minimum cost. Different product types may be transported on the same vehicle, however, while being transported they must not be mixed. Technically this is enabled by a specific device, which allows for separating the capacity of each vehicle individually into a limited number of compartments where each compartment can accommodate one or several supplies of the same product type. For this problem, a model formulation and a variable neighborhood search algorithm for its solution are presented. The performance of the proposed heuristic is evaluated by means of extensive numerical experiments. Furthermore, the economic benefits of introducing compartments on the vehicles are investigated.

AB The Set Covering Problem (SCP) is NP-hard. We propose a new Row Weighting Local Search (RWLS) algorithm for solving the unicost variant of the SCP, i.e., USCPs where the costs of all sets are identical. RWLS is a heuristic algorithm that has three major components united in its local search framework: (1) a weighting scheme, which updates the weights of uncovered elements to prevent convergence to local optima, (2) tabu strategies to avoid possible cycles during the search, and (3) a timestamp method to break ties when prioritizing sets. AWLS has been evaluated on a large number of problem instances from the OR-Library and compared with other approaches. It is able to find all the best known solutions (BKS) and improve 14 of them, although requiring a higher computational effort on several instances. RWLS is especially effective on the combinatorial OR-Library instances and can improve the best known solution to the hardest instance CYC11 considerably. RWLS is conceptually simple and has no instance-dependent parameters, which makes it a practical and easy-to-use USCP solver.

AB Decision making on the selection of transportation infrastructure projects is an interesting subject to both transportation authorities and researchers,Due to-re-source-limitations,the selected projects should then be. scheduled during the planning horizon. Integration of selecting and scheduling projects into a single model increases the accuracy of results; however it leads to more complexity. In this paper, first, three different mathematical programming models are presented to integrate selecting and scheduling of urban road construction projects as a time-dependent discrete network design problem. Then, the model that seems more flexible and realistic is selected and an evolutionary approach is proposed to solve it. The proposed approach is a combination of three well-known techniques: the phase-I of the two-phase simplex method, Frank-Wolfe algorithm, and genetic algorithm. Taguchi method is used to optimize the genetic algorithm parameters. The main difficulty in solving the model is due to the large number of subsequent network traffic assignment problems that should be solved which makes the solution process very time-consuming. Therefore, a procedure is proposed to overcome this difficulty by significantly reducing the traffic assignment problem solution time. In order to verify the performance of the proposed approach, 27 randomly generated test problems of different scales are applied to Sioux Falls urban transportation network. The proposed approach and full enumeration method are used to solve the problems. Numerical results show that the proposed approach has an acceptable performance in terms of both solution quality and solution time.

AB This paper proposes an optimization model for high-speed railway scheduling. The model is composed of two sub-models. The first is a discrete event simulation model which represents the supply of the railway services whereas the second is a constrained logit-type choice model which takes into account the behaviour of users. This discrete choice model evaluates the attributes of railway services such as the timetable, fare, travel time and seat availability (capacity constraints) and computes the High-Speed railway demand for each planned train service.
   A hybridisation of a Standard Particle Swarm Optimisation and Nealder-Mead methods has been applied for solving the proposed model and a real case study of the High-Speed corridor Madrid-Seville in Spain has been analysed. Furthermore, parallel computation strategies are used to speed up the proposed approach.

AB We study a distribution warehouse in which trailers need to be assigned to docks for loading or unloading. A parking lot is used as a buffer zone and transportation between the parking lot and the docks is performed by auxiliary resources called terminal tractors. Each incoming trailer has a known arrival time and each outgoing trailer a desired departure time. The primary objective is to produce a docking schedule such that the weighted sum of the number of late outgoing trailers and the tardiness of these trailers is minimized; the secondary objective is to minimize the weighted completion time of all trailers, both incoming and outgoing. The purpose of this paper is to produce high-quality solutions to large instances that are comparable to a real-life case. This will oblige us to abandon the guarantee of always finding an optimal solution, and we will instead look into a number of sub-optimal procedures. We implement four different methods: a mathematical formulation that can be solved using an IP solver, a branch-and-bound algorithm, a beam search procedure and a tabu search method. Lagrangian relaxation is embedded in the algorithms for computing lower bounds. The different solution frameworks are compared via extensive computational experiments.

AB Given n facilities of prescribed lengths and a flow matrix, the single row facility layout problem (SRFLP) is to arrange the facilities along a straight line so as to minimize the total arrangement cost, which is the sum of the products of the flows and center-to-center distances between facilities. We propose interchange and insertion neighborhood exploration-(NE)-procedures with-time-complexity O(n(2)). which is an improvement over O(n(3))-time NE procedures from the literature. Numerical results show that, for large SRFLP instances, our insertion-based local search (LS) algorithm is two orders of magnitude faster than the best existing LS techniques. As a case study, we embed this LS algorithm into the variable neighborhood search (VNS) framework. We report computational results for SRFLP instances of size up to 300 facilities. They indicate that our VNS implementation offers markedly better performance than the variant of VNS that uses a recently proposed O(n(3))-time insertion-based NE procedure.

DE Supply chain management; Risk management; Coordination; Mean-variance;

ID CHANNEL; PRICE
AB We consider the coordination challenge with a risk-neutral manufacturer which supplies to multiple heterogeneou retailers. We find that the manufacturer can maximize its expected profit only if the expected profit of the supply chain is maximized, or equivalently supply chain coordination (SCC) is achieved. The target sales rebate (TSR) contract is commonly used in practice to achieve SCC. However, as we found in this paper, the presence of heterogeneity in retailers' minimum expected profit requirements is the major cause that a single TSR contract and the related single hybrid contracts all fail to achieve SCC and maximize the manufacturer's expected profit simultaneously. Thus, we develop an innovative menu of TSR contracts with fixed order quantity (TSR-FOQ). Although there are multiple contracts in a menu, we find that the manufacturer only needs to decide one basic TSR contract and two newly developed parameters termed as the risk-level indicator and the separation indicator, in applying the sophisticated menu of TSR-FOQ. By adjusting the two indicators, the manufacturer can control the profit variance of the retailers and the separations of the component contracts of the menu. We further propose another sophisticated menu of TSR with minimum order quantity and quantity discount contracts which can give each retailer a higher degree of freedom in the selection of order quantity. Differences between the two menus are analytically examined. Some meaningful managerial insights are generated.

ID CONTRACTS; RETAILER; STRATEGIES
AB This paper investigates the effect of information updating on the members of a two-stage supply chain in the presence of spot market. The supplier decides the contract price. New information becomes available as time progresses. The manufacturer updates his belief on demand and/or spot price and subsequently decides the contract quantity. The demand and spot price are correlated. Thus, the new demand information also updates the belief on the spot price, and vice versa. We model the problem with an information updating Stackelberg game and derive unique equilibrium strategies. Previous studies have considered only the demand information and concluded that improved demand information always benefits the supplier. By contrast, we demonstrate that improved demand information benefits both the supplier and manufacturer if the correlation coefficient between the two uncertainties has a small positive value and benefits the manufacturer but hurts the supplier otherwise. Moreover, superior spot price information benefits only the manufacturer and always hurts the supplier. Surprisingly, superior information fails to improve the performance of the supply chain and only changes the allocation of the profits between the supplier and manufacturer. Our findings likewise provide insights into when the supplier intends to use the contract channel and which type of information updating facility or expertise to invest in if a choice must be made.

AB Container ships in a string may not have the same capacity. Therefore, the sequence of ships affects the number of containers that are delayed at export ports due to demand uncertainty, for instance, "a large ship, followed by a small ship, then another large ship, and finally another small ship" is better than "a large ship, followed by another large ship, then a small ship, and finally another small ship". We hence aim to determine the sequence of the ships in a string to minimize the delay of containers, without requiring the probability distribution functions for the future demand. We propose three rules to identify an optimal or near-optimal string. The rules have been proved to be effective based on extensive numerical experiments. A rough estimation indicates that over 6 million dollars/year could be saved for all liner services in the world by optimizing the sequences of ships.

AB This work considers a continuous inventory replenishment system where demand is stochastic and dependent on the state of the environment. A Markov Modulated Poisson Process (MMPP) is utilized to model the demand process where the corresponding embedded Markov Chain represents the state of the environment. The equation's to calculate the system inventory measures and the number of orders per unit time are obtained for a continuous, infinite horizon and dynamically changing (s, S) policy. An efficient optimization heuristic is presented and compared to the commonly used approach of approximating the demand-count process over the lead time with a Normal distribution. An investigation of the MMPP demand process is considered where we quantify the impact of variability in the demand-count process which is due to auto-correlation. Our findings indicate that when demand correlation is high, a dynamic control, where the (s, S) policy changes with state of the environment governing the MMPP, is highly superior to the commonly used "static" heuristics. We propose two dynamic policies of varying computational complexity, and cost efficiency, depending on the class of the product (one for class A, and one for classes B and C), to handle such high-correlation situations.

In this relaxation any player within a coalition is allowed to step out from his position in the processing order and to step in at any position later in the processing order. First, we show that if the value of a coalition in a relaxed sequencing game is bounded from above by the gains made by all possible neighbor switches, then the game has a non-empty core. After that, we show that this is the case for Step out-Step in sequencing games. Moreover, this paper provides a polynomial time algorithm to determine the values of the coalitions in Step out-Step in sequencing games.

AB This paper proposes a nonlinear integer program for determining an optimal plan of zero-defect, single-sampling by attributes for incoming inspections in assembly lines. Individual parts coming to an assembly line differ in the non-conforming (NC) risk, NC severity, lot size, and inspection cost-effectiveness. The proposed optimization model is able to determine the inspection sample size for each of the parts in a resource constrained condition where a product's NC risk is not a linear combination of NC risks of the individual parts. This paper develops a three-step solution procedure that effectively reduces the solution time for larger size problems commonly seen in assembly lines. The proposed optimization model provides insightful implications for quality management. For example, it reveals the principle of sample size decisions for heterogeneous, dependent parts waiting for incoming inspections; as well as provides a tool for quantifying the expected return from investing additional inspection resources. The optimization model builds a foundation for extensions to advanced inspection sampling plans.

AB The literature reveals contradiction between theoretical results (superiority of uniform policy under a concave-advertising-response function) and empirical results (concavity of the advertising response function and the superiority of a pulsation policy). To reconcile the above difference, This paper offers a resolution based on (1) the concavity of the advertising response function; (2) the convexity of the firm's cost function; and (3) over-advertising. The resolution is reached upon maximizing the net profit per unit time over the infinite planning horizon subject to an exogenous advertising budget constraint. Theoretical results for monopolistic markets are found mostly generalized to competitive markets. A numerical example is introduced to gain more insight into the theoretical findings and an approach is introduced and implemented to empirically assess the shape of a firm's cost function and the advertising policy to be employed.

AB In this paper, we are interested in the label ranking problem. We are more specifically interested in the recent trend consisting in predicting partial but more accurate (i.e., making less incorrect statements) orders rather than complete ones. To do so, we propose a ranking method based on label-wise decomposition. We estimate an imprecise probabilistic model over each label rank and we infer a partial order from it using optimization techniques. This leads to new results concerning a particular bilinear assignment problem. Finally, we provide some experiments showing the feasibility of our method.

Since the set of anchor points is a subset of the set of extreme units, a definition of extreme units in non-convex technologies as well as a new method for obtaining these units are given. Finally, a polynomial-time algorithm for identification of the anchor points in FDH models is provided.

Each app developer simultaneously determines the selling price of his app and the extent to which he invests in its quality. The demand for the app, which depends on both price and quality investment, is uncertain, so the risk attitudes of the supply chain members have to be considered. The members' equilibrium strategies are analyzed under different attitudes toward risk: risk-aversion, risk-neutrality and risk-seeking. We show that the retailer's utility function has no effect on the equilibrium strategies, and suggest schemes to identify these strategies for any utility function of the developers.

AB Scheduling involving setup times/costs plays an important role in today's modern manufacturing and service environments for the delivery of reliable products on time. The setup process is not a value added factor, and hence, setup times/costs need to be explicitly considered while scheduling decisions are made in order to increase productivity, eliminate waste, improve resource utilization, and meet deadlines. However, the vast majority of existing scheduling literature, more than 90 percent, ignores this fact. The interest in scheduling problems where setup times/costs are explicitly considered began in the mid-1960s and the interest has been increasing even though not at an anticipated level. The first comprehensive review paper (Allahverdi et al., 1999) on scheduling problems with setup times/costs was in 1999 covering about 200 papers, from mid-1960s to mid-1988, while the second comprehensive review paper (Allahverdi et al., 2008) covered about 300 papers which were published from mid-1998 to mid-2006. This paper is the third comprehensive survey paper which provides an extensive review of about 500 papers that have appeared since the mid-2006 to the end of 2014, including static, dynamic, deterministic, and stochastic environments. This review paper classifies scheduling problems based on shop environments as single machine, parallel machine, flowshop, job shop, or open shop. It further classifies the problems as family and non-family as well as sequence-dependent and sequence-independent setup times/costs. Given that so many papers have been published in a relatively short period of time, different researchers have addressed the same problem independently, by even using the same methodology. Throughout the survey paper, the independently addressed problems are identified, and need for comparing these results is emphasized. Moreover, based on performance measures shop and setup times/costs environments, the less studied problems have been identified and the need to address these problems is specified. The current survey paper, along with those of Allahverdi et al. (1999, 2008), is an up to date survey of scheduling problems involving static, dynamic, deterministic, and stochastic problems for different shop environments with setup times/costs since the first research on the topic appeared in the mid-1960s.

DE Scheduling; Flowshop; Stochastic; Makespan objective; Heuristics
ID SEQUENCING PROBLEM; MAKESPAN; TIMES
AB We address the problem of scheduling jobs in a permutation flowshop when their processing times adopt a given distribution (stochastic flowshop scheduling problem) with the objective of minimization of the expected makespan. For this problem, optimal solutions exist only for very specific cases. Consequently, some heuristics have been proposed in the literature, all of them with similar performance. In our paper, we first focus on the critical issue of estimating the expected makespan of a sequence and found that, for instances with a medium/large variability (expressed as the coefficient of variation of the processing times of the jobs), the number of samples or simulation runs usually employed in the literature may not be sufficient to derive robust conclusions with respect to the performance of the different heuristics. We thus propose a procedure with a variable number of iterations that ensures that the percentage error in the estimation of the expected makespan is bounded with a very high probability. Using this procedure, we test the main heuristics proposed in the literature and find significant differences in their performance, in contrast with existing studies. We also find that the deterministic counterpart of the most efficient heuristic for the stochastic problem performs extremely well for most settings, which indicates that, in some cases, solving the deterministic version of the problem may produce competitive solutions for the stochastic counterpart.

AB The paper proposes a model for stochastic multi-mode resource-constrained project scheduling under risk aversion with the two objectives makespan and cost. Activity durations and costs are assumed as uncertain and modeled as random variables. For the scheduling part of the decision problem, the class of early-start policies is considered. In addition to the schedule, the assignment of execution modes to activities has to be selected. To take risk aversion into account, the approach of optimization under multivariate stochastic dominance constraints, recently developed in other fields, is adopted. For the resulting bi-objective stochastic integer programming problem, the Pareto frontier is determined by means of an exact solution method, incorporating a branch-and-bound technique based on the forbidden set branching scheme from stochastic project scheduling. Randomly generated test instances, partially derived from a test case from the PSPLIB, are used to show the computational feasibility of the approach.

The methodology is based on soft systems methodology and is applicable to all types of organisation, both for profit and non-profit. The methodology begins with the top-level objectives of the organisation, developed through debate and discussion, and breaks these down into the key activities needed to achieve them. A range of stakeholders are identified for each key activity. At the end, the functions and relationships of all the stakeholder groups can clearly be seen. The methodology is illustrated with an actual case study in Hunan University.

AB In Brazil, due to public health, social and economic cohesion problems, access to water and wastewater services is certainly one of the main concerns of the different stakeholders in the Brazilian water sector. But as the focus is mainly on the expansion and building of new infrastructures, other features such as the robustness and resiliency of the systems are being forgotten. This reason, among others, highlights the importance of sustainable development and financing for the Brazilian water sector. In order to assess that goal, a multi-objective optimization model was built with the aim of formulating strategies to reach a predefined coverage minimizing time and costs incurred, under specific hard and soft constraints, assembled to deal with key sustainability concepts (e.g., affordability and coverage targets features) as they should not be left apart. For that purpose, an achievement scalarizing function was adopted with three distinct scaling coefficient vectors for a given reference point. To solve this combinatorial optimization problem, we used a mixed integer-linear programming optimizer that resorts to branch-and-bound methods. The work developed, paves the way toward the creation of a decision-aiding tool, without disregarding the number of steps that need to be taken to achieve the proposed objectives.

AB The Police Districting Problem (PDP) concerns the efficient and effective design of patrol sectors in terms of performance attributes such as workload, response time, etc. A balanced definition of the patrol sector is desirable as it results in crime reduction and in better service. In this paper, a multi-criteria Police Districting Problem defined in collaboration with the Spanish National Police Corps is presented. This is the first model for the PDP that considers the attributes of area, risk, compactness, and mutual support. The decision-maker can specify his/her preferences on the attributes, on workload balance, and efficiency. The model is solved by means of a heuristic algorithm that is empirically tested on a case study of the Central District of Madrid. The solutions identified by the model are compared to patrol sector configurations currently in use and their quality is evaluated by public safety service coordinators. The model and the algorithm produce designs that significantly improve on the current ones.

AB In projects with a flexible project structure, the activities that must be scheduled are not completely known in advance. Scheduling such projects includes deciding whether to perform particular activities. This decision also affects precedence constraints among the implemented activities. However, established model formulations and solution approaches for the resource-constrained project scheduling problem (RCPSP) assume that the project structure is provided in advance. In this paper, the traditional RCPSP is extended using a highly general model-endogenous decision on this flexible project structure. This extension is illustrated using the example of the aircraft turnaround process at airports. We present a genetic algorithm to solve this type of scheduling problem and evaluate it in an extensive numerical study.

AB Let G = (V, E) be an undirected graph with costs associated with its edges and K pre-specified root vertices. The K-rooted mini-max spanning forest problem asks for a spanning forest of G defined by exactly K mutually disjoint trees. Each tree must contain a different root vertex and the cost of the most expensive tree must be minimum. This paper introduces a Branch-and-cut algorithm for the problem. It involves a multi-start Linear Programming heuristic and the separation of some new optimality cuts. Extensive computational tests indicate that the new algorithm significantly improves on the results available in the literature. Improvements being reflected by lower CPU times, smaller enumeration trees, and optimality certificates for previously unattainable K = 2 instances with as many as 200 vertices. Furthermore, for the first time, instances of the problem with K E (3,4) are solved to proven optimality.

AB We introduce the integrative cooperative search method (ICS), a multi-thread cooperative search method for multi-attribute combinatorial optimization problems. ICS musters the combined capabilities of a number of independent exact or meta-heuristic solution methods. A number of these methods work on sub-problems defined by suitably selected subsets of decision-set attributes of the problem, while others combine the resulting partial solutions into complete ones and, eventually, improve them. All these methods cooperate through an adaptive search-guidance mechanism, using the central-memory cooperative search paradigm. Extensive numerical experiments explore the behavior of ICS and its interest through an application to the multi-depot, periodic vehicle routing problem, for which ICS improves the results of the current state-of-the-art methods.

AB Used products collected for value recovery are characterized by higher uncertainty regarding their quality condition compared to raw materials used in forward supply chains. Because of the need for timely information regarding their quality, a common business practice is to establish procedures for the classification of used products (returns), which is not always error-free. The existence of a multitude of sites where used products can be collected, further increases the complexity of reverse supply chain design and management. In this paper we formulate the objective function for a reverse supply chain with multiple collection sites and the possibility of returns sorting, assuming general distributions of demand and returns quality in a single-period context. We derive conditions for the determination of the optimal acquisition and remanufacturing lot-sizing decisions under alternative locations of the unreliable classification/sorting operation. We provide closed-form expressions for the selection of the optimal sorting location in the special case of identical collection sites and guidelines for tackling the decision-making problem in the general case. Furthermore, we examine analytically the effect of the cost and accuracy of the classification procedure on the profitability of the alternative supply chain configurations. Our analysis, which is accompanied by a brief numerical investigation, offers insights regarding the impact of yield variability, number of collection sites, and location and characteristics of the returns classification operation both on the acquisition decisions and on the profitability of the reverse supply chain.

AB The three main measures of competition (HHI, Lerner index, and H-statistic) are uncorrelated for U.S. banks. We investigate why this occurs, propose a frontier measure of competition, and apply it to five major bank service lines. Fee-based banking services comprise 35 percent of bank revenues so assessing competition by service line is preferred to using a single measure for traditional activities extended to the entire bank. As the Lerner index and the H-statistic together explain only 1 percent of HHI variation and the HHI is similarly unrelated to the frontier method developed here, current merger/acquisition guidelines should be adjusted as banking concentration seems unrelated to likely more accurate competition measures.

TI Decentral allocation planning in multi-stage customer hierarchies
SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF OPERATIONAL RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
DE Supply chain management; Demand fulfillment; Allocation planning;
   Customer hierarchies; Customer heterogeneity
AB This paper presents a novel allocation scheme to improve profits when splitting a scarce product among customer segments. These segments differ by demand and margin and they form a multi-level tree, e.g. according to a geography-based organizational structure. In practice, allocation has to follow an iterative process in which higher level quotas are disaggregated one level at a time, only based on local, aggregate information. We apply well-known econometric concepts such as the Lorenz curve and Theil's index of inequality to find a non-linear approximation of the profit function in the customer tree. Our resulting Approximate Profit Decentral Allocation (ADA) scheme ensures that a group of truthfully reporting decentral planners makes quasi-coordinated decisions in support of overall profit-maximization in the hierarchy. The new scheme outperforms existing simple rules by a large margin and comes close to the first-best theoretical solution under a central planner and central information.

ID COORDINATION; MANUFACTURER; DECISION; DEMAND; MANAGEMENT; PROMOTION
AB This work develops a stochastic model of a two-echelon supply chain of virtual products in which the decision makers-a manufacturer and a retailer-may be risk-sensitive. Virtual products allow the retailer to avoid holding costs and ensure timely fulfillment of demand with no risk of shortage. We expand on the work of Chernonog and Avinadav (2014), who investigated the pricing of virtual products under uncertain and price-dependent demand, by including sales-effort as a decision variable that affects demand. Whereas in the previous work equilibrium was obtained exactly as in a deterministic case for any utility function, herein it is not. Consequently, we focus on the strategies of both the manufacturer and the retailer under different profit criteria, including the use of bi-criteria. By formulating the problem as a Stackelberg game, we show that the problem can be analytically solved by assuming certain common structures of the demand function and of the preferences of both the manufacturer and the retailer with regard to risk. We extend the solution to the case of imperfect information regarding the preferences and offer guidelines for the formation of efficient sets of decisions under hi-criteria. Finally, we provide numerical results.

AB Empirically, cointegration and stochastic covariances, including stochastic volatilities, are statistically significant for commodity prices and energy products. To capture such market phenomena, we develop a continuous-time dynamics of cointegrated assets with a stochastic covariance matrix and derive the joint characteristic function of asset returns in closed-form. The proposed model offers an endogenous explanation for the stochastic mean-reverting convenience yield. The time series of spot and futures prices of WTI crude oil and gasoline shows cointegration relationship under both physical and risk-neutral measures. The proposed model also allows us to fit the observed term structure of futures prices and calibrate the marketimplied cointegration relationship. We apply it to value options on a single commodity and on multiple commodities.

AB Simulation optimization has gained popularity over the decades because of its ability to solve many practical problems that involve profound randomness. The methodology development of simulation optimization, however, is largely concerned with problems whose objective function is mean-based performance metric. In this paper, we propose a direct search method to solve the unconstrained simulation optimization problems with quantile-based objective functions. Because the proposed method does not require gradient estimation in the search process, it can be applied to solve many practical problems where the gradient of objective function does not exist or is difficult to estimate. We prove that the proposed method possesses desirable convergence guarantee, i.e., the algorithm can converge to the true global optima with probability one. An extensive numerical study shows that the performance of the proposed method is promising. Two illustrative examples are provided in the end to demonstrate the viability of the proposed method in real settings.

AB We introduce a new stochastic model for inflow time series that is designed with the requirements of hydropower scheduling problems in mind. The model is an "iterated function system": it models inflow as continuous, but the random innovation at each time step has a discrete distribution. With this inflow model, hydro-scheduling problems can be solved by the stochastic dual dynamic programming (SDDP) algorithm exactly as posed, without the additional sampling error introduced by sample average approximations. The model is fitted to univariate inflow time series by quantile regression. We consider various goodness-of-fit metrics for the new model and some alternatives to it, including performance in an actual hydro-scheduling problem. The numerical data used are for inflows to New Zealand hydropower reservoirs.

We prove that this problem remains NP-hard if instead of Condorcet winners the alternatives in the uncovered set win. Furthermore, we present a relation-algebraic model of Condorcet voting and relation-algebraic specifications of the dominance relation and the solutions of the control problem. All our relation-algebraic specifications immediately can be translated into the programming language of the OBDD-based computer system RELVIEW. Our approach is very flexible and especially appropriate for prototyping and experimentation, and as such very instructive for educational purposes.

AB In this paper we derive the exact solution of the multi-period portfolio choice problem for an exponential utility function under return predictability. It is assumed that the asset returns depend on predictable variables and that the joint random process of the asset returns and the predictable variables follow a vector autoregressive process. We prove that the optimal portfolio weights depend on the covariance matrices of the next two periods and the conditional mean vector of the next period. The case without predictable variables and the case of independent asset returns are partial cases of our solution. Furthermore, we provide an exhaustive empirical study where the cumulative empirical distribution function of the investor's wealth is calculated using the exact solution. It is compared with the investment strategy obtained under the additional assumption that the asset returns are independently distributed.

AB In the field of multicriteria decision aid, the Simos method is considered as an effective tool to assess the criteria importance weights. Nevertheless, the method's input data do not lead to a single weighting vector, but infinite ones, which often exhibit great diversification and threaten the stability and acceptability of the results. This paper proves that the feasible weighting solutions, of both the original and the revised Simos procedures, are vectors of a non-empty convex polyhedral set, hence the reason it proposes a set of complementary robustness analysis rules and measures, integrated in a Robust Simos Method. This framework supports analysts and decision makers in gaining insight into the degree of variation of the multiple acceptable sets of weights, and their impact on the stability of the final results. In addition, the proposed measures determine if, and what actions should be implemented, prior to reaching an acceptable set of criteria weights and forming a final decision. Two numerical examples are provided, to illustrate the paper's evidence, and demonstrate the significance of consistently analyzing the robustness of the Simos method results, in both the original and the revised method's versions.

AB This paper presents a novel nonparametric methodology to evaluate convergence in an industry, considering a multi-input multi-output setting for the assessment of total factor productivity. In particular, we develop two new indexes to evaluate sigma-convergence and beta-convergence that can be computed using nonparametric techniques such as Data Envelopment Analysis. The methodology developed is particularly useful to enhance productivity assessments based on the Malmquist index. The methodology is applied to a real world context, consisting of a sample of Portuguese construction companies that operated in the sector between 2008 and 2010. The empirical results show that Portuguese companies tended to converge, both in the sense of a and beta, in all construction activity segments in the aftermath of the financial crisis.

ID PAYOFFS
AB The purpose of this paper is to highlight a serious omission in the recent work of Li (2012) for solving the two person zero-sum matrix games with pay-offs of triangular fuzzy numbers (TFNs) and propose a new methodology for solving such games. Li (2012) proposed a method which always assures that the max player gain-floor and min player loss-ceiling have a common TFN value. The present paper exhibits a flaw in this claim of Li (2012). The flaw arises on account of Li (2012) not explaining the meaning of solution of game under consideration. The present paper attempts to provide certain appropriate modifications in Li's model to take care of this serious omission. These modifications in conjunction with the results of Clemente, Fernandez, and Puerto (2011) lead to an algorithm to solve matrix games with pay-offs of general piecewise linear fuzzy numbers.

AB One of the most significant and common techniques to accelerate user queries in multidimensional databases is view materialization. The problem of choosing an appropriate part of data structure for materialization under limited resources is known as the view selection problem. In this paper, the problem of the mean query execution time minimization under limited storage space is studied. Different heuristics based on a greedy method are examined, proofs regarding their performance are presented, and modifications for them are proposed, which not only improve the solution cost but also shorten the running time. Additionally, the heuristics and a widely used Integer Programming solver are experimentally compared with respect to the running time and the cost of solution. What distinguishes this comparison is its comprehensiveness, which is obtained by the use of performance profiles. Two computational effort reduction schemas, which significantly accelerate heuristics as well as optimal algorithms without increasing the value of the cost function, are also proposed. The presented experiments were done on a large dataset with special attention to the large problems, rarely considered in previous experiments. The main disadvantage of a greedy method indicated in literature was its long running time. The results of the conducted experiments show that the modification of the greedy algorithm together with the computational effort reduction schemas presented in this paper result in the method which finds a solution in short time, even for large lattices.

AB The Stand Allocation Problem (SAP) consists in assigning aircraft activities (arrival, departure and intermediate parking) to aircraft stands (parking positions) with the objective of maximizing the number of passengers/aircraft at contact stands and minimizing the number of towing movements, while respecting a set of operational and commercial requirements. We first prove that the problem of assigning each operation to a compatible stand is NP-complete by a reduction from the circular arc graph coloring problem. As a corollary, this implies that the SAP is NP-hard. We then formulate the SAP as a Mixed Integer Program (MIP) and strengthen the formulation in several ways. Additionally, we introduce two heuristic algorithms based on a spatial and time decomposition leading to smaller MIPs. The methods are tested on realistic scenarios based on actual data from two major European airports. We compare the performance and the quality of the solutions with state-of-the-art algorithms. The results show that our MIP-based methods provide significant improvements to the solutions outlined in previously published approaches. Moreover, their low computation makes them very practical.

AB Handling weather uncertainty during the harvest season is an indispensable aspect of seed gathering activities. More precisely, the focus of this study refers to the multi-period wheat quality control problem during the crop harvest season under meteorological uncertainty. In order to alleviate the problem curse of dimensionality and to reflect faithfully exogenous uncertainties revealed progressively over time, we propose a multi-step joint chance-constrained model rolled forward step-by-step. This model is subsequently solved by a proactive dynamic approach, specially conceived for this purpose. Based on real-world derived instances, the obtained computational results exhibit proactive and accurate harvest scheduling solutions for the wheat crop quality control problem.

The purpose of the contracts is to achieve the pointwise procurement of energy to the grid. The challenge raised by the coordination of scattered resources and the securing of obligations over the planning horizon is addressed through a twin-time scale model, where robust short term operational decisions are contingent on long term resource usage incentives that embed the full extent of contract specifications.

AB This study seeks to analyse the price determination of low cost airlines in Europe and the effect that Internet has on this strategy. The outcomes obtained reveal that both users and companies benefit from the use of ICTs in the purchase and sale of airline tickets: the Internet allows consumers to increase their bargaining power comparing different airlines and choosing the most competitive flight, while companies can easily check the behaviour of users to adapt their pricing strategies using internal information.
   More than 2500 flights of the largest European low cost airlines have been used to carry out the study. The study revealed that the most significant variables for understanding pricing strategies were the number of rivals, the behaviour of the demand and the associated costs. The results indicated that consumers should buy their tickets before 25 days prior to departure.

ID LINE MAINTENANCE; SIMULATION; OPTIMIZATION; PRICE
AB This paper presents a heuristic approach to optimize staffing and scheduling at an aircraft maintenance company. The goal is to build robust aircraft maintenance personnel rosters that can achieve a certain service level while minimizing the total labor costs. Robust personnel rosters are rosters that can handle delays associated with stochastic flight arrival times. To deal with this stochasticity, a model enhancement algorithm is proposed that iteratively adjusts a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model to a stochastic environment based on simulation results. We illustrate the performance of the algorithm with a computational experiment based on real life data of a large aircraft maintenance company located at Brussels Airport in Belgium. The obtained results are compared to deterministic optimization and straightforward optimization. Experiments demonstrate that our model can ensure a certain desired service level with an acceptable increase in labor costs when stochasticity is introduced in the aircraft arrival times.

AB Project scheduling problems with both resource constraints and uncertain task durations have applications in a variety of industries. While the existing research literature has been focusing on finding an a priori open-loop task sequence that minimizes the expected makespan, finding a dynamic and adaptive closed-loop policy has been regarded as being computationally intractable. In this research, we develop effective and efficient approximate dynamic programming (ADP) algorithms based on the rollout policy for this category of stochastic scheduling problems. To enhance performance of the rollout algorithm, we employ constraint programming (CP) to improve the performance of base policy offered by a priority-rule heuristic. We further devise a hybrid ADP framework that integrates both the look-back and look-ahead approximation architectures, to simultaneously achieve both the quality of a rollout (look-ahead) policy to sequentially improve a task sequence, and the efficiency of a lookup table (look-back) approach. Computational results on the benchmark instances show that our hybrid ADP algorithm is able to obtain competitive solutions with the state-of-the-art algorithms in reasonable computational time. It performs particularly well for instances with non-symmetric probability distribution of task durations.

AB This paper presents a biased random-key genetic algorithm (BRKGA) for the unequal area facility layout problem (UA-FLP) where a set of rectangular facilities with given area requirements has to be placed, without overlapping, on a rectangular floor space. The objective is to find the location and the dimensions of the facilities such that the sum of the weighted distances between the centroids of the facilities is minimized. A hybrid approach combining a BRKGA, to determine the order of placement and the dimensions of each facility, a novel placement strategy, to position each facility, and a linear programming model, to fine-tune the solutions, is developed. The proposed approach is tested on 100 random datasets and 28 of benchmark datasets taken from the literature and compared with 21 other benchmark approaches. The quality of the approach was validated by the improvement of the best known solutions for 19 of the 28 extensively studied benchmark datasets.

AB Interactive multiobjective optimization methods cannot necessarily be easily used when (industrial) multiobjective optimization problems are involved. There are at least two important factors to be considered with any interactive method: computationally expensive functions and aspects of human behavior. In this paper, we propose a method based on the existing NAUTILUS method and call it the Enhanced NAUTILUS (E-NAUTILUS) method. This method borrows the motivation of NAUTILUS along with the human aspects related to avoiding trading-off and anchoring bias and extends its applicability for computationally expensive multiobjective optimization problems. In the E-NAUTILUS method, a set of Pareto optimal solutions is calculated in a pre-processing stage before the decision maker is involved. When the decision maker interacts with the solution process in the interactive decision making stage, no new optimization problem is solved, thus, avoiding the waiting time for the decision maker to obtain new solutions according to her/his preferences. In this stage, starting from the worst possible objective function values, the decision maker is shown a set of points in the objective space, from which (s)he chooses one as the preferable point. At successive iterations, (s)he always sees points which improve all the objective values achieved by the previously chosen point. In this way, the decision maker remains focused on the solution process, as there is no loss in any objective function value between successive iterations. The last post-processing stage ensures the Pareto optimality of the final solution. A real-life engineering problem is used to demonstrate how E-NAUTILUS works in practice.

This approach improves the tractability of the problem by several orders of magnitude when compared with solving a classical 0-1 mixed-integer formulation over a set of computationally challenging instances. Central to the computational efficacy of the B&P algorithm is solving the column generation sub-problem as an elementary shortest path problem with aircraft time-windows and non-triangular separation times using an enhanced dynamic programming procedure. We underscore in our computational study the algorithmic features that contribute, in our experience, to accelerating the proposed dynamic programming procedure and, hence, the overall B&P algorithm.

AB This paper deals with the problem of finding the globally optimal subset of h elements from a larger set of n elements in d space dimensions so as to minimize a quadratic criterion, with an special emphasis on applications to computing the Least Trimmed Squares Estimator (LTSE) for robust regression. The computation of the LTSE is a challenging subset selection problem involving a nonlinear program with continuous and binary variables, linked in a highly nonlinear fashion. The selection of a globally optimal subset using the branch and bound (BB) algorithm is limited to problems in very low dimension, typically d,5 5, as the complexity of the problem increases exponentially with d. We introduce a bold pruning strategy in the BB algorithm that results in a significant reduction in computing time, at the price of a negligeable accuracy lost. The novelty of our algorithm is that the bounds at nodes of the BB tree come from pseudo-convexifications derived using a linearization technique with approximate bounds for the nonlinear terms. The approximate bounds are computed solving an auxiliary semidefinite optimization problem. We show through a computational study that our algorithm performs well in a wide set of the most difficult instances of the LTSE problem.

AB In this study, we investigate a two-dimensional cutting stock problem in the thin film transistor liquid crystal display industry. Given the lack of an efficient and effective mixed production method that can produce various sizes of liquid crystal display panels from a glass substrate sheet, thin film transistor liquid crystal display manufacturers have relied on the batch production method, which only produces one size of liquid crystal display panel from a single substrate. However, batch production is not an effective or flexible strategy because it increases production costs by using an excessive number of glass substrate sheets and causes wastage costs from unused liquid crystal display panels. A number of mixed production approaches or algorithms have been proposed. However, these approaches cannot solve industrial-scale two-dimensional cutting stock problem efficiently because of its computational complexity. We propose an efficient and effective genetic algorithm that incorporates a novel placement procedure, called a corner space algorithm, and a mixed integer programming model to resolve the problem. The key objectives are to reduce the total production costs and to satisfy the requirements of customers. Our computational results show that, in terms of solution quality and computation time, the proposed method significantly outperforms the existing approaches.

ID MODEL
AB The issues of carbon emission and global warming have increasingly aroused worldwide attention in recent years. Despite huge progresses in carbon abatement, few research studies have reported on the impacts of carbon emission reduction mechanisms on manufacturing optimisation, which often leads to decisions of environmentally unsustainable operations and misestimation of performance. This paper attempts to explore carbon management under the carbon emission trading mechanism for optimisation of lot sizing production planning in stochastic make-to-order manufacturing with the objective to maximise shareholder wealth. We are concerned not only about the economic benefits of investors, but also about the environmental impacts associated with production planning. Numerical experiments illustrate the significant influences of carbon emission trading, pricing, and caps on the dynamic decisions of the lot sizing policy. The result highlights the critical roles of carbon management in production planning for achieving both environmental and economic benefits. It also provides managerial insights into operations management to help mitigate environmental deterioration arising from carbon emission, as well as improve shareholder wealth.

We assume both products are perishable or prone to obsolescence, hence the firm faces a single period problem. The fundamental challenge facing the firm is to determine in advance of observing demand the profit maximizing inventory levels of both products that will meet given service level objectives. Note that while we speak of inventory levels, the products may be either goods or services. We characterize the firm's optimal inventory policy with and without customer service objectives. Results of a numerical study reveal the benefits obtained from substitution and show how optimal inventory levels are impacted by customer service objectives.

AB Ouyang et al. (2009) consider an economic order quantity (EOQ) model for deteriorating items with a partially permissible delay in payments linked to order quantity. Basically, their inventory model is practical, but there are some defects from the logical viewpoints of mathematics. In this paper, the functional behaviors of the annual total relevant costs are explored by rigorous methods of mathematics. A complete solution procedure is also developed to make up for the shortcomings of Ouyang et al. (2009). In numerical examples, it is proved that the new solution procedure could avoid making wrong decisions and causing cost penalties.

AB In this study, we focus on improving parameter estimation in Phase I study to construct more accurate Phase II control limits for monitoring multivariate quality characteristics. For a multivariate normal distribution with unknown mean vector, the usual mean estimator is known to be inadmissible under the squared error loss function when the dimension of the variables is greater than 2. Shrinkage estimators, such as the James-Stein estimators, are shown to have better performance than the conventional estimators in the literature. We utilize the James-Stein estimators to improve the Phase I parameter estimation. Multivariate control limits for the Phase II monitoring based on the improved estimators are proposed in this study. The resulting control charts, JS-type charts, are shown to have substantial performance improvement over the existing ones.

AB In this paper we consider the MMAP/PH/1 priority queue, both the case of preemptive resume and the case of non-preemptive service. The main idea of the presented analysis procedure is that the sojourn time of the low priority jobs in the preemptive case (and the waiting time distribution in the non-preemptive case) can be represented by the duration of the busy period of a special Markovian fluid model. By making use of the recent results on the busy period analysis of Markovian fluid models it is possible to calculate several queueing performance measures in an efficient way including the sojourn time distribution (both in the time domain and in the Laplace transform domain), the moments of the sojourn time, the generating function of the queue length, the queue length moments and the queue length probabilities.

AB Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is the most common nonparametric method for estimating the volatility structure of Gaussian interest rate models. One major difficulty in the estimation of these models is the fact that forward rate curves are not directly observable from the market so that non-trivial observational errors arise in any statistical analysis. In this work, we point out that the classical PCA analysis is not suitable for estimating factors of forward rate curves due to the presence of measurement errors induced by market microstructure effects and numerical interpolation. Our analysis indicates that the PCA based on the long-run covariance matrix is capable to extract the true covariance structure of the forward rate curves in the presence of observational errors. Moreover, it provides a significant reduction in the pricing errors due to noisy data typically found in forward rate curves.

AB Point Pattern Matching (PPM) is a task to pair up the points in two images of a same scene. There are many existing approaches in literature for point pattern matching. However, the drawback lies in the high complexity of the algorithms. To overcome this drawback, an Ant Colony Optimization based Binary Search Point Pattern Matching (ACOBSPPM) algorithm is proposed. According to this approach, the edges of the image are stored in the form of point patterns. To match an incoming image with the stored images, the ant agent chooses a point value in the incoming image point pattern and employs a binary search method to find a match with the point values in the stored image point pattern chosen for comparison. Once a match occurs, the ant agent finds a match for the next point value in the incoming image point pattern by searching between the matching position and maximum number of point values in the stored image point pattern. The stored image point pattern having the maximum number of matches is the image matching with the incoming image. Experimental results are shown to prove that ACOBSPPM algorithm is efficient when compared to the existing point pattern matching approaches in terms of time complexity and precision accuracy.

TI Revenue management under customer cancellations and overbooking
SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF OPERATIONAL RESEARCH

DT Article
DE Revenue management; Dynamic pricing; Customer choice models;
   Cancellations; Overbooking
ID MODEL; DECISIONS
AB In many application areas such as airlines and hotels a large number of bookings are typically cancelled. Explicitly taking into account cancellations creates an opportunity for increasing revenue. Motivated by this we propose a revenue management model based on Talluri and van Ryzin (2004) that takes cancellations into account in addition to customer choice behaviour. Moreover, we consider overbooking limits as these are influenced by cancellations. We model the problem as a Markov decision process and propose three dynamic programming formulations to solve the problem, each appropriate in a different setting. We show that in certain settings the problem can be solved exactly using a tractable solution method. For other settings we propose tractable heuristics, since the problem faces the curse of dimensionality. Numerical results show that the heuristics perform almost as good as the exact solution. However, the model without cancellations can lead to a revenue loss of up to 20 percent. Lastly we provide a parameter estimation method based on Newman et al. (2014). This estimation method is fast and provides good parameter estimates. The combination of the model, the tractable and well-performing solution methods, and the parameter estimation method ensures that the model can efficiently be applied in practice.

AB In an electric power system, demand fluctuations may result in significant ancillary cost to suppliers. Furthermore, in the near future, deep penetration of volatile renewable electricity generation is expected to exacerbate the variability of demand on conventional thermal generating units. We address this issue by explicitly modeling the ancillary cost associated with demand variability. We argue that a time-varying price equal to the suppliers' instantaneous marginal cost may not achieve social optimality, and that consumer demand fluctuations should be properly priced. We propose a dynamic pricing mechanism that explicitly encourages consumers to adapt their consumption so as to offset the variability of demand on conventional units. Through a dynamic game-theoretic formulation, we show that (under suitable convexity assumptions) the proposed pricing mechanism achieves social optimality asymptotically, as the number of consumers increases to infinity. Numerical results demonstrate that compared with marginal cost pricing, the proposed mechanism creates a stronger incentive for consumers to shift their peak load, and therefore has the potential to reduce the need for long-term investment in peaking plants.

AB The recently published equilibrium efficient frontier data envelopment analysis (EEFDEA) approach (Yang et al., 2014) represents a step forward in evaluating decision-making units (DMUs) with fixed-sum outputs when compared to prior approaches such as FSODEA (fixed-sum outputs DEA) approach (Yang et al., 2011) and ZSG-DEA (zero sum gains DEA) approach (Lins et al., 2003) and so on. Based on the EEFDEA approach, in this paper, we proposed a generalized equilibrium efficient frontier data envelopment analysis approach (GEEFDEA) which improves and strengthens the EEFDEA approach. Compared to EEFDEA approach, this approach makes several improvements in evaluation, namely that (1) it is not necessary to determine the evaluation order in advance, which overcomes the limitation that different evaluation orders will lead to different results; (2) the equilibrium efficient frontier can be achieved in only one step no matter how many DMUs they are, which greatly simplifies the procedure to reach the equilibrium efficient frontier especially when the number of DMUs is large; and (3) the constraint that signs of outputs' adjustment of each DMU must be same (all non-positive or all non-negative) in prior approaches has been relaxed. In this sense, the result obtained by the proposed approach is more consistent with the demand of practical applications. Finally, the proposed approach combined with assurance regions (AR) is applied to the data set of 2012 London Olympic Games.

DT Article
DE Forecasting; Sales response modeling; Heterogeneity; Functional
   flexibility; Expected profits
ID RESPONSE FUNCTIONS; MODEL; ELASTICITIES
AB We propose a hierarchical Bayesian semiparametric approach to account simultaneously for heterogeneity and functional flexibility in store sales models. To estimate own- and cross-price response flexibly, a Bayesian version of P-splines is used. Heterogeneity across stores is accommodated by embedding the semiparametric model into a hierarchical Bayesian framework that yields store-specific own- and cross-price response curves. More specifically, we propose multiplicative store-specific random effects that scale the nonlinear price curves while their overall shape is preserved. Estimation is fully Bayesian and based on novel MCMC techniques. In an empirical study, we demonstrate a higher predictive performance of our new flexible heterogeneous model over competing models that capture heterogeneity or functional flexibility only (or neither of them) for nearly all brands analyzed. In particular, allowing for heterogeneity in addition to functional flexibility can improve the predictive performance of a store sales model considerably, while incorporating heterogeneity alone only moderately improved or even decreased predictive validity. Taking into account model uncertainty, we show that the proposed model leads to higher expected profits as well as to materially different pricing recommendations.

TI Stowage planning for container ships: A heuristic algorithm to reduce
   the number of shifts
SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF OPERATIONAL RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
DE Stowage planning; Container movement; Shifts; Heuristic algorithm
AB We consider the stowage planning problem of a container ship, where the ship visits a series of ports sequentially and containers can only be accessed from the top of the stacks. At some ports, certain containers will be unloaded temporarily and will be loaded back later for various purposes. Such unproductive movements of containers are called shifts, which are both time and money consuming. Literature shows that binary linear programming formulation for such problems is impracticable for real life problems due to the large number of binary variables and constraints. Therefore, we develop a heuristic algorithm which can generate stowage plans with a reasonable number of shifts for such problems. The algorithm, verified by extensive computational experimentations, performs better than the Suspensory Heuristic Procedure (SH algorithm) proposed in Avriel et al. (1998), which, to the best of our knowledge, is one of the leading heuristic algorithms for such stowage planning problem.

TI On the estimation of the true demand in call centers with redials and
   reconnects
SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF OPERATIONAL RESEARCH

DE Queueing; Forecasting; Redials; Reconnects; Call centers
ID CENTER ARRIVALS; RETRIAL QUEUE; MODELS
AB In practice, in many call centers customers often perform redials (i.e., reattempt after an abandonment) and reconnects (i.e., reattempt after an answered call). In the literature, call center models usually do not cover these features, while real data analysis and simulation results show ignoring them inevitably leads to inaccurate estimation of the total inbound volume. Therefore, in this paper we propose a performance model that includes both features. In our model, the total volume consists of three types of calls: (1) fresh calls (i.e., initial call attempts), (2) redials, and (3) reconnects. In practice, the total volume is used to make forecasts, while according to the simulation results, this could lead to high forecast errors, and subsequently wrong staffing decisions. However, most of the call center data sets do not have customer-identity information, which makes it difficult to identify how many calls are fresh and what fractions of the calls are redials and reconnects. Motivated by this, we propose a model to estimate the number of fresh calls, and the redial and reconnect probabilities, using real call center data that has no customer-identity information. We show that these three variables cannot be estimated simultaneously. However, it is empirically shown that if one variable is given, the other two variables can be estimated accurately with relatively small bias. We show that our estimations of redial and reconnect probabilities and the number of fresh calls are close to the real ones, both via real data analysis and simulation.

TI Joint optimization for coordinated configuration of product families and

AB Product family design by module configuration is conducive to accommodating product variety while maintaining mass production efficiency. Effective fulfillment of product families necessitates joint decision making of product family configuration (PFC) and downstream supply chain configuration (SCC), due to nowadays manufacturers' moving towards assembly-to-order production throughout a distributed supply chain network. Existing decision models for joint optimization of product family and supply chain configuration are originated from an "all-in-one" approach that assumes both PFC and SCC decisions can be integrated into one optimization problem by aggregating two different types of objectives into a single objective function. Such an assumption neglects the complex tradeoffs underlying two different decision making problems and fails to reveal the inherent coupling of PFC and SCC.
   This paper formulates joint configuration of a product family and its supply chain as a leader-follower Stackelberg game that is enacted through a bi-level hierarchical optimization mechanism to model the coordination between two self-interested decision makers for PFC and SCC. The PFC decisions are modeled as an upper-level optimization problem (called leader) for optimal selection of modules, module instances, and product variants. The SCC decisions are modeled as a lower-level optimization problem (called follower), which responds to decisions of the upper level in order to determine an optimal supply chain configuration and inventory policies. A nonlinear, mixed integer programming model is formulated for the bi-level joint decision in the leader-follower game. To solve the nonlinear optimization model, a bi-level, nested genetic algorithm with constraint reasoning is developed and implemented. A case study of a power transformer product family and supply chain configuration is reported to demonstrate the feasibility and potential of the proposed leader-follower game-theoretic method.

AB The paper studies the incumbent-entrant problem in a fully dynamic setting. We find that under an open-loop information structure the incumbent anticipates entry by overinvesting, whereas in the Markov perfect equilibrium the incumbent slightly underinvests in the period before the entry. The entry cost level where entry accommodation passes into entry deterrence is lower in the Markov perfect equilibrium. Further we find that the incumbent's capital stock level needed to deter entry is hump shaped as a function of the entry time, whereas the corresponding entry cost, where the entrant is indifferent between entry and non-entry, is U-shaped.

AB Network operation and rehabilitation are major concerns for water utilities due to their impact on providing a reliable and efficient service. Solving the optimization problems that arise in water networks is challenging mainly due to the nonlinearities inherent in the physics and the often binary nature of decisions. In this paper, we consider the operational problem of pump scheduling and the design problem of leaky pipe replacement. New approaches for these problems based on simulation-optimization are proposed as solution methodologies. For the pump scheduling problem, a novel decomposition technique uses solutions from a simulation-based sub-problem to guide the search. For the leaky pipe replacement problem a knapsack-based heuristic is applied. The proposed solution algorithms are tested and detailed results for two networks from the literature are provided.

AB Camanho and Dyson (2005) extended Shephard's (1974) revenue-indirect cost efficiency approach to a cost-effectiveness framework, which helps to assess the ability of a firm to achieve the current revenue (expressed in the firm's own prices and quantities) at minimum cost. The degree of cost-effectiveness is quantified as the ratio of the minimum cost to the observed cost of the evaluated firm where the minimum cost is computed by simultaneously adjusting the output levels at the current revenue. In this paper, we develop two cost-effectiveness approaches based on convex data envelopment analysis and nonconvex free disposable hull technologies. The objectives of this paper are threefold. Firstly, we develop a convex cost-effectiveness (CCE) measure which is equivalent to the Camanho-Dyson CCE measure under the constant returns-to-scale assumption. Secondly, we introduce three nonconvex cost-effectiveness (NCCE) measures which are shown to be equivalent with respect to each returns-to-scale nonconvex technology. Finally, we apply our framework to a real data.

AB It is commonly accepted in the literature that, when facing with a strategic terrorist, the government can be better off by manipulating the terrorist's target selection with exposing her defense levels and thus moving first. However, the impact of terrorist's private information may significantly affect such government's first-mover advantage, which has not been extensively studied in the literature. To explore the impact of asymmetry in terrorist's attributes between government and terrorist on defense equilibrium, we propose a model in which the government chooses between disclosure (sequential game) and secrecy (simultaneous game) of her defense system. Our analysis shows that the government's first-mover advantage in a sequential game is considerable only when both government and terrorist share relatively similar valuation of targets. In contrast, we interestingly find that the government no longer benefits from the first-mover advantage by exposing her defense levels when the degree of divergence between government and terrorist valuation of targets is high. This is due to the robustness of defense system under secrecy, in the sense that all targets should be defended in equilibrium irrespective of how the terrorist valuation of targets is different to government. We identify two phenomena that lead to this result. First, when the terrorist holds a significantly higher valuation of targets than the government's belief, the government may waste her budget in a sequential game by over-investing on the high-valued targets. Second, when the terrorist holds a significantly lower valuation of targets, the government may incur a higher expected damage in a sequential game because of not defending the low-valued targets. Finally, we believe that this paper provides some novel insights to homeland security resource allocation problems.

ID PORTFOLIO SELECTION
AB One of the most important factors shaping world outcomes is where investment dollars are placed. In this regard, there is the rapidly growing area called sustainable investing where environmental, social, and corporate governance (ESG) measures are taken into account. With people interested in this type of investing rarely able to gain exposure to the area other than through a mutual fund, we study a cross section of U.S. mutual funds to assess the extent to which ESG measures are embedded in their portfolios. Our methodology makes heavy use of points on the nondominated surfaces of many tri-criterion portfolio selection problems in which sustainability is modeled, after risk and return, as a third criterion. With the mutual funds acting as a filter, the question is: How effective is the sustainable mutual fund industry in carrying out its charge? Our findings are that the industry has substantial leeway to increase the sustainability quotients of its portfolios at even no cost to risk and return, thus implying that the funds are unnecessarily falling short on the reasons why investors are investing in these funds in the first place.

Our model exploits stochastic dominance condition; and, we assume that the distribution of realized demand with higher stocking level stochastically dominates the distribution of realized demand with lower stocking level. We show that the critical fractile with endogenous demand may not exceed the critical fractile of the classical newsvendor model.

AB The single row layout problem (SRLP) consists of finding the most efficient arrangement of a given number of facilities or machines along one side of the material handling path, a topic that has enjoyed lasting interest for the past 45 years. As well as for use in manufacturing environments, the SRLP can serve to arrange rooms along a corridor in, e.g., hospitals and supermarkets. Besides its practical relevance, the problem is also interesting from a formal point of view due to its pip-hardness and therefore attracts the attention of many researchers. Beginning with the year 2000, this paper systematically reviews 82 articles focusing on single row layout problems. After featuring the relevance and timeliness, the SRLP is first positioned within the superordinate facility layout problem (FLP). Thereafter, the articles are classified according to topic of the paper, model formulation and representation, type of input data, objective function, and solution methods. We pay particular attention to recent developments in model formulation and solution methods to elaborate some possible directions and opportunities for further research. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

ID TRAVELING SALESMAN PROBLEM; SERVICE; PICKUP
AB Bicycle sharing systems can significantly reduce traffic, pollution, and the need for parking spaces in city centers. One of the keys to success for a bicycle sharing system is the efficiency of rebalancing operations, where the number of bicycles in each station has to be restored to its target value by a truck through pickup and delivery operations. The Static Bicycle Rebalancing Problem aims to determine a minimum cost sequence of stations to be visited by a single vehicle as well as the amount of bicycles to be collected or delivered at each station. Multiple visits to a station are allowed, as well as using stations as temporary storage. This paper presents an exact algorithm for the problem and results of computational tests on benchmark instances from the literature. The computational experiments show that instances with up to 60 stations can be solved to optimality within 2 hours of computing time. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ID CONTRACT DESIGN; WARRANTY; INFORMATION; LOGISTICS; MODELS; POLICY
AB When procuring a product from a supplier, a buyer faces the problem of designing a payment scheme to screen the supplier's quality level and cost. We explore an instalment payment (contract) consisting of an initial payment to the supplier as soon as the product is put in use, followed by a deferred payment that is contingent upon the product in normal operation within a certain period. We find that when the high quality supplier has a higher cost than the low quality supplier, and the suppliers' financing costs are lower than a certain threshold, the optimal instalment payment has two options: an initial-payment-only option preferred by the low quality supplier and a deferred-payment-only option preferred by the high quality supplier; otherwise, the optimal contract degenerates into an initial-payment-only option. Thus, our research complements past work on moral hazard where no initial payment is proposed. Moreover, we show that the buyer has an incentive to assist with the supplier's financing. Finally, we compare the instalment payment with the rental contract and show that when the supplier's financing cost is low or the quality difference among different supplier types is small, the rental contract is more likely to be preferred by the buyer than the instalment payment.

DE Decision analysis; Portfolio Decision Analysis; Multicriteria decision

ID RESOURCE-ALLOCATION
AB A common problem arising in many domains is how value the benefits of projects in a project portfolio. Recently, there has been some attention given to a decision analysis practice whereby analysts define a value function on some criterion by setting 0 as the value of the worst project. In particular, Clemen and Smith have argued this practice is not sound as it gives different results from the case where projects are "priced out", and makes a strong implicit assumption about the value of not doing a project. In this paper we underscore the criticism of this way of using value functions by showing it can lead to a rank reversal. We provide a measurement theoretic account of the phenomenon, showing that the problem arises from using evaluating projects on an interval scale (such as a value scale) whereas to guard against such rank reversals, benefits must be measured on at least a ratio scale. Seen from this perspective, we discuss how the solution proposed by Clemen and Smith, of reformulating the underlying optimisation problem to allow for explicitly non-zero values, addresses the issue, and explore in what sense it may be open to similar problems. In closing we discuss what lessons from practice may be drawn from this analysis, focussing on settings where the Clemen and Smith proposal may not be the most natural way of modelling.

AB In this paper we present an exact solution method for the transportation problem with piecewise linear costs. This problem is fundamental within supply chain management and is a straightforward extension of the fixed-charge transportation problem. We consider two Dantzig-Wolfe reformulations and investigate their relative strength with respect to the linear programming (LP) relaxation, both theoretical and practical, through tests on a number of instances. Based on one of the proposed formulations we derive an exact method by branching and adding generalized upper bound constraints from violated cover inequalities. The proposed solution method is tested on a set of randomly generated instances and compares favorably to solving the model using a standard formulation solved by a state-of-the-art commercial solver.

AB This paper deals with a discrete facility location model where service is provided at the facility sites. It is assumed that facilities can fail and customers do not have information on failures before reaching them. As a consequence, they may need to visit more than one facility, following an optimized search scheme, in order to get service. The goal of the problem is to locate p facilities in order to minimize the expected total travel cost. The paper presents two alternative mathematical programming formulations for this problem and proposes a matheuristic based on a network flow model to provide solutions to it. The computational burden of the presented formulations is tested and compared on a test-bed of instances. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The first heuristic is a variant of the variable neighborhood search and explores the k-neighbors of a feasible solution (in terms of binary variables) to find the extreme supported Pareto points. The second heuristic is adapted from the local branching method, which is well-known in single objective mixed 0-1 integer linear programming. Finally, an algorithm is proposed to find Pareto segments of outcome line segments of these heuristics. A computational analysis is performed by using some test problems from the literature and the results are presented. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB We present an algorithm based on an ant colony system to deal with a broad range of Dynamic Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problems with Time Windows, (partial) Split Delivery and Heterogeneous fleets (DVRPTWSD). We address the important case of responsiveness. Responsiveness is defined here as completing a delivery as soon as possible, within the time window, such that the client or the vehicle may restart its activities. We develop an interactive solution to allow dispatchers to take new information into account in real-time. The algorithm and its parametrization were tested on real and artificial instances. We first illustrate our approach with a problem submitted by Liege Airport, the 8th biggest cargo airport in Europe. The goal is to develop a decision system to optimize the journey of the refueling trucks. We then consider some classical VRP benchmarks with extensions to the responsiveness context.

AB Surgical scheduling is a challenging problem faced by hospital managers. It is subject to a wide range of constraints depending upon the particular situation within any given hospital. We deal with the simultaneous employment of specialised human resources, which must be assigned to surgeries according to their skills as well as the time windows of the staff. A particular feature is that they can be assigned to two surgeries simultaneously if the rooms are compatible. The objective is to maximise the use of the operating rooms. We propose an integer model and integer programming based heuristics to address the problem. Computational experiments were conducted on a number of scenarios inspired by real data to cover different practical problem solving situations. Numerical results show that relaxations provide tight upper bounds, and relax-and-fix heuristics are successful in finding optimal or near optimal solutions.

AB A number of factors are causing changes in container logistics, particularly for imports into the United States. These include growth and volatility in demands, expansion of new routes (Panama Canal and Northwest Passage), and development of new ports (Prince Rupert and ports on the Mexican west coast). Uncertainty is a major factor confronting logistics for container shipping. A stochastic network-flow model is developed in this study to analyze risk in port throughput as a result of randomness in critical variables in the logistics system for container imports into the United States. The results illustrate the stochastic distribution of container shipments at ports and routes serving the U.S. container market. The derived distributions for port throughput have important implications for port management.

AB Industrial practices and experiences highlight that demand is dynamic and non-stationary. Research however has historically taken the perspective that stochastic demand is stationary therefore limiting its impact for practitioners. Manufacturers require schedules for multiple products that decide the quantity to be produced over a required time span. This work investigated the challenges for production in the framework of a single manufacturing line with multiple products and varying demand. The nature of varying demand of numerous products lends itself naturally to an agile manufacturing approach. We propose a new algorithm that iteratively refines production windows and adds products. This algorithm controls parallel genetic algorithms (pGA) that find production schedules while minimizing costs. The configuration of such a pGA was essential in influencing the quality of results. In particular providing initial solutions was an important factor. Two novel methods are proposed that generate initial solutions by transforming a production schedule into one with refined production windows. The first method is called factorial generation and the second one fractional generation method. A case study compares the two methods and shows that the factorial method outperforms the fractional one in terms of costs. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ID NON-DOMINATED VECTORS; EFFICIENT; SET
AB Given a finite set N of feasible points of a multi-objective optimization (MOO) problem, the search region corresponds to the part of the objective space containing all the points that are not dominated by any point of N, i.e. the part of the objective space which may contain further nondominated points. In this paper, we consider a representation of the search region by a set of tight local upper bounds (in the minimization case) that can be derived from the points of N. Local upper bounds play an important role in methods for generating or approximating the nondominated set of an MOO problem, yet few works in the field of MOO address their efficient incremental determination. We relate this issue to the state of the art in computational geometry and provide several equivalent definitions of local upper bounds that are meaningful in MOO. We discuss the complexity of this representation in arbitrary dimension, which yields an improved upper bound on the number of solver calls in epsilon-constraint-like methods to generate the nondominated set of a discrete MOO problem. We analyze and enhance a first incremental approach which operates by eliminating redundancies among local upper bounds. We also study some properties of local upper bounds, especially concerning the issue of redundant local upper bounds, that give rise to a new incremental approach which avoids such redundancies. Finally, the complexities of the incremental approaches are compared from the theoretical and empirical points of view. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB It is well established that multiple reference sets may occur for a decision making unit (DMU) in the non-radial DEA (data envelopment analysis) setting. As our first contribution, we differentiate between three types of reference set. First, we introduce the notion of unary reference set (URS) corresponding to a given projection of an evaluated DMU. The URS includes efficient DMUs that are active in a specific convex combination producing the projection. Because of the occurrence of multiple URSs, we introduce the notion of maximal reference set (MRS) and define it as the union of all the URSs associated with the given projection. Since multiple projections may occur in non-radial DEA models, we further define the union of the MRSs associated with all the projections as unique global reference set (GRS) of the evaluated DMU. As the second contribution, we propose and substantiate a general linear programming (LP) based approach to identify the GRS. Since our approach makes the identification through the execution of a single primal-based LP model, it is computationally more efficient than the existing methods for its easy implementation in practical applications. Our last contribution is to measure returns to scale using a non-radial DEA model. This method effectively deals with the occurrence of multiple supporting hyperplanes arising either from multiplicity of projections or from non-full dimensionality of minimum face. Finally, an empirical analysis is conducted based on a real-life data set to demonstrate the ready applicability of our approach. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This paper develops a multi-stage optimization framework for determining periodic inspection intervals for geo-distributed infrastructure systems subject to hidden failures. We assume that the unit's failure can only be rectified at periodic inspection when a perfect repair is carried out to restore the unit to as-good-as-new condition. For large-scale systems such as fire hydrants in a city, water supply and power transformer distribution networks in urban areas, firstly, we partition the units of a system into groups based on their pre-specified features by a clustering algorithm; then compute an optimal periodic inspection interval for each group based on the expected cost per cycle; and finally, we find the inspection schedule for the whole system that not only minimizes the total inspection and maintenance cost but also satisfies the workforce and budget resource constraints. An integer nonlinear programming formulation and a heuristics are introduced to determine the inspection schedule. The proposed approach is applied to scheduling periodic inspection of large amounts of fire hydrants in a major U.S. city. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This paper considers a firm that introduces multiple generations of a product to the market at regular intervals. We assume that the firm has only a single production generation in the market at any time. To maximize the total profit within a given planning horizon, the firm needs to decide the optimal frequency to introduce new product generations, taking into account the trade-off between sales revenues and product development costs. We model the sales quantity of each generation as a function of the technical decay and installed base effects. We analytically examine the optimal frequency for introducing new product generations as a function of these parameters. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The purpose of this paper is to assess the business values of information technology (IT) and electronic commerce (EC) independently and simultaneously as measured by productive efficiency, in order to provide new insights into IT and EC investments and, consequently, lead to better decisions on IT and EC investments. The paper analyzes a panel data set at the country level based on the theory of production and its companions called the time-varying stochastic production frontier (SPF) approaches with the one-equation and two-equation models estimated by a two-step nonlinear maximum-likelihood method. The performance metric called productive efficiency is built in the research approaches. The empirical evidence strongly suggests that the presence of EC may strengthen or weaken IT value, and vice versa, which provide a good explanation for the disappearance or existence of the so-called productivity paradox, and that the paradox may exist in a country regardless of whether it is a developed or a developing country, inconsistent with conventional wisdom claiming that the paradox exists only in developing countries. The findings imply that it is imperative to carefully assess the values of IT and EC and, as such, prudent rather than blind IT and EC investing decisions are made; and that the values of IT and EC must be evaluated jointly rather than separately. The findings add significant contributions to the literature and serve as a catalytic agent in stimulating further comparative research in these important areas linking IT investments and EC developments when their business values are the major concern.

ID PORTFOLIO PERFORMANCE EVALUATION; SHARPE RATIO; SELECTION; STATISTICS
AB Within the class of performance ratios, the Sharpe measure can lead to misleading evaluation and various modifications have been investigated. As a starting point, we consider the axiomatic approach based on the notion of acceptable index of performance. Our goal is to show how the promising properties possessed by alternative measures such as the Gain-Loss ratio or the Average-Value-at-Risk ratio are not compatible with the statistical robustness of their estimated counterparts. This clearly affects the ranking of funds and consequently the performance persistence. We study the qualitative robustness along with the quantitative resistance of the corresponding estimators in a nonparametric setting. We include the Value-at-Risk ratio which is not an acceptability index of performance. These measures do not possess qualitative robustness, nonetheless we show how some degree of resistance to data contamination restricted to bounded intervals can be recovered. Using the relationship between the influence function of estimators and their bias for large samples, we suggest the Average-Value-at-Risk ratio and the Value-at-Risk ratio as the less sensitive to outliers. As a consequence, acceptability is no longer a prerequisite for performance evaluation. To limit the alteration of a given ranking among alternative investment funds, one can use the not acceptable Value-at-Risk ratio as well. Eventually, we propose a modified ratio either of the alpha-trimmed mean or of the median to the Value-at-Risk. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In this article we compare five alternative projects for the requalification of an abandoned quarry. The starting point for this paper was a request made by a decision maker. It was not for help in making a decision as such, but rather for a comparison of different projects. In particular, we are interested in ranking the considered projects on the basis of six different criteria. An extension of the ELECTRE III method with interactions between pairs of criteria was applied in the research. A focus group of experts (in economic evaluation, environmental engineering, and landscape ecology) was formed to be in charge of the process leading to the assignment of numerical values to the weights and interaction coefficients. We report on the way the process evolved and on the difficulties we encountered in obtaining consensual sets of values. Taking into account these difficulties, we considered other sets of weights and interaction coefficients. Our aim was also to study the impact on the final ranking of the fact that these numerical values, assigned to the parameters, were not perfectly defined. This allowed us to formulate robust conclusions which were presented to the members of the focus group.

AB The aim of this work is to present the practical applications of an integrated use of soft and hard methodologies applied in a case study of the Surgical Centre of the University Hospital Clementino Fraga Filho, where the low volume of surgeries is of major concern. The proposed approach is particularly appropriate in situations where there is limited time, financial resources, and institutional cooperation. Cognitive maps were used to elicit the perspectives of health professionals, which supported simulation experiments and guided the model's execution. Human-resource, patient-related, room-schedule, material, and structural constraints were found to affect the number of surgeries performed. The major contribution of this paper is the proposal of a multi-methodological approach with a committed focus on problem solving that incorporates specialists' views in simulation experiments; these specialists' collaborative work highlights actions that can lead to the resolution (or improvement) of real-world problems.

AB In this paper we present an efficient two-stage hierarchical decomposition algorithm aiming at determining economically improved operation schedules for residential proton exchange membrane fuel cell micro-combined heat and power (PEMFC micro-CHP) units and optimizing local charging of electric vehicles (EV) in the same household. Based on an individual short-term load forecasting (STLF) approach (imperfect forecast) for households implemented as an adaptive network-based fuzzy inference system (ANFIS), a mixed-integer linear program (MILP) and a two-stage greedy algorithm are used for determining optimized schedules based on a rolling-window approach. The results of the case study performed for eight variants in exemplary German households reveal that with both the MILP and the algorithmic approach, significant economic savings can be achieved compared to the standard heat-led strategy. Compared to the MILP, however, the two-stage algorithm has the additional advantage of a reduced computing time of only about Deviations from the MILP solutions are mostly smaller than 3 percent regarding the annual supply costs. Moreover, the comparison between the use of perfect and imperfect demand forecasts quantifies additional average losses due to forecasting errors of 2 percent and 3.3 percent at the maximum. Altogether, the algorithmic approach seems to be convincing for real applications in households due to its good results, high reliability, easy implementation, and short computing times. The combination of a micro-CHP unit and an EV is highly synergetic.

AB In this paper, we study the optimal procurement and operation of an oil refinery. The crude oil prices follow geometric Brownian motion processes with correlation. We build a multiperiod inventory problem where each period involves an operation problem such as separation or blending. The decisions are the amount of crude oils to purchase and the amount of oil products to produce. We employ approximate dynamic programming methods to solve this multiperiod multiproduct optimization problem. Numerical results reveal that this complex problem can be approximately solved with little loss of optimality. Further, we find that the approximate solution significantly outperforms a set of myopic policies that are currently used. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This paper discusses different models that can be used to construct composite indicators with both desirable and undesirable output indicators. Two approaches are considered. The first is an indirect approach, based on a traditional Data Envelopment Analysis model, requiring a prior transformation in the measurement scale of the undesirable outputs. The second is a direct approach, based on a directional distance function model. The use of a directional distance function allows for the accommodation of undesirable indicators in their original form. The main limitations of these approaches are discussed related to the data transformation in the case of the indirect approach and the possibility to obtain negative margin rates of substitution between the desirable and undesirable outputs in the case of the direct approach. These issues lead to the proposal of a new composite indicator model based on a directional distance function that overcomes the limitations associated with the existing approaches. The incorporation of information on the relative importance of individual indicators using weight restrictions is discussed. Proposed here is an enhanced formulation of weight restrictions, in the form of assurance regions type I, that reflects the relative importance of the indicators in percentage terms. The models are illustrated in the assessment of Brazilian hydropower plants and are suitable for any assessment involving the aggregation of key performance indicators whenever undesirable outputs are present.

AB The notion of imperfect maintenance has spawned a large body of literature, and many imperfect maintenance models have been developed. However, there is very little work on developing suitable imperfect maintenance-models for systems outfitted with sensors. Motivated by the practical need of such imperfect maintenance models, the broad objective of this paper is to propose an imperfect maintenance model that is applicable to systems whose sensor information can be modeled by stochastic processes. The proposed imperfect maintenance model is founded on the intuition that maintenance actions will change the rate of deterioration of a system, and that each maintenance action should have a different degree of impact on the rate of deterioration. The corresponding parameter-estimation problem can be divided into two parts: the estimation of fixed model parameters and the estimation of the impact of each maintenance action on the rate of deterioration. The quasi-Monte Carlo method is utilized for estimating fixed model parameters, and the filtering technique is utilized for dynamically estimating the impact from each maintenance action. The competence and robustness of the developed methods are evidenced via simulated data, and the utility of the proposed imperfect maintenance model is revealed via a real data set.

AB This paper presents an indicator-based multi-objective local search (IBMOLS) to solve a multi-objective optimization problem. The problem concerns the selection and scheduling of observations for an agile Earth observing satellite. The mission of an Earth observing satellite is to obtain photographs of the Earth surface to satisfy user requirements. Requests from several users have to be managed before transmitting an order, which is a sequence of selected acquisitions, to the satellite. The obtained sequence has to optimize two objectives under operation constraints. The objectives are to maximize the total profit of the selected acquisitions and simultaneously to ensure the fairness of resource sharing by minimizing the maximum profit difference between users. Experiments are conducted on realistic instances. Hypervolumes of the approximate Pareto fronts are computed and the results from IBMOLS are compared with the results from the biased random-key genetic algorithm (BRKGA). (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB There are many applications across a broad range of business problem domains in which equity is a concern and many well-known operational research (OR) problems such as knapsack, scheduling or assignment problems have been considered from an equity perspective. This shows that equity is both a technically interesting concept and a substantial practical concern. In this paper we review the operational research literature on inequity averse optimization. We focus on the cases where there is a tradeoff between efficiency and equity.
   We discuss two equity related concerns, namely equitability and balance. Equitability concerns are distinguished from balance concerns depending on whether an underlying anonymity assumption holds. From a modeling point of view, we classify three main approaches to handle equitability concerns: the first approach is based on a Rawlsian principle. The second approach uses an explicit inequality index in the mathematical model. The third approach uses equitable aggregation functions that can represent the DM's preferences, which take into account both efficiency and equity concerns. We also discuss the two main approaches to handle balance: the first approach is based on imbalance indicators, which measure deviation from a reference balanced solution. The second approach is based on scaling the distributions such that balance concerns turn into equitability concerns in the resulting distributions and then one of the approaches to handle equitability concerns can be applied.
   We briefly describe these approaches and provide a discussion of their advantages and disadvantages. We discuss future research directions focussing on decision support and robustness. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Generalized geometric programming (GGP) problems are converted to mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) problems using piecewise-linear approximations. Our approach is to approximate a multiple-term log-sum function of the form log(x(1) + x(2) + ... +x(n)) in terms of a set of linear equalities or inequalities of logx(1), logx(2), ... , and logx(n), where x(1,) ... , x(n), are strictly positive. The advantage of this approach is its simplicity and readiness to implement and solve using commercial MILP solvers. While MILP problems in general are no easier than GGP problems, this approach is justified by the phenomenal progress of computing power of both personal computers and commercial MILP solvers. The limitation of this approach is discussed along with numerical tests. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The improved primal simplex (IPS) was recently developed by Elhalaloui et al. to take advantage of degeneracy when solving linear programs with the primal simplex. It implements a dynamic constraint reduction based on the compatible columns, i.e., those that belong to the span of a given subset of basic columns including the nondegenerate ones. The identification of the compatible variables may however be computationally costly and a large number of linear programs are solved to enlarge the subset of basic variables. In this article, we first show how the positive edge criterion of Raymond et al. can be included in IPS for a fast identification of the compatible variables. Our algorithm then proceeds through a series of reduction and augmentation phases until optimality is reached. In a reduction phase, we identify compatible variables and focus on them to make quick progress toward optimality. During an augmentation phase, we compute one greatest normalized improving direction and select a subset of variables that should be considered in the reduced problem. Compared with IPS, the linear program that is solved to find this direction involves the data of the original constraint matrix. This new algorithm is tested over Mittelmann's benchmark for linear programming and on instances arising from industrial applications. The results show that the new algorithm outperforms the primal simplex of CPLEX on most highly degenerate instances in which a sufficient number of nonbasic variables are compatible. In contrast, IPS has difficulties on the eleven largest Mittelmann instances. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB We propose, in this paper, a new method to initialize the simplex algorithm. This approach does not involve any artificial variables. It can detect also the redundant constraints or infeasibility, if any. Generally, the basis found by this approach is not feasible. To achieve feasibility, this algorithm appeals to the nonfeasible basis method (NFB). Furthermore, we propose a new pivoting rule for NFB method, which shows to be beneficial in both numerical and time complexity. When solving a linear program, we develop an efficient criterion to decide in advance which algorithm between NFB and formal nonfeasible basis method seems to be more rapid. Comparative analysis is carried out with a set of standard test problems from Netlib. Our computational results indicate that the proposed algorithm is more advantageous than two-phase and perturbation algorithm in terms of number of iterations, number of involved variables, and also computational time.

AB In the Team Orienteering Arc Routing Problem (TOARP) the potential customers are located on the arcs of a directed graph and are to be chosen on the basis of an associated profit. A limited fleet of vehicles is available to serve the chosen customers. Each vehicle has to satisfy a maximum route duration constraint. The goal is to maximize the profit of the served customers. We propose a matheuristic for the TOARP and test it on a set of benchmark instances for which the optimal solution or an upper bound is known. The matheuristic finds the optimal solutions on all, except one, instances of one of the four classes of tested instances (with up to 27 vertices and 296 arcs). The average error on all instances for which the optimal solution is available is 0.67 percent. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Random simulations from complicated combinatorial sets are often needed in many classes of stochastic problems. This is particularly true in the analysis of complex networks, where researchers are usually interested in assessing whether an observed network feature is expected to be found within families of networks under some hypothesis (named conditional random networks, i.e., networks satisfying some linear constraints). This work presents procedures to generate networks with specified structural properties which rely on the Solution of classes of integer optimization problems. We show that, for many of them, the constraints matrices are totally unimodular, allowing the efficient generation of conditional random networks by specialized interior-point methods. The computational results suggest that the proposed methods can represent a general framework for the efficient generation of random networks even beyond the models analyzed in this paper. This work also opens the posSibility for other applications of mathematical programming in the analysis of complex networks. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Facing severe budgetary constraints, public transport companies are forced to efficiently manage staff, one of the most expensive resources.
   The driver rostering problem in a public transit company consists of defining rosters, that is, assigning daily crew duties to the company's drivers for a pre-defined time horizon, ensuring transport demand in a specific area, at low operating costs, while complying with legal restrictions and agreements between the company and the driver unions.
   The objective of this paper is the study of mathematical models and optimization techniques that lead to new computational tools able to solve the bus driver rostering problem with days-off patterns by producing solutions that increase efficiency and reduce operating costs, while improving or maintaining the service quality and balancing the drivers' workload.
   Three mixed integer linear programming formulations are presented and compared from a theoretical point of view: an assignment/cover model, a multi-commodity flow model and a new multi-commodity flow/assignment model.
   Based on a hierarchy of the decisions made during the resolution of the problem, a new decompose-and-fix heuristic is developed by exploring the underlying structure of the multi-commodity flow models. The heuristic solves the sequence of sub-problems identified by the hierarchy, while fixing or bounding the value of some variables to incorporate previous decisions.
   Computational experiments were carried out with instances, derived from real world data and from benchmark data, characterized by a days-off pattern in use at two Portuguese public bus transport companies. Computational results confirm the good performance of the decompose-and-fix heuristic. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In applications of data envelopment analysis (DEA) data about some inputs and outputs is often available only in the form of ratios such as averages and percentages. In this paper we provide a positive answer to the long-standing debate as to whether such data could be used in DEA. The problem arises from the fact that ratio measures generally do not satisfy the standard production assumptions, e.g., that the technology is a convex set. Our approach is based on the formulation of new production assumptions that explicitly account for ratio measures. This leads to the estimation of production technologies under variable and constant returns-to-scale assumptions in which both volume and ratio measures are native types of data. The resulting DEA models allow the use of ratio measures as is", without any transformation or use of the underlying volume measures. This provides theoretical foundations for the use of DEA in applications where important data are reported in the form of ratios. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This paper analyzes a capacity management problem in which two service providers utilize a common facility to serve two separate markets with time-sensitive demands. The facility provider has a fixed capacity and all parties maximize demand rates. When the service providers share the facility, they play a frequency competition game with a unique Nash equilibrium. When the service providers have dedicated facilities, the facility provider leads two separate Stackelberg games. A centralized system with the first-best outcome is also examined. Based on closed-form solutions under all three scenarios, we find that facility capacity competition is a prerequisite condition for not pooling the service providers. Moreover, we establish the rankings of preferred strategies for all parties with respect to the ratio of the service providers' demand loss rates, which are proportional to the time sensitivity of demand and the potential market size. Interestingly a triple-agreement situation for the pooling strategy exists if the rates are close, and the facility provider permits a request for dedicated facilities only if the service provider has an overwhelming dominance at the demand loss rate. We connect these managerial insights with strategic seaport capacity management. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The determination of security returns will be associated with the validity of the corresponding portfolio selection models. The complexity of real financial market inevitably leads to diversity of types of security returns. For example, they are considered as random variables when available data are enough, or they are considered as uncertain variables when lack of data. This paper is devoted to solving such a hybrid portfolio selection problem in the simultaneous presence of random and uncertain returns. The variances of portfolio returns are first given and proved based on uncertainty theory. Then the corresponding mean-variance models are introduced and the analytical solutions are obtained in the case with no more than two newly listed securities. In the general case, the proposed models can be effectively solved by Matlab and a numerical experiment is illustrated. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Railway capacity determination and expansion are very important topics. In prior research, the competition between different entities such as train services and train types, on different network corridors however have been ignored, poorly modelled, or else assumed to be static. In response, a comprehensive set of multi-objective models have been formulated in this article to perform a trade-off analysis. These models determine the total absolute capacity of railway networks as the most equitable solution according to a clearly defined set of competing objectives. The models also perform a sensitivity analysis of capacity with respect to those competing objectives. The models have been extensively tested on a case study and their significant worth is shown. The models were solved using a variety of techniques however an adaptive E constraint method was shown to be most superior. In order to identify only the best solution, a Simulated Annealing meta-heuristic was implemented and tested. However a linearization technique based upon separable programming was also developed and shown to be superior in terms of solution quality but far less in terms of computational time.

AB Maintenance scheduling for high value assets has been studied for decades and is still a crucial area of research with new technological advancements. The main dilemma of maintenance scheduling is to avoid failures while preventing unnecessary maintenance. The technological advancements in real time monitoring and computational science make tracking asset health and forecasting asset failures possible. The usage and maintenance of assets can be planned more efficiently with the forecasted failure probability and remaining useful life (i.e., prognostic information). The prognostic information is time sensitive. Geographically distributed assets such as off-shore wind farms and railway switches add another complexity to the maintenance scheduling problem with the required time of travel to reach these assets. Thus, the travel time between geographically distributed assets should be incorporated in the maintenance scheduling when one technician (or team) is responsible for the maintenance of multiple assets. This paper presents a methodology to schedule the maintenance of geographically distributed assets using their prognostic information. Genetic Algorithm based solution incorporating the daily work duration of the maintenance team is also presented in the paper. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Retailers often conduct sequential, single-unit auctions and need to decide the minimum bid in each auction. To reduce inventory costs, it may be optimal to scrap some of the inventory rather than holding it until it is auctioned off. In some auctions, the seller may be uncertain about the market response and hence may want to dynamically learn the demand by observing the number of posted bids. We formulate a Markov decision process (MDP) to study this dynamic auction-design problem under the Vickrey mechanism.
   We first develop a clairvoyant model where the seller knows the demand distribution. We prove that it is optimal to scrap all inventory above a certain threshold and then auction the remaining units. We derive a first order necessary condition whereby the bidders' virtual value at an optimal minimum bid equals the seller's marginal profit. This is a generalization of Riley and Samuelson's result from the one, single-unit auction case. When the virtual value is strictly increasing, this necessary condition is also sufficient and leads to a structured value iteration algorithm.
   We then assume that the number of bidders is Poisson distributed but the seller does not know its mean. The seller uses a mixture-of-Gamma prior on this mean and updates this belief over several auctions. This results in a high-dimensional Bayesian MDP whose exact solution is intractable. We therefore propose and compare two approximation methods called certainty equivalent control (CEC) and Q-function approximation. Numerical experiments suggest that Q-function approximation can attain higher revenues than CEC. (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB This paper examines variance swap pricing using a model that integrates three major features of financial assets, namely the mean reversion in asset price, multi-factor stochastic volatility (SV) and simultaneous jumps in prices and volatility factors. Closed-form solutions are derived for vanilla variance swaps and gamma swaps while the solutions for corridor variance swaps and conditional variance swaps are expressed in a one-dimensional Fourier integral. The numerical tests confirm that the derived solution is accurate and efficient. Furthermore, empirical studies have shown that multi-factor SV models better capture the implied volatility surface from option data. The empirical results of this paper also show that the additional volatility factor contributes significantly to the price of variance swaps. Hence, the results favor multi-factor SV models for pricing variance swaps consistent with the implied volatility surface. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Crop rotation plays an important role in agricultural production models with sustainability considerations. Commonly associated strategies include the alternation of botanical families in the plots, the use of fallow periods and the inclusion of green manure crops. In this article, we address the problem of scheduling vegetable production in this context. Vegetables crop farmers usually manage a large number of crop species with different planting periods and growing times. These crops present multiple and varied harvesting periods and productivities. The combination of such characteristics makes the generation of good vegetable crop rotation schedules a hard combinatorial task. We approach this problem while considering two additional important practical aspects: standard plot sizes (multiples of a base area) and total area minimisation. We propose an integer programming formulation for this problem and develop a branch-price-and-cut algorithm that includes several performance-enhancing characteristics, such as the inclusion of a family of subadditive valid inequalities, two primal heuristics and a strong branching rule. Extensive computational experiments over a set of instances based on real-life data validate the efficiency and robustness of the proposed method. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB An economic measure of scale efficiency is the ratio of the minimum average cost to the average cost at the actual output level of a firm. It is easily measured by the ratio of the total cost of this output under the constant and variable returns to scale assumptions. This procedure does not identify the output level where the average cost reaches a minimum. This paper proposes a nonparametric method of measuring this output level using DEA. The relation between this efficient production scale, the short run physical capacity output, and the most productive scale size (MPSS) is also discussed. An empirical application using state level data from U.S. manufacturing is used to illustrate the procedure. The DEA findings are further analyzed using a smoothed bootstrap procedure.

AB This paper analyses farming efficiency by the means of the partial frontiers and Multi-Directional Efficiency Analysis (MEA). In particular, we apply the idea of the conditional efficiency framework to the MEA approach to ensure that observations are compared to their homogeneous counterparts. Moreover, this paper shows that combining the traditional one-directional and multi-directional efficiency framework yields valuable insights. It allows one to identify what factors matter in terms of output production and input consumption. The application deals with Lithuanian family farms, for which we have a rich dataset. The results indicate that the output efficiency positively correlates to a time trend and negatively to the subsidy share in the total output. The MEA-based analysis further suggests that the time trend has been positively affecting the productive efficiency due to increase in the labour use efficiency. Meanwhile, the increasing subsidy rate has a negative influence upon MEA efficiencies associated with all the inputs. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Existing models studying demand variability's impact use either stochastic ordering techniques or use variance as a measure of uncertainty. Due to both axiomatic appeal and recent use of entropy in the operations management literature, this paper develops entropy's use as a demand uncertainty measure. Our key contribution is an insightful proof quantifying how costs are non-increasing when entropy is reduced. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In this study, a mobile blood collection system is designed with the primary objective of increasing blood collection levels. This design also takes into account operational costs to aim for collection of large amounts of blood at reasonable cost. Bloodmobiles perform direct tours to certain activities to collect blood, but at the end of each day, they bring the collected blood to a designated depot to prevent its spoilage. The proposed system consists of the bloodmobiles and a new vehicle called the shuttle that visits the bloodmobiles in the field on each day and transfers the collected blood to the depot. Consequently, bloodmobiles can continue their tours without having to make daily returns to the depot.
   We propose a mathematical model and a 2-stage IP based heuristic algorithm to determine the tours of the bloodmobiles and the shuttle, and their lengths of stay at each stop. This new problem is defined as an extension of the Selective Vehicle Routing Problem and is referred to as the SVRP with Integrated Tours. The performances of the solution methodologies are tested first on a real data set obtained from past blood donation activities of Turkish Red Crescent in Ankara, and then on a constructed data set based on GIS data of the European part of Istanbul. The Pareto set of optimum solutions is generated based on blood amounts and logistics costs, and finally a sensitivity analysis on some important design parameters is conducted.

AB The flexible job shop scheduling is a challenging problem due to its high complexity and the huge number of applications it has in real production environments. In this paper, we propose effective neighborhood structures for this problem, including feasibility and non improving conditions, as well as procedures for fast estimation of the neighbors quality. These neighborhoods are embedded into a scatter search algorithm which uses tabu search and path relinking in its core. To develop these metaheuristics we define a novel dissimilarity measure, which deals with flexibility. We conducted an experimental study to analyze the proposed algorithm and to compare it with the state of the art on standard benchmarks. In this study, our algorithm compared favorably to other methods and established new upper bounds for a number of instances. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ID PROJECT SCHEDULING PROBLEM; OPTIMIZATION; SOFTWARE
AB We propose a new mixed integer programming formulation and solution algorithm for a multi-mode resource-constrained project scheduling problem with availability constraints (calendars) and the objective to minimize the resource availability cost. Our model exploits the problem structure and has an exponential number of variables, which necessitates a column generation approach. The linear programming relaxation is strengthened by adding valid inequalities that need to be carefully separated in order to show the desired effect. Integer optimal solutions are obtained by an exact state-of-the-art branch-price-and-cut algorithm. Classical time-indexed mixed integer programming formulations for similar problems quite often fail already on instances with only 30 jobs, depending on the network complexity and the total freedom of arranging jobs. A reason is the typically very weak linear programming relaxation. Our model can be interpreted as a non-trivial Dantzig-Wolfe reformulation of a time-indexed formulation. In particular, for larger instances our reformulation gives significantly tighter dual bounds, enabling us to optimally solve instances with 50 multi-mode jobs. This outperforms the classical formulation by far. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In this paper, we propose the Electric Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows and Mixed Fleet (E-VRPTWMF) to optimize the routing of a mixed fleet of electric commercial vehicles (ECVs) and conventional internal combustion commercial vehicles (ICCVs). Contrary to existing routing models for ECVs, which assume energy consumption to be a linear function of traveled distance, we utilize a realistic energy consumption model that incorporates speed, gradient and cargo load distribution. This is highly relevant in the context of ECVs because energy consumption determines the maximal driving range of ECVs and the recharging times at stations. To address the problem, we develop an Adaptive Large Neighborhood Search algorithm that is enhanced by a local search for intensification. In numerical studies on newly designed E-VRPTWMF test instances, we investigate the effect of considering the actual load distribution on the structure and quality of the generated solutions. Moreover, we study the influence of different objective functions on solution attributes and on the contribution of ECVs to the overall routing costs. Finally, we demonstrate the performance of the developed algorithm on benchmark instances of the related problems VRPTW and E-VRPTW. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In this paper, we suggest a new multi-objective artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm by introducing an elitism strategy. The algorithm uses a fixed-size archive that is maintained based on crowding-distance to store non-dominated solutions found during-the search process. In the proposed algorithm, an improved artificial bee colony algorithm with an elitism strategy is adopted for the purpose of avoiding premature convergence. Specifically, the elites in the archive are selected and used to generate new food sources in both employed and onlooker bee phases in each cycle. To keep diversity, a member located at the most crowded region will be removed when the archive overflows. The algorithm is very easy to be implemented and it employs only a few control parameters. The proposed algorithm is tested on a wide range of multi-objective problems, and compared with other state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of often-used quality indicators with the help of a nonparametric test. It is revealed by the test procedure that the algorithm produces better or comparable results when compared with other well-known algorithms, and it can be used as a promising alternative tool to solve multi-objective problems with the advantage of being simple and effective.

AB The complex multi-attribute large-group decision-making problems that are based on interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy information have become a common topic of research in the field of decision-making. Due to the complexity of this kind of problem, alternatives are usually described by multiple attributes that exhibit a high degree of interdependence or interactivity. In addition, decision makers tend to be derived from different interest groups, which cause the assumption of independence between the decision maker preferences in the same interest group to be violated. Because traditional aggregation operators are proposed based on the independence axiom, directly applying these operators to the information aggregation process in the complex multi-attribute large-group decision-making problem is not appropriate. Although these operators can obtain the overall evaluation value of each alternative, the results may be biased. Therefore, we draw the thought from the conventional principal component analysis model and propose the interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy principal component analysis model. Based on this new model, we provide a decision-making method for the complex multi-attribute large-group decision-making problem. First, we treat the attributes and the decision makers as interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy variables, and we transform these two types of variables into several independent variables using the proposed principal component analysis model. We then obtain each alternative's overall evaluation value by utilizing conventional information aggregation operators. Moreover, we obtain the optimal alternative(s) based on the ranks of the alternative overall evaluation values. An illustrative example is provided to demonstrate the proposed technique and evaluate its feasibility and validity. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB High logistics and handling costs prevent the bioenergy industry from making a greater contribution to the present energy market. Therefore, a mathematical model, OPTIMASS, is presented to optimise strategic (e.g. facility location and type) and tactical (e.g. allocation) decisions in all kinds of biomass-based supply chains. In addition to existing models, OPTIMASS evaluates changes in biomass characteristics due to handling operations which is needed to meet the requirements set to biomass products delivered at a conversion facility. Also, OPTIMASS considers the re-injection of by-products from conversion facilities which can play a decisive role in the determination of a sustainable supply chain.
   The scenario analysis illustrates the functionalities of OPTIMASS in the optimisation of an existing supply chain, the definition of the optimal location of new conversion facilities and the definition of the optimal configuration of a supply chain. OPTI1VIASS, as a deterministic model, does not consider variability related to e.g. seasonal changes which can be a major obstacle. However, a thorough sensitivity analysis of influencing factors must give insight in the induced changes in the supply chain. The sensitivity analysis in this paper investigates the influence of uncertainty in biomass production, energy demand and of changes in transport distance. The analysis demonstrates that OPTIMASS can be used as an inspiring tool to investigate the possible effects of governmental decisions, of considering new biomass material, new facilities, of technology changes, etc. The coupling with GIS allows characterisation and visualisation of problems in advance and visualisation of results in an interpretative way.

A medium and long term planning problem decomposes into thousands of single period (hourly) subproblems and dynamic constraints can usually be ignored in this context. The hourly subproblem can be formulated as a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model. First, an efficient two phase approach for constructing the Pareto Frontier (PF) of the hourly subproblem is presented. Then a merging algorithm is developed to approximate the PF for the multi-period planning problem. Numerical results with real CHP plants demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the solution approach using the CPLEX based epsilon-constraint method as benchmark. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB This paper presents a model and solution methodology for scheduling patients in a multi-class, multi-resource surgical system. Specifically, given a master schedule that provides a cyclic breakdown of total OR availability into specific daily allocations to each surgical specialty, the model provides a scheduling policy for all surgeries that minimizes a combination of the lead time between patient request and surgery date, overtime in the operating room and congestion in the wards. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first to determine a surgical schedule based on making efficient use of both the operating rooms and the recovery beds. Such a problem can be formulated as Markov Decision Process model but the size of any realistic problem makes traditional solution methods intractable. We develop a version of the Least Squares Approximate Policy Iteration algorithm and test our model on data from a local hospital to demonstrate the success of the resulting policy.

AB Firms maintain a capital charge to manage the risk of low-frequency, high-impact operational disruptions. The loss distribution approach (LDA) measures the capital charge using two inputs: the frequency and severity of operational disruptions. In this study, we investigate whether or not capital charge could be combined with process improvement, an approach predominantly employed for managing high-frequency, low-impact operational disruptions. Using the categorization of events defined by the Basel Accord for different types of operational risk events, we verify three propositions. First, we test whether classification of operational disruptions is warranted to manage the risk. Second, we posit that classification of operational disruptions will display different statistical properties in manufacturing and in the financial services sector. Finally, we test whether risk of operational disruptions can be managed through a combination of process improvement and capital adequacy. We obtained data on 5442 operational disruptions and ran Monte Carlo simulations spanning both these sectors and seven event types. The results reveal that process improvement can be a first line of defense to manage certain types of operational risk events. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This paper argues that if OR is to prosper it needs to more closely reflect the needs of organisations and its practitioners. Past research has highlighted a gap between theoretical research developments, applications and the methods most frequently used in organisations. The scope of OR applications has also been contested with arguments as to the expanding boundaries of OR. But despite this, anecdotal evidence suggests that OR has become marginalised in many contexts. In order to understand these changes, IFORS (International Federation of OR Societies) in 2009 sponsored a survey of global OR practice. The aim was to provide current evidence on the usage of OR tools, areas of application, and the,barriers to OR's uptake, as well as the educational background of OR practitioners. Results presented here show practitioners falling into three segments, which can be loosely characterised as those practicing 'traditional' OR, those adopting a range of softer techniques including Problem Structuring Methods (PSMs), and a Business Analytics cluster. When combined with other recent survey evidence, the use of PSMs and Business Analytics is apparently extending the scope of OR practice. In particular, the paper considers whether the Business Analytics movement, with an overlapping skill set to traditional OR but with a fast growing organisational base, offers a route to diminishing the gap between academic research and practice. The paper concludes with an exploration of whether this represents not just an opportunity for OR but also a serious challenge to its established practices. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB Cluster analysis refers to finding subsets of vertices of a graph (called clusters) which are more likely to be joined pairwise than vertices in different clusters. In the last years this topic has been studied by many researchers, and several methods have been proposed. One of the most popular is to maximize the modularity, which represents the fraction of edges within clusters minus the expected fraction of such edges in a random graph with the same degree distribution. However, this criterion presents some issues, for example the resolution limit, i.e., the difficulty to detect clusters having small sizes. In this paper we focus on a recent measure, called modularity density, which improves the resolution limit issue of modularity. The problem of maximizing the modularity density can be described by means of a 0-1 NLP formulation. We derive some properties of the optimal solution which will be used to tighten the formulation, and we propose some MILP reformulations which yield an improvement of the resolution time.

AB This paper is concerned with the Multi-Row Facility Layout Problem. Given a set of rectangular departments, a fixed number of rows, and weights for each pair of departments, the problem consists of finding an assignment of departments to rows and the positions of the departments in each row so that the total weighted sum of the center-to-center distances between all pairs of departments is minimized. We show how to extend our recent approach for the Space-Free Multi-Row Facility Layout Problem to general Multi-Row Facility Layout as well as some special cases thereof. To the best of our knowledge this is the first global optimization approach for multi-row layout that is applicable beyond the double-row case. A key aspect of our proposed approach is a model for multi-row layout that expresses the problem as a discrete optimization problem, and thus makes it possible to exploit the underlying combinatorial structure. In particular we can explicitly control the number and size of the spaces between departments. We construct a semidefinite relaxation of the discrete optimization formulation and present computational results showing that the proposed approach gives promising results for several variants of multi-row layout problems on a variety of benchmark instances.

AB The Steiner Travelling Salesman Problem (STSP) is a variant of the TSP that is suitable for instances defined on road networks. We consider an extension of the STSP in which the road traversal costs are both stochastic and correlated. This happens, for example, when vehicles are prone to delays due to rush hours, road Works or accidents. Following the work of Markowitz on portfolio selection, we model this problem as a bi-objettive mean-variance problem. Then, we show how to approximate the efficient frontier via integer programming. We also show how to exploit certain special structures in the correlation matrices. Computational results indicate that our approach is viable for instances with up to 100 nodes. It turns out that minimum variance tours can look rather different from minimum expected cost tours. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB We develop a model for optimal location of retail stores on a network. The objective is to maximize the total profit of the network subject to a minimum ROI (or ROI threshold) required at each store. Our model determines the location and number of stores, allocation of demands to the stores, and total investment. We formulate a store's profit as a jointly concave function in demand and investment, and show that the corresponding ROI function is unimodal. We demonstrate an application of our model to location of retail stores operating as an M/M/1/K queue and show the joint concavity of a store's profit. To this end, we prove the joint concavity of the throughput of an M/M/1/K queue. Parametric analysis is performed on an illustrative example for managerial implications. We introduce an upper bound of an optimal value of the problem and develop three heuristic algorithms based on the structural properties of the profit and ROI functions. Computational results are promising. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB We investigate a periodic-review inventory system for a single item with stochastic demand and random yield. Since the optimal policy for such a system is complicated, we study the class of stationary linear-inflation policies where orders are only placed if the inventory position is below a critical stock level, and where the order quantity is controlled by a yield inflation factor. We consider two different models for the uncertain supply, namely binomial and stochastically proportional yield, and we allow positive and constant lead times as well as asymmetric demand and yield distributions. In this paper we propose two novel approaches to derive optimal and near-optimal numerical values for the critical stock level, minimizing the average holding and backorder cost for a given inflation factor. First, we present a Markov chain approach which is exact in case of negligible lead time. Second, we provide a steady-state analysis to derive approximate closed-form expressions for the optimal critical stock level. We conduct an extensive numerical study to test the performance of our approaches. The numerical experiments reveal an excellent performance of both approaches. Since our derived formulas are easily implementable and highly accurate they are very valuable for practical application. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The paper studies the impact of a green supplier's overconfidence on inventory decisions in a supply chain consisting of a supplier facing effort-dependent stochastic demand and a rational retailer. The overconfident supplier may overestimate the product demand due to carbon-reduction green efforts or underestimate the variability of the stochastic demand. We characterize these two kinds of overconfidence as ability-based and precision-based overconfidence, for which we develop optimal models for three supply chain systems: integrated, vendor managed inventory, and retailer managed inventory. Extensive comparative studies are conducted to highlight the impacts of supplier's overconfidence on the inventory decisions and on different green-supply chain performance measures. We find that, under certain conditions, supplier's overconfidence prompts the supplier to exert more efforts on green manufacturing, and enhances the profits of the retailer and of the entire supply chain. Managerial insights are provided for various scenarios and propositions. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB We examine the intertemporal and decentralization effects on managing disruption risks in a supply chain with lost sales and fixed transportation cost. The disruption risk is continuously monitored via collaborative forecasting based on advance supply signals-such as financial health and operational viability. We first develop a Markov model to capture the nonstationary, volatile, and dynamic nature of the forecast evolution. We then integrate the forecast into a dynamic programming for inventory hedging under three hierarchies. We derive an easy-to-implement coordination contract and a simple policy structure that facilitates ex ante strategic planning and ex post dynamic execution. The optimal strategy is driven by properly balanced adaptiveness, resilience and intertemporal imperatives. It outperforms the conventional inventory hedging and lean management by reducing premature inventory holding in good times, and timely ramping up safety stock ahead of looming disruptions. The proposed subsidy contract can effectively address double marginalization and information concealment problems via risk sharing, power preserving, and Pareto improving. We show that dynamic forecast is valuable for high margin products, moderate fixed cost, and low demand volatility. Without coordination, mandating supply information sharing can exacerbate supply disruptions. The three instruments are strategic complements and most effective when deployed jointly. This research highlights the importance of integrating forecast, inventory, and contract instruments in managing supply risk dynamically. It also explains two rationales-the resilience and information imperatives-behind recent trends of onshoring and vertical integration. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This paper introduces a novel two-phase supplier selection procedure. Unlike most supplier selection researches, which are decisive based on supplier eligibility at the time of the decision making, the proposed method is based on the long term trend of value, stability, and relationship of potential suppliers. In the first phase, suppliers are evaluated and assigned a comparable value based on a set of criteria. This value is then analyzed in the long run, and fed into a multi-objective portfolio optimization model in the second phase. The model determines a supplier portfolio by maximizing the expected value and development of suppliers, and minimizing their correlated risk. The novelty of this procedure is introducing a new view toward the supplier selection problem. Numerical tests show that the proposed approach selects higher value suppliers with lower risk of failure, compared to available methods. (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier B.V.

ID RANDOM NETWORKS; MODEL; MOUTH; WORD
AB When introducing a new product into market, substantial amounts of resources are put at stake. Innovation managers therefore seek for reliable predictions of the respective innovation diffusion process. Making such predictions, however, is challenging, because the diffusion trajectory is affected by various factors such as the type of innovation, its perceived attributes, marketing activities and their impact, or consumers' individual communication and adoption behaviors. Modeling the diffusion of innovations accordingly is of interest for both practitioners and management scholars.
   An agent-based model can overcome many limitations of traditional approaches. It accounts for heterogeneity in consumer preferences as well as in the social structure of their interactions and allows for modeling consumers as boundedly rational agents who make decisions under uncertainty and are influenced by micro-level drivers of adoption. We introduce an agent-based model that deals with repeat purchase decisions, addresses the competitive diffusion of multiple products, and takes into consideration both the temporal and the spatial dimension of innovation diffusion. The corresponding simulation tool can support decision makers in analyzing the prospective diffusion of an innovation in scenarios that differ in pricing strategy, distribution strategy, and/or communication strategy. Its applicability is illustrated by means of an empirically grounded example for a second-generation biofuel. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The model decomposes inefficiency into firm and time-specific components and productivity change into inefficiency change, technical change and scale change. We then apply the proposed methodology to the Norwegian salmon production data and analyze technical efficiency as well as productivity changes. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Congestion is a widely observed economic phenomenon where outputs are reduced due to excessive amount of inputs. The previous approaches to identify congestion in nonparametric analysis only consider desirable outputs. In the production process, undesirable outputs are usually jointly produced with desirable outputs. In this paper, we propose an approach for measuring congestion in the presence of desirable and undesirable outputs simultaneously. The proposed approach can discriminate between the congested DMUs and the truly efficient DMUs, which are all efficient according to the scores calculated by the directional distance function. Finally, an empirical example is used to illustrate the approach. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ID PRINCIPAL-AGENT PROBLEMS; 1ST-ORDER APPROACH; COMPETITION; PRICE; COST
AB The main aim of this paper is to measure the social welfare loss for a continuous moral hazard model when a set of minimal assumptions are fulfilled. By using a new approach, we are able to reproduce the results of Balmaceda, Balseiro, Correa, and Stier-Moses (2010) pertaining to the social welfare loss for discrete and continuous models respectively. Previous studies rely on the validity of the first-order approach at the expense of strong assumptions, in particular the convexity of the distribution function condition while we do not make such a restrictive assumption in our developments. In addition, we obtain new bounds for the social welfare loss that are both tight and easy to compute. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This paper analyzes technical efficiency and the value of the marginal product of productive inputs vis-a-vis pesticide use to measure allocative efficiency of pesticide use along productive inputs. We employ the data envelopment analysis framework and marginal cost techniques to estimate technical efficiency and the shadow values of each input. A bootstrap technique is applied to overcome the limitations of DEA and helps to estimate the mean and 95 percent confidence intervals of the estimated quantities. The methods are applied to a sample of vegetable producers in Benin over the period 2009-2010. Results indicated that bias corrected technical efficiency scores are lower than the initial measures and the former estimates are statistically significant. The application results show that vegetable producers are less efficient with respect to pesticide use than other inputs. Also, results suggest that pesticides, land and fertilizers are overused.

AB The British government is implementing fully its novel Electricity Market Reform (GB EMR). Its objective, in line with European directives, aims at replacing existing nuclear and coal plant with low-carbon systems, to deliver reliable and affordable power. Though the GB EMR has proposed several policy instruments for meeting its objectives, and the academic literature has discussed the main issues, no known report includes a comprehensive and dynamic simulation exercise that assesses the extent of this profound and important initiative. This paper presents a system dynamics model that supports analysis of long-term effects of the various policy instruments that have been proposed in the GB EMR, focusing on environmental quality, security of supply and economic sustainability. Using lessons learned from simulation, the paper concludes that effectively achieving the GB EMR objectives requires this comprehensive intervention or a similar one that includes the promotion of low carbon electricity generation through the simultaneous implementation of various direct and indirect incentives, such as a carbon price floor, a Feed in Tariff (FIT) and a capacity mechanism.

AB Blending biofuels into fossil fuels allows for emission reductions in the transportation sector. However, biofuels are not yet competitive due to high production costs and investments and thus, legal requirements like blending quotas or emission thresholds must be issued if biofuels are to contribute to European CO2-reduction goals. Thereby, the aim is to establish Pareto-efficient long-term legal requirements. Against this background, we develop an optimization model for simultaneously minimizing life cycle greenhouse gas emissions and maximizing discounted net present value in order to analyze the overall system of biomass cultivation, (bio)fuel production and blending. The applied epsilon-constraint approach allows to calculate Paretoefficient solutions. The model is applied to the German (bio)diesel market. We show that current and past European Union directives are not Pareto-efficient and cause unintended side effects. As results, information about trade-offs between the two objectives (minimizing life cycle greenhouse gas emissions and maximizing discounted net present value) as well as recommendations on the design of the regulation is derived.

ID PAIRWISE COMPARISON MATRICES; PRIORITIES; JUDGMENTS; AGGREGATION
AB The pairwise comparisons method is a convenient tool used when the relative order among different concepts (alternatives) needs to be determined. One popular implementation of the method is based on solving an eigenvalue problem for the pairwise comparisons matrix. In such cases the ranking result for the principal eigenvector of the pairwise comparisons matrix is adopted, while the eigenvalue is used to determine the index of inconsistency. A lot of research has been devoted to the critical analysis of the eigenvalue based approach. One of them is the work of Bana e Costa and Vansnick (2008). In their work, the authors define the conditions of order preservation (COP) and show that even for sufficiently consistent pairwise comparisons matrices, this condition cannot be met. The presented work defines more precise criteria for determining when the COP is met. To formulate the criteria, an error factor is used describing how far the input to the ranking procedure is from the ranking result. The relationship between the Saaty consistency index and COP is also discussed. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Since then, there was a strong increase of activity observed in this research field resulting in more than 120 new publications. In this paper, we classify this new literature according to the features of models considered for berth allocation, quay crane scheduling and integrated approaches by using the classification schemes proposed in the preceding survey. Moreover, we identify trends in the field, we take a look at the methods that have been developed for solving new models, we discuss ways for evaluating models and algorithms, and, finally, we light up potential directions for future research.

AB This paper resolves the complexity status of the well-known Traveling Repairman Problem on a line (Line-TRP) with general processing times at the request locations and deadline restrictions. It has long remained an open research question whether an exact solution procedure with pseudo-polynomial running time can be developed for this version of the Traveling Repairman Problem that was known to be at least binary NP-hard. The presented proof of strong NP-completeness of the problem is provided by a reduction from 3-PARTITION. Since recent literature provides significant new results for further variants of the Line-TRP and the Line-TSP, a brief updated overview of the complexity status of the different variants is given. Another major contribution is that a practically applicable exact best-first search Branch&Bound approach that optimally solves instances of real-world size in reasonable time is proposed. By applying sophisticated dominance rules as well as lower bounds, the number of enumerated partial solutions is kept limited. The efficiency of the new approach and the applied instruments is validated by a computational study. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem is a much-studied (and strongly NP-hard) combinatorial optimization problem, for which many integer programming formulations have been proposed. We present two new multi-commodity flow (MCF) formulations, and show that they dominate all of the existing ones, in the sense that their continuous relaxations yield stronger lower bounds. Moreover, we show that the relaxations can be strengthened, in pseudo-polynomial time, in such a way that all of the so-called knapsack large multistar (KLM) inequalities are satisfied. The only other relaxation known to satisfy the KLM inequalities, based on set partitioning, is strongly NP-hard to solve. Computational results demonstrate that the new MCF relaxations are significantly stronger than the previously known ones. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB We consider a continuous time-cost tradeoff problem with multiple milestones and completely ordered jobs. If a milestone is tardy, a penalty cost may be imposed. The processing times of jobs can be compressed by additional resources or activities that incur compression costs. The objective is to minimize the total penalty cost plus the total compression cost. We show that the problem is NP-hard, even if the compression cost is described as a concave function, and we present a pseudo-polynomial time algorithm for that case. Furthermore, we show that the problem is polynomially solvable if the compression cost function is convex. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB We consider an OEM who is responsible for the availability of her systems in the field through performance-based contracts. She detects that a critical reparable component in her systems has a poor reliability performance. She decides to improve its reliability by a redesign of that component and an upgrade of the systems by replacing the old components with the improved ones. We introduce a model for studying the following two upgrading policies that she may implement after the redesign: (1) Upgrade all systems preventively just after the redesign (at time 0), (2) Upgrade systems one-by-one correctively; i.e., only when an old component fails. Under Policy 2, the OEM decides on an initial supply quantity of the improved components. Once this initial supply is depleted, she can procure improved components in fixed-sized batches with a higher unit price. Per policy, we derive total cost functions, which include procurement/replenishment costs of the new components, upgrading costs, repair costs of the new components, inventory holding costs and downtime costs. We perform exact analysis and provide an efficient optimization algorithm for Policy 2. Through a numerical study, we derive insights on which of the two policies is the best one and we show how this depends on the lifetime of the systems, the reliability of the old components, the improvement level in the reliability, the increase in the unit price, downtime costs, the size of installed base, and the batch size.

AB Operations management aims to match the supply with demand of material flows, whereas corporate finance seeks to match the supply with demand of monetary flows. These two supply-demand matching processes are connected by real investment and revenue management in a "closed-loop" of resources. We propose a risk management framework for multidimensional integration of operations-finance interface models. Ten aspects are examined to specify conditions under which firms should integrate operations and finance. We present categorizations of operational hedging and financial flexibility. By linking relationship analysis (complements or substitutes) and approach choice (centralization or decentralization) of integrated risk management, we find that: (i) Zero interaction effects between operations and finance lead to decentralization. (ii) Operations and finance should be centralized even if they are partial substitutes. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

DE Bayesian analysis; Cricket; Imputation; Paired comparisons; WinBUGS
AB This paper investigates the powerplay in one-day cricket. The rules concerning the powerplay have been tinkered with over the years, and therefore the primary motivation of the paper is the assessment of the impact of the powerplay with respect to scoring. The form of the analysis takes a "what if" approach where powerplay outcomes are substituted with what might have happened had there been no powerplay. This leads to a paired comparisons setting consisting of actual matches and hypothetical parallel matches where outcomes are imputed during the powerplay period. Some of our findings include (a) the various forms of the powerplay which have been adopted over the years have different effects, (b) recent versions of the powerplay provide an advantage to the batting side, (c) more wickets also occur during the powerplay than had there been no powerplay and (d) there is some effect in run production due to the over where the powerplay is initiated. We also investigate individual batsmen and bowlers and their performances during the powerplay. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Strong uncertainties is a key challenge for the application of scheduling algorithms in real-world production environments, since the optimized schedule at a time often turns to be deteriorated or even infeasible during its execution due to a large majority of unexpected events. This paper studies the uncertain scheduling problem arising from the steelmaking-continuous casting (SCC) process and develops a soft-decision based two-layered approach (SDA) to cope with the challenge. In our approach, traditional scheduling decisions, i.e. the beginning time and assigned machine for each job at each stage, are replaced with soft scheduling decisions in order to provide more flexibility towards unexpected events. Furthermore, all unexpected events are classified into two categories in terms of the impact degree on scheduling: critical events and non-critical events. In the two-layered solution framework, the upper layer is the offline optimization layer for handling critical events, in which a particle swarm optimization algorithm is proposed for generating soft scheduling decisions; while the lower layer is the online dispatching layer for handling non-critical events, where a dispatching heuristic is designed to decide in real time which charge and when to process after a machine becomes available, with the guidance of the soft schedule given by the upper layer. Computational experiments on randomly generated SCC scheduling instances and practical production data demonstrate that the proposed soft-decision based approach can obtain significantly better solutions compared to other methods under strongly uncertain SCC production environments.

AB This paper investigates minimization of both the makespan and delivery costs in on-line supply chain scheduling for single-machine and parallel-machine configurations in a transportation system with a single customer. The jobs are released as they arrive, which implies that no information on upcoming jobs, such as the release time, processing time, and quantity, is known beforehand to the scheduler. The jobs are processed on one machine or parallel machines and delivered to the customer. The primary objective of the scheduling is time, which is makespan in this case. The delivery cost, which changes due to the varying number of batches (though the cost for each batch is assumed to be the same) in delivery, is also concerned. The goal of scheduling is thus to minimize both the makespan and the total delivery cost This scheduling involves deciding when to process jobs, which machine to process jobs, when to deliver jobs, and which batch to include jobs. We define 10 problems in terms of (1) the machine configuration, (2) preemption of job processing, (3) the number of vehicles, and (4) the capacity of vehicles. These problems (P1, P2,..., P10) have never been studied before in literature. The lower bound for each problem is first proved by constructing a series of intractable instances. Algorithms for these problems, denoted by H1, H2,..., H10, respectively, are then designed and a theoretical analysis is performed. The results show that H1, H2, H6, and H7 are optimal ones according to the competitive ratio criterion, while the other algorithms deviate slightly from the optimum. We also design the optimal algorithm for a special case of P5. A case study is provided to illustrate the performance of H5 and to demonstrate the practicality of the algorithms.

A vertex is recovered when it becomes connected to the depot by an already constructed path. Due dates for recovery times are associated with vertices. The problem is to obtain a construction schedule that minimizes the maximum lateness of vertices, or the number of tardy vertices.

AB Minmax regret optimization aims at finding robust solutions that perform best in the worst-case, compared to the respective optimum objective value in each scenario. Even for simple uncertainty sets like boxes, most polynomially solvable optimization problems have strongly NP-complete minmax regret counterparts. Thus, heuristics with performance guarantees can potentially be of great value, but only few such guarantees exist.
   A popular heuristic for combinatorial optimization problems is to compute the midpoint solution of the original problem. It is a well-known result that the regret of the midpoint solution is at most 2 times the optimal regret. Besides some academic instances showing that this bound is tight, most instances reveal a way better approximation ratio.
   We introduce a new lower bound for the optimal value of the minmax regret problem. Using this lower bound we state an algorithm that gives an instance-dependent performance guarantee for the midpoint solution that is at most 2. The computational complexity of the algorithm depends on the minmax regret problem under consideration; we show that our sharpened guarantee can be computed in strongly polynomial time for several classes of combinatorial optimization problems.
   To illustrate the quality of the proposed bound, we use it within a branch and bound framework for the robust shortest path problem. In an experimental study comparing this approach with a bound from the literature, we find a considerable improvement in computation times. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB We investigate the Minimum Evolution Problem (MEP), an NP-hard network design problem arising from computational biology. The MEP consists in finding a weighted unrooted binary tree having n leaves, minimal length, and such that the sum of the edge weights belonging to the unique path between each pair of leaves is greater than or equal to a prescribed value. We study the polyhedral combinatorics of the MEP and investigate its relationships with the Balanced Minimum Evolution Problem. We develop an exact solution approach for the MEP based on a nontrivial combination of a parallel branch-price-and-cut scheme and a non-isomorphic enumeration of all possible solutions to the problem. Computational experiments show that the new solution approach outperforms the best mixed integer linear programming formulation for the MEP currently described in the literature. Our results give a perspective on the combinatorics of the MEP and suggest new directions for the development of future exact solution approaches that may turn out useful in practical applications. We also show that the MEP is statistically consistent. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In this article we investigate the job Sequencing and tool Switching Problem (SSP), a NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem arising from computer and manufacturing systems. Starting from the results described in Tang and Denardo (1987), Crama et al. (1994) and Laporte et al. (2004), we develop new integer linear programming formulations for the problem that are provably better than the alternative ones currently described in the literature. Computational experiments show that the lower bounds obtained by the linear relaxation of the considered formulations improve, on average, upon those currently described in the literature and suggest, at the same time, new directions for the development of future exact solution approaches.

AB We consider a decentralized supply chain comprised of one manufacturer and one retailer where the manufacturer has random yield, and the retailer faces uncertain demand. To guarantee product availability, the retailer requires a service level of the product supply from the manufacturer. However, we determine that the high service level indeed benefits the retailer whereas causes the manufacturer's profit loss. Therefore, to promote the high-service-level cooperation, the retailer has to provide incentives for the manufacturer, such as bonuses. We consider two common bonus contracts: unit bonus and flat (or lump-sum) bonus. The primary question we address is whether the service-level based bonus contracts can achieve the two firms' Pareto-improving for both service level and profits, which is a prerequisite for the retailer to carry out them with the manufacturer. The results show that both bonus contracts can achieve Pareto-improving. While it is simpler for the retailer to carry out the unit bonus contract, the retailer can achieve a higher service level and higher profits under the flat bonus contract. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

ID OIL PRICE; SPEED; SHIPS
AB As bunker fuel cost constitutes a major portion of the shipping liners' operating cost, it is imperative for them to minimize the bunkering cost to remain competitive. Service contract with a fuel supplier is a strategy they venture on to reduce this cost. Typically, liner operators enter into a contract with fuel suppliers where the contract is specified by a fixed fuel price and amount, to mitigate the fluctuating spot prices and uncertain fuel consumption between the ports. In this paper, we study such bunkering service contracts with known parameters and determine the liner's optimal bunkering strategy. We propose to use bunker up to level policy for refueling, where the up to level is dynamic based on the observed spot price and determine the bunkering decisions (where to bunker and how much to bunker) at the ports. A dynamic programming model is formulated to minimize the total bunkering cost Due to the inherent complexity in determining the gradient of the cost-to-go function, we estimate it by Monte Carlo simulation. Numerical experiments suggest that all the contract parameters must be considered together in determination of the optimal bunkering strategy. Contracting an amount lesser than the average consumption for the entire voyage, at a contract price lesser than the average spot price is found to be beneficial. The insights derived from this study can be helpful in designing these types of service contracts. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Our model captures the phenomenon of an anticipated future event that may or may not lead to a discounted offer. We analyze the model and show that the optimal solution results from a tradeoff between preparing for the special offer and staying with the regular ordering policy. We quantify the tradeoff and find that the optimal solution is one of four intuitive policies. We present numerical illustrations that provide additional insights on the relationship between the different ordering policies. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This paper investigates the modal split and trip scheduling decisions with consideration of the commuters' uncertainty expectation in the morning commute problem. Two physically separated modes for transportation, the auto mode on highway and the transit mode on subway, are available for commuters to choose for traveling from home to workplace. The travel time uncertainty is assumed to only occur on highway. Every commuter is faced with the joint choice of transport mode and trip scheduling for minimizing her/his generalized travel cost. The study reveals that uncertainty expectation can significantly influence the travel decisions and lead to a distinctive flow pattern. We also examine the effects of transit headway and fare on modal split and equilibrium cost by numerical examples. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In selecting the preferred course of action, decision makers are often uncertain about one or more probabilities of interest. The experimental literature has ascertained that this uncertainty (ambiguity) might affect decision makers' preferences. Then, the decision maker might wish to incorporate ambiguity aversion in the analysis. We investigate the modeling ambiguity attitudes in the solution of decision analysis problems through functionals well-established in the decision theory literature. We obtain the multiple-event problems for subjective expected utility, smooth ambiguity and maximin decision makers. This allows us to establish the conditions under which these alternative decision makers face equivalent problems. Results for certainty equivalents and risk premia in the presence of both risk and ambiguity aversion are obtained. A recent generalization of the classical Arrow-Pratt quadratic approximation allows us to quantify the portions of a premium due to risk- and to ambiguity-aversion. The numerical implementation of the objective functions is addressed, showing that all functionals can be estimated at no additional burden through Monte Carlo simulation. The well known Carter Racing case study is addressed quantitatively to demonstrate the findings. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

LA English
DT Article
DE DEA; Partial impacts; DMU specific impacts
ID DATA ENVELOPMENT ANALYSIS; EFFICIENCY
AB Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) is a methodology for evaluating the relative efficiencies of a set of decisionmaking units (DMUs). The original model is based on the assumption that in a multiple input, multiple output setting, all inputs impact all outputs. In many situations, however, this assumption may not apply, such as would be the case in manufacturing environments where some products may require painting while others would not. In earlier work by the authors, the conventional DEA methodology was extended to allow for efficiency measurement in such situations where partial input-to-output interactions exist In that methodology all DMUs have identical input/output profiles. It is often the case, however, that these profiles can be different for some DMUs than is true of others. This phenomenon can be prevalent, for example, in manufacturing settings where some plants may use robots for spot welding while other plants may use human resources for that task. Consider a highway maintenance application where consulting services for safety corrections may not be employed on low traffic roadways, but are commonly used on high traffic, multilane highways. Thus, input to output links in the case of some DMUs are missing in the case of others. To address this, the current paper extends the methodology presented earlier by the authors to allow for efficiency measurement in situations where some DMUs have different input/output profiles than is true of others. The new methodology is then applied to the problem of evaluating the efficiencies of a set of road maintenance patrols. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In this paper, we take a novel approach to address the dilemma of innovation sharing versus protection among supply chain partners. The paper conducts an exploratory study that introduces factors affecting a firm's optimum supply chain innovation strategy. We go beyond the conventional Prisoners' Dilemma, with its limiting assumptions of players' preferences and symmetry, to explore a larger pool of 2 x 2 games that may effectively model the problem. After classifying firm types according to collaboration motive and relative power, we use simulation to explore the effects of firm type, opponent type, and payoff structure on repeated innovation interactions (or, equivalently, long-term relations) and optimality of 'niceness'. Surprisingly, we find that opponent type is essentially irrelevant in long-term innovation interactions, and focal firm type is only conditionally relevant The paper contributes further by introducing reciprocation of strategy type (nice versus mean), showing that reciprocation is recommended, while identifying and explaining the exceptions to this conclusion.

ID PROJECT EVALUATION; INTERNAL RATE; RETURN; DECISIONS; CERTAINTY
AB Evaluating an industrial opportunity often means to engage in financial modeling which results in estimation of a large amount of economic and accounting data, which are then gathered in an economically rational framework; the pro forma financial statements. While the standard net present value (NPV) condenses all the available pieces of information into a single metric, we make full use of the crucial information supplied in the pro forma financial statements and give a more detailed account of how economic value is created. In particular, we construct a general model, allowing for varying interest rates, which decomposes the project into investment side and financing side and quantifies the value created by either side; an equity/debt decomposition is also accomplished, which enables to appreciate the role of debt in adding or subtracting value to equityholders. Further, the major role of accounting rates of return as value drivers is highlighted, and new relative measures of worth are introduced: the project ROA and the project WACC, which aggregate information deriving from the period rates of return. To achieve these results, we make use of the Average-Internal-Rate-of-Return (AIRR) approach, recently introduced, which rests on capital-weighted arithmetic means and sets a direct relation between holding period rates and NPV.

AB We consider the economic lot-sizing problem with perishable items (ELS-PI), where each item has a deterministic expiration date. Although all items in stock are equivalent regardless of procurement or expiration date, we allow for an allocation mechanism that defines an order in which the items are allocated to the consumers. In particular, we consider the following allocation mechanisms: First Expiration, First Out (FEFO), Last Expiration, First Out (LEFO), First In, First Out (FIFO) and Last In, First Out (LIFO). We show that the ELS-PI can be solved in polynomial time under all four allocation mechanisms in case of no procurement capacities. This result still holds in case of time-invariant procurement capacities under the FIFO and LEFO allocation mechanisms, but the problem becomes NP-hard under the FEFO and LIFO allocation mechanisms.

AB Managerial flexibility can have a significant impact on the value of new product development projects. We investigate how the market environment in which a firm operates influences the value and use of development flexibility. We characterize the market environment according to two dimensions, namely (i) its intensity, and (ii) its degree of innovation. We show that these two market characteristics can have a different effect on the value of flexibility. In particular, we show that more intense or innovative environments may increase or decrease the value of flexibility. For instance, we demonstrate that the option to defer a product launch is typically most valuable when there is little competition. We find, however, that under certain conditions defer options may be highly valuable in more competitive environments. We also consider the value associated with the flexibility to switch development strategies, from a focus on incremental innovations to more risky ground-breaking products. We find that such a switching option is most valuable when the market is characterized by incremental innovations and by relatively intense competition. Our insights can help firms understand how managerial flexibility should be explored, and how it might depend on the nature of the environment in which they operate. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB University rankings are the subject of a paradox: the more they are criticized by social scientists and experts on methodological grounds, the more they receive attention in policy making and the media. In this paper we attempt to give a contribution to the birth of a new generation of rankings, one that might improve on the current state of the art, by integrating new kind of information and using new ranking techniques. Our approach tries to overcome four main criticisms of university rankings, namely: monodimensionality; statistical robustness; dependence on university size and subject mix; lack of consideration of the input-output structure. We provide an illustration on European universities and conclude by pointing on the importance of investing in data integration and open data at European level both for research and for policy making.

AB A decision support tool is proposed for optimising the expansion planning of a semi-liberalised electricity market, whilst the underlying interaction of the generating mix with electricity prices is researched, in the long-run. A nonlinear stochastic programming algorithm is used for handling multiple uncertainties, optimising the power sector characteristics, both in terms of financial and environmental performance. Two endogenous models and an exogenous one are analysed and compared. The endogenous model results indicate that consumers might benefit by the moderate electricity prices in case the optimal loads and capacity orders are rendered. The exogenous model is insensitive to generating mix variations. The long-term actions suggested for system operators are comprised of the permits issued for new entries. They are affected by the evolution of electricity prices, since the permits granted for conventional technologies are maintained when their profits are rising. The permits granted for renewable technologies are also maintained, thus allowing cleaner electricity production to be induced to the grid. The optimal bid strategies of generators interact with their dispatching schedule and the diversification of their load curves. The relevant bids are primarily driven by the merit order, the plants are dispatched in. The assigned load levels may be raised in profitable producers so that their profit is maximised. They might be restrained instead, in case there are no significant prospects for individual profits. The lognormal distribution of electricity price results is characterised by increasing variance over time, indicating that the model is more robust in the most imminent solutions.

Because of pickup and delivery operations that occur at intermediate airports, this problem is simultaneously a Weight & Balance Problem and a Sequencing Problem. Our objective is to minimize fuel and handling operation costs. This problem is shown to be NP-hard. We resort to a mixed integer linear program. Based on real-world data from a professional partner (TNT Airways), we perform numerical experiments using a standard B&C library. This approach yields better solutions than traditional manual planning, which results in substantial cost savings. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Day ahead electricity prices in European markets are determined by double-blind auctions. That is, both buyers and sellers may place anonymous orders with different prices and quantities. The market operator has to solve an optimization problem within an hour to clear the auction and determine the prices for the Day Ahead Market (DAM) which are used as a reference point for the other electricity contracts. All electricity traded at the same time period is traded at the same price, called market clearing price. The market operator has to end the algorithm with a feasible solution if the algorithm could not find the optimal solution within the time limit In this paper, we develop an optimization model to solve the problem with day ahead electricity prices including all the practical considerations in the Turkish DAM. We present a mixed integer formulation and provide methods based on aggregation techniques and variable elimination to solve the problem within the limits of the practical requirements. Using real market data, we show that, aggregation reduces the problem size approximately 60 percent whereas variable elimination provides another 30 percent reduction. We also propose an IP-based large neighborhood search to obtain an initial solution. Empirical evidences coming from the Turkish DAM data indicate the heuristic has a substantial solution quality and the overall suggestions deliver remarkable solution time improvements. This is the first paper in terms of formulating DAM problem in Turkey, developing new approaches to solve it within the time limits of the market, and using real data. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

ID LINEAR-PROGRAMMING APPROACH; GATE ASSIGNMENTS; TIME
AB The time required to board an airplane directly influences an airplane's turn-around time, i.e., the time that the airplane requires at the gate between two flights. Thus, the turn-around time can be reduced by using efficient boarding methods and such actions may also result in cost savings. The main contribution of this paper is fourfold. First, we provide a general problem description including partly established and partly new definitions of relevant terms. Next, we survey boarding methods known from theory and practice and provide an according classification scheme. Third, we present a broad overview on the current literature in this field and we describe 12 most relevant papers in detail and juxtapose their results. Fourth, we summarize the state-of-the-art of research in this field showing e.g., that the commonly used strategy back-to-front generally requires more time than other easy to implement strategies such as random boarding. Further concepts and approaches that can help speed up the boarding process are also presented and these can be studied in future research. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB We present a column generation algorithm for solving the bi-objective multi-commodity minimum cost flow problem. This method is based on the hi-objective simplex method and Dantzig-Wolfe decomposition. The method is initialised by optimising the problem with respect to the first objective, a single objective multi-commodity flow problem, which is solved using Dantzig-Wolfe decomposition. Then, similar to the bi-objective simplex method, our algorithm iteratively moves from one non-dominated extreme point to the next one by finding entering variables with the maximum ratio of improvement of the second objective over deterioration of the first objective. Our method reformulates the problem into a bi-objective master problem over a set of capacity constraints and several single objective linear fractional sub-problems each over a set of network flow conservation constraints. The master problem iteratively updates cost coefficients for the fractional sub-problems. Based on these cost coefficients an optimal solution of each sub-problem is obtained. The solution with the best ratio objective value out of all sub-problems represents the entering variable for the master basis. The algorithm terminates when there is no entering variable which can improve the second objective by deteriorating the first objective. This implies that all non-dominated extreme points of the original problem are obtained. We report on the performance of the algorithm on several directed bi-objective network instances with different characteristics and different numbers of commodities. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB This paper proposes a variant of the well-known capacitated vehicle routing problem that models the routing of vehicles in the cash-in-transit industry by introducing a risk constraint. In the Risk-constrained Cash-in-Transit Vehicle Routing Problem (RCTVRP), the risk of being robbed, which is assumed to be proportional both to the amount of cash being carried and the time or the distance covered by the vehicle carrying the cash, is limited by a risk threshold.
   A library containing two sets of instances for the RCTVRP, some with known optimal solution, is generated. A mathematical formulation is developed and small instances of the problem are solved by using IBM CPLEX.
   Four constructive heuristics as well as a local search block composed of six local search operators are developed and combined using two different metaheuristic structures: a multistart heuristic and a pertur-band-improve structure. In a statistical experiment, the best parameter settings for each component are determined, and the resulting heuristic configurations are compared in their best possible setting. The resulting metaheuristics are able to obtain solutions of excellent quality in very limited computing times. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Endogeneity, and the distortions on the estimation of economic models that it causes, is a usual problem in the econometrics literature. Although non-parametric methods like Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) are among the most used techniques for measuring technical efficiency, the effects of such problem on efficiency estimates have received little attention. The aim of this paper is to alert DEA practitioners about the accuracy of their estimates under the presence of endogeneity. For this, first we illustrate the endogeneity problem and its causes in production processes and its implications for the efficiency measurement from a conceptual perspective. Second, using synthetic data generated in a Monte Carlo experiment we evaluate how different levels of positive and negative endogeneity can impair DEA estimations. We conclude that, although DEA is robust to negative endogeneity, a high positive endogeneity level, i.e., the existence of a high positive correlation between one input and the true efficiency level, might bias severely DEA estimates.

AB Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs) face many obstacles when they try to access the credit market. These obstacles increase if the SMEs are innovative. In this case, financial data are insufficient or even unreliable. Thus, building a judgmental rating model, mainly based on qualitative criteria (soft information), is very important to finance SMEs' activities. Till now, there has not been a multicriteria credit risk model based on soft information for innovative SMEs. In this paper, we try to fill this gap by presenting a multicriteria credit risk model named ELECTRE-TRI. A SMAA-TRI analysis is also implemented to obtain robust SMEs' assignments to the risk classes. SMAA-TRI incorporates ELECTRE-TRI by considering different sets of preference parameters and uncertainty in the data via Monte Carlo simulations. Finally, we carry out a real case study with the aim of illustrating the multicriteria credit risk model. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In this paper, a continuous multi-product model is developed to represent the shop floor dynamics of a job shop, based on dynamic modeling and on analogies to electrical components. This approach allows the mathematical formulation of the model (state representation) and the analysis of its dynamic response via simulation. A real case application in the textile industry is presented. Thus, this research contributes in the following ways: first, proposing a model that is suitable for multi-product systems with intricate job shop configuration and that is generalizable to various manufacturing systems; second, presenting a real case application of the proposed model. As practical implications, it provides production managers and practitioners with a prescriptive decision model that considers the dynamics of the production systems and the interdependencies of the decisions made in the shop floor. From the academic perspective, it contributes to the existing literature by presenting the application of an alternative modeling methodology, and by extending this methodology to manufacturing systems with multiple products, instead of single-product systems. Continuous models such as the one proposed can benefit from a wide range of tools for system analysis and control design, come from control theory. Although these tools have been extensively applied to model the supply chain, applications devoted to the plant level seem to be neglected over the past years. This model also aims to contribute in this direction. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In this paper we address the Preemptive Resource Constrained Project Scheduling Problem (PRCPSP). PRCPSP requires a partially ordered set of activities to be scheduled using limited renewable resources such that any activity can be interrupted and later resumed without penalty. The objective is to minimize the project duration. This paper proposes an effective branch-and-price algorithm for solving PRCPSP based upon minimal Interval Order Enumeration involving column generation as well as constraint propagation. Experiments conducted on various types of instances have given very satisfactory results. Our algorithm is able to solve to optimality the entire set of J30, BL and Pack instances while satisfying the preemptive requirement. Furthermore, this algorithm provides improved best-known lower bounds for some of the J60, J90 and J120 instances in the non-preemptive case (RCPSP). (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In this paper we introduce the discrete time window assignment vehicle routing problem (DTWAVRP) that can be viewed as a two-stage stochastic optimization problem. Given a set of customers that must be visited on the same day regularly within some period of time, the first-stage decisions are to assign to each customer a time window from a set of candidate time windows before demand is known. In the second stage, when demand is revealed for each day of the time period, vehicle routes satisfying vehicle capacity and the assigned time windows are constructed. The objective of the DTWAVRP is to minimize the expected total transportation cost. To solve this problem, we develop an exact branch-price-and-cut algorithm and derive from it five column generation heuristics that allow to solve larger instances than those solved by the exact algorithm. We illustrate the performance of these algorithms by means of computational experiments performed on randomly generated instances. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF OPERATIONAL RESEARCH

DT Article
DE Combinatorial optimization; Data transfer; Scheduling; Routing
AB Systems of systems are collections of independent systems which interact and share information to provide services. To communicate, systems can opportunistically make use of contacts that occur when two entities are close enough to each other. In this paper, it is assumed that reliable predictions can be made about the sequence of such contacts for each system. An information item (a datum) is split into several datum units which are to be delivered to recipient systems. During a contact between two systems, a sending system can transfer one stored datum unit to a receiving system. Source systems initially store some of the datum units. The data transfer problem consists in searching for a valid transfer plan, i.e. a transfer plan allowing the datum units to be transmitted from their source systems to the recipient systems. The dissemination problem consists in searching a valid transfer plan which minimizes the dissemination length, i.e. the number of contacts which are necessary to deliver all the datum units to the recipient nodes. To our knowledge, there is no previous work attempting to determine the theoretical complexity of these problems. The aim of this paper is to determine the frontier between easy and hard problems. We show that the problems are strongly NP-Hard when the number of recipients is equal to 2 or more (while the number of datum units is unbounded) or the number of datum units is equal to 2 or more (while the number of recipients is unbounded). We also show that these problems are polynomially solvable when the number of datum units or the number of recipient nodes is equal to 1, or when these parameters are all upper bounded by given positive numbers. The complexity of two related problems is also studied. It is shown that knowing whether there exist k mutually arc-disjoint branchings in an evolving graph and k arc-disjoint Steiner trees in a directed graph without circuit are strongly NP-Complete.

AB Resource loading appears in many variants in tactical (mid-term) capacity planning in multi-project environments. It develops a rough sketch of the resource usage and timing of the work packages of a portfolio of orders. The orders need to be executed within a time horizon organized into periods, each of which has a known number of workers available. Each order has a time window during which it must be executed, as well as an upper and lower bound on the number of workers that can work on this order in a period. The duration of the order is not fixed beforehand, but depends on the number of workers (intensity) with which it is executed.
   In this article we define three fundamental variants of resource loading and study six special cases that are common to the three variants. We present algorithms for those cases that can be solved either in polynomial time or in pseudo-polynomial time. The remaining cases are proven to be NP-complete in the strong sense, and we discuss the existence of approximation algorithms for some of these cases. Finally, we comment on the validity of our results when orders must be executed without preemption. Although inspired by a number of practical applications, this work focuses on the properties of the underlying generic combinatorial problems. Our findings contribute to a better understanding of these problems and may also serve as a reference work for authors looking to design efficient algorithms for similar problems.

AB The paper deals with the definition and the computation of surrogate upper bound sets for the bi-objective bi-dimensional binary knapsack problem. It introduces the Optimal Convex Surrogate Upper Bound set, which is the tightest possible definition based on the convex relaxation of the surrogate relaxation. Two exact algorithms are proposed: an enumerative algorithm and its improved version. This second algorithm results from an accurate analysis of the surrogate multipliers and the dominance relations between bound sets. Based on the improved exact algorithm, an approximated version is derived. The proposed algorithms are benchmarked using a dataset composed of three groups of numerical instances. The performances are assessed thanks to a comparative analysis where exact algorithms are compared between them, the approximated algorithm is confronted to an algorithm introduced in a recent research work.

ID LOCAL SEARCH; OPTIMIZATION; SYSTEM
AB Process planning and jobshop scheduling problems are both crucial functions in manufacturing. In reality, dynamic disruptions such as machine breakdown or rush order will affect the feasibility and optimality of the sequentially-generated process plans and machining schedules. With the approach of integrated process planning and scheduling (IPPS), the actual process plan and the schedule are determined dynamically in accordance with the order details and the status of the manufacturing system. In this paper, an object-coding genetic algorithm (OCGA) is proposed to resolve the IPPS problems in a jobshop type of flexible manufacturing systems. An effective object-coding representation and its corresponding genetic operations are suggested, where real objects like machining operations are directly used to represent genes. Based on the object-coding representation, customized methods are proposed to fulfill the genetic operations. An unusual selection and a replacement strategy are integrated systematically for the population evolution, aiming to achieve near-optimal solutions through gradually improving the overall quality of the population, instead of exploring neighborhoods of good individuals. Experiments show that the proposed genetic algorithm can generate outstanding outcomes for complex IPPS instances. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

DE Routing; Integer linear programming; Heuristics; District design;
   Capacitated arc routing
ID DESIGN; PICKUP; SHAPE
AB Real world applications for vehicle collection or delivery along streets usually lead to arc routing problems, with additional and complicating constraints. In this paper we focus on arc routing with an additional constraint to identify vehicle service routes with a limited number of shared nodes, i.e. vehicle service routes with a limited number of intersections. This constraint leads to solutions that are better shaped for real application purposes. We propose a new problem, the bounded overlapping MCARP (BCARP), which is defined as the mixed capacitated arc routing problem (MCARP) with an additional constraint imposing an upper bound on the number of nodes that are common to different routes. The best feasible upper bound is obtained from a modified MCARP in which the minimization criteria is given by the overlapping of the routes. We show how to compute this bound by solving a simpler problem. To obtain feasible solutions for the bigger instances of the KARP heuristics are also proposed. Computational results taken from two well known instance sets show that, with only a small increase in total time traveled, the model BCARP produces solutions that are more attractive to implement in practice than those produced by the MCARP model.

AB Many service providers, such as restaurants, are selling their gift cards through independent retailers. We analyze a supply chain of a service provider who sells products and gift cards at face value at its locations. The service provider also sells its gift cards through a retailer. Consumers may buy gift cards from the service provider or the retailer for their own use and/or to use as gifts. Consumers may be customers of both the service provider and retailer (Dual), only the service provide (SP-only), or only the retailer (retailer-only). We find that under a large enough gift cards' redemption rate and no gift-givers, it is sub-optimal for a service provider to sell gift cards through a retailer. When there are some Retailer-only gift-givers, it is optimal for the service provider to sell gift cards through a retailer. We identify threshold redemption rates at which it is optimal for a service provider to sell gift cards through an independent retailer to different consumer segments. We also find that the SP may not always prefer a low redemption rate and for some service providers with large additional spending rates above redeemed gift cards' value, profit may increase with the redemption rate. Also, centralization in the SP-retailer supply chain in this paper may lead to only a small increase in profits. Numerical analysis indicate that the redemption rate needed to make it optimal for the service provider to sell gift cards to all consumers through a retailer is unlikely to occur in practice.

AB This paper studies the inventory system of a retailer who orders his products from two supply sources, a local one that is responsive and reliable, but expensive, and a global one that is low-cost but less reliable. The deliveries from the global source only partially satisfy the quality requirements. We model this situation with a dual-sourcing inventory model with positive lead times and random yield. We propose a dual-index order-up-to policy (DOP) based on approximating the inventory model with an unreliable supplier by a sequence of dual-sourcing models with reliable suppliers and suitably modified demand distributions. Numerical results show that the performance of this heuristic is close to that of the optimal DOP. Moreover, we extend the heuristic to models with advance yield information and study its impact on the total inventory costs. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEM's) of advanced capital goods often offer service contracts for system support to their customers, for which spare parts are needed. Due to technological changes, suppliers of spare parts may stop production at some point in time. As a reaction to that decision, an OEM may place a so-called Last Time Buy (LTB) order to cover demand for spare parts during the remaining service period, which may last for many years. The fact that there might be other alternative sources of supply in the next periods complicates the decision on the LTB. In this paper, we develop a heuristic method to find the near-optimal LTB quantity in presence of an imperfect repair option of the failed parts that can be returned from the field. Comparison of our method to simulation shows high approximation accuracy. Numerical experiments reveal that repair is an excellent option as alternative sourcing, even if it is more expensive than buying a new part, because of the option to postpone the repair until the parts are needed. In addition, we show the impact of other key parameters on costs and LTB quantity. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Utility functions have been used widely to support multi-objective decision-making. Expansion of a general additive utility function around the ideal results in a composite linear-quadratic metric of a compromise programming problem. Determining the unknown parameters of the composite linear-quadratic metric requires substantial interaction with the decision maker who might not always be available or capable to participate in such a process. We propose a non-interactive method that uses information on observed attribute levels to obtain the unknown parameters of the composite linear-quadratic metric and enables forecasting and scenario analysis. The method is illustrated with a small scale numerical example. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Portfolio optimization context has shed only a little light on the dependence structure among the financial returns along with the fat-tailed distribution associated with them. This study tries to find a remedy for this shortcoming by exploiting stable distributions as the marginal distributions together with the dependence structure based on copula function. We formulate the portfolio optimization problem as a multi-objective mixed integer programming. Value-at-Risk (VaR) is specified as the risk measure due to its intuitive appeal and importance in financial regulations. In order to enhance the model's applicability, we take into account cardinality and quantity constraints in the model. Imposing such practical constraints has resulted in a non-continuous feasible region. Hence, we propose two variants of multi-objective particle swarm optimization (MOPSO) algorithms to tackle this issue. Finally, a comparative study among the proposed MOPSOs, NSGAII and SPEA2 algorithms is made to demonstrate which algorithm is outperformed. The empirical results reveal that one of the proposed MOPSOs is superior over the other salient algorithms in terms of performance metrics. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Discrete event simulation (DES) studies in healthcare are thought to benefit from stakeholder participation during the study lifecycle. This paper reports on a multi-methodology framework, called PartiSim that is intended to support participative simulation studies. PartiSim combines DES, a traditionally hard OR approach, with soft systems methodology (SSM) in order to incorporate stakeholder involvement in the study lifecycle. The framework consists of a number of prescribed activities and outputs as part of the stages involved in the simulation lifecycle, which include study initiation, finding out about the problem, defining a conceptual model, model coding, experimentation and implementation. In PartiSim four of these stages involve facilitated workshops with a group of stakeholders. We explain the organisation of workshops, the key roles assigned to analysts and stakeholders, and how facilitation is embedded in the framework. We discuss our experience of using the framework, provide guidance on when to use it and conclude with future research directions. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Combinatorial auctions allow allocation of bundles of items to the bidders who value them the most. The NP-hardness of the winner determination problem (WDP) has imposed serious computational challenges when designing efficient solution algorithms. This paper analytically studies the Lagrangian relaxation of WDP and expounds a novel technique for efficiently solving the relaxation problem. Moreover, we introduce a heuristic algorithm that adjusts any infeasibilities from the Lagrangian optimal solution to reach an optimal or a near optimal solution. Extensive numerical experiments illustrate the class of problems on which application of this technique provides near optimal solutions in much less time, as little as a fraction of a thousand, as compared to the CPLEX solver.

AB This paper investigates the constraints handling technique (CHT) in algorithms of the constrained multi-criteria optimization problem (CMOP). The CHT is an important research topic in constrained multi-criteria optimization (MO). In this paper, two simple and practicable CHTs are proposed, where one is a nonequivalent relaxation approach which is much suitable for the constrained multi-criteria discrete optimization problem (MDOP), and the other is an equivalent relaxation approach for the general CMOP. By using these CHTs, a CMOP (i.e., the primal problem) can be transformed into an unconstrained multi-criteria optimization problem (MOP) (i.e., the relaxation problem). Based on the first CHT, it is theoretically proven that the efficient set of the primal CMOP is a subset of the strictly efficient set of the relaxation problem and can be extracted from (E) over bar by simply checking the dominance relation between the solutions in E. Follows from these theoretical results, a three-phase based idea is given to effectively utilize the existing algorithms for the unconstrained MDOP to solve the constrained MDOP. In the second CHT, the primal CMOP is equivalently transformed into an unconstrained MOP by a special relaxation approach. Based on such a CHT, it is proven that the primal problem and its relaxation problem have the same efficient set and, therefore, general CMOPs can be solved by utilizing any of the existing algorithms for the unconstrained MOPs. The implementing idea, say two-phase based idea, of the second CHT is illustrated by implanting a known MOEA. Finally, the two-phase based idea is applied to some of the early MOEAs and the application performances are comprehensively tested with some benchmarks of the CMOP. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB The problem of sharing a cost M among n individuals, identified by some characteristic c(i) is an element of R+, appears in many real situations. Two important proposals on how to share the cost are the egalitarian and the proportional solutions. In different situations a combination of both distributions provides an interesting approach to the cost sharing problem. In this paper we obtain a family of (compromise) solutions associated to the Perron's eigenvectors of Levinger's transformations of a characteristics matrix A. This family includes both the egalitarian and proportional solutions, as well as a set of suitable intermediate proposals, which we analyze in some specific contexts, as claims problems and inventory cost games.

This problem being modeled as a multi-objective mixed integer linear program, we provide an interactive system based on an adaptive reference point approach. This system adapts, in real-time, priorities given to the different criteria according to the traffic situation. Formal guarantees are provided on the behavior of our system.

AB Cloud computing promises the flexible delivery of computing services in a pay-as-you-go manner. It allows customers to easily scale their infrastructure and save on the overall cost of operation. However Cloud service offerings can only thrive if customers are satisfied with service performance. Allowing instantaneous access and flexible scaling while maintaining the service levels and offering competitive prices poses a significant challenge to Cloud computing providers. Furthermore services will remain available in the long run only if this business generates a stable revenue stream. To address these challenges we introduce novel policy-based service admission control models that aim at maximizing the revenue of Cloud providers while taking informational uncertainty regarding resource requirements into account. Our evaluation shows that policy-based approaches statistically significantly outperform first come first serve approaches, which are still state of the art. Furthermore the results give insights in how and to what extent uncertainty has a negative impact on revenue. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Population growth creates a challenge to food availability and access. To balance supply with growing demand, more food has to move from production to consumption sites. Moreover, demand for locally-grown food is increasing and the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) seeks to develop and strengthen regional and local food systems. This article examines wholesale facility (hub) locations in food supply chain systems on a national scale to facilitate the efficient transfer of food from production regions to consumption locations. It designs an optimal national wholesale or hub location network to serve food consumption markets through efficient connections with production sites. The mathematical formulation is a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) problem that minimizes total network costs which include costs of transporting goods and locating facilities. A scenario study is used to examine the model's sensitivity to parameter changes, including travel distance, hub capacity, transportation cost, etc. An application is made to the U.S. fruit and vegetable industry. We demonstrate how parameter changes affect the optimal locations and number of wholesale facilities. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Drastic changes in consumer markets over the last decades have increased the pressure and challenges for the trade exhibition industry. Exhibiting organizations demand higher levels of justification for involvement and expect returns on trade show investments. This study proposes an RFID-enabled track and traceability framework to improve information visibility at the trade site. The identification information can potentially create detailed, accurate, and complete visibility of attendees' movements and purchasing behaviors and consequently lead to considerable analytical benefits. Leveraging the wealth of information made available by RFID is challenging; thus, the objective of this study is to outline how to incorporate RFID data into existing enterprise data to deliver analytical solutions to the trade show and exhibition industry. The results show that the exhibitor can use RFID to gather visitor intelligence and the key findings of this study provide valuable feedback to business analysts to promote follow-up marketing strategies.

AB This paper presents a novel approach for solving an integrated production planning and scheduling problem. In theory as well as in practice, because of their complexity, these two decision levels are most of the time treated sequentially. Scheduling largely depends on the production quantities (lot sizes) computed at the production planning level and ignoring scheduling constraints in planning leads to inconsistent decisions. Integrating production planning and scheduling is therefore important for efficiently managing operations. An integrated model and an iterative solution procedure were proposed in earlier research papers: The approach has limitations, in particular when solving the planning problem. In this paper, a new formulation is proposed to determine a feasible optimal production plan, i.e. lot sizes, for a fixed sequence of operations on the machines when setup costs and times are taken into account. Capacity constraints correspond to paths of the conjunctive graph associated to the sequence. An original Lagrangian relaxation approach is proposed to solve this NP-hard problem. A lower bound is derived and an upper bound is calculated using a novel constructive heuristic. The quality of the approach is tested on numerous problem instances.

AB Difficult combinatorial optimization problems coming from practice are nowadays often approached by hybrid metaheuristics that combine principles of classical metaheuristic techniques with advanced methods from fields like mathematical programming, dynamic programming, and constraint programming. If designed appropriately, such hybrids frequently outperform simpler "pure" approaches as they are able to exploit the underlying methods' individual advantages and benefit from synergy. This article starts with a general review of design patterns for hybrid approaches that have been successful on many occasions. More complex practical problems frequently have some special structure that might be exploited. In the field of mixed integer linear programming, three decomposition techniques are particularly well known for taking advantage of special structures: Lagrangian decomposition, Dantzig-Wolfe decomposition (column generation), and Benders' decomposition. It has been recognized that these concepts may also provide a very fruitful basis for effective hybrid metaheuristics. We review the basic principles of these decomposition techniques and discuss for each promising possibilities for combinations with metaheuristics. The approaches are illustrated with successful examples from literature. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Branch and Fix Coordination is an algorithm intended to solve large scale multi-stage stochastic mixed integer problems, based on the particular structure of such problems, so that they can be broken down into smaller subproblems. With this in mind, it is possible to use distributed computation techniques to solve the several subproblems in a parallel way, almost independently. To guarantee non-anticipativity in the global solution, the values of the integer variables in the subproblems are coordinated by a master thread. Scenario 'clusters' lend themselves particularly well to parallelisation, allowing us to solve some problems noticeably faster. Thanks to the decomposition into smaller subproblems, we can also attempt to solve otherwise intractable instances. In this work, we present details on the computational implementation of the Branch and Fix Coordination algorithm. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB The redundancy allocation problem is the problem of finding an optimal allocation of redundant components subject to a set of resource constraints. The problem studied in this paper refers to a series-parallel system configuration and allows for component mixing. We propose a new modeling/solution approach, in which the problem is transformed into a multiple choice knapsack problem and solved to optimality via a branch and cut algorithm. The algorithm is tested on well-known sets of benchmark instances. All instances have been solved to optimality in milliseconds or very few seconds on a normal workstation. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB In this paper we define a new problem, the aim of which is to find a set of k dissimilar solutions for a vehicle routing problem (VRP) on a single instance. This problem has several practical applications in the cash-in-transit sector and in the transportation of hazardous materials. A min-max mathematical formulation is proposed which requires a maximum similarity threshold between VRP solutions, and the number k of dissimilar VRP solutions that need to be generated. An index to measure similarities between VRP solutions is defined based on the edges shared between pairs of alternative solutions. An iterative metaheuristic to generate k dissimilar alternative solutions is also presented. The solution approach is tested using large and medium size benchmark instances for the capacitated vehicle routing problem. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Recent regulations on agri-food traceability prescribe traceability throughout the entire supply chain, in order to ensure consumers' safety and product quality. This has led producers and retailers to consider the opportunity to improve the firm's reputation and consumer confidence through the implementation of traceability systems designed not only to satisfy the legal requirements, but also to track the quality of the products through the supply chain for optimization purposes. However the actual implementation of such systems depends on the possibility of gathering specific information related to the product quality. Nowadays, innovative and non invasive technologies such as the Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) allow the automatic real time collection of data, thus enabling the development of effective traceability systems. In such context the expected value of traceability is a fundamental issue concerning the economic analysis of costs involved in such an investment and the optimal granularity level of implementation. This paper aims at evaluating the expected value of the implementation of traceability systems for perishable products like fruits and vegetables, and its profit. The study presents a mathematical stochastic approach for optimizing the supply chain profit and establishing the optimal granularity level (namely the Economic Traceability Lot) when a RFID solution is adopted. In particular, the supply chain profit in the presence of RFID traceability system has been calculated and compared with the expected profit in absence of such a system, and the results confirm the importance of the specific characteristics of the supply chain in determining the optimal configuration of the traceability system.

AB The purpose of this study is to (1) assess the feasibility of predicting increases in Facebook usage frequency, (2) evaluate which algorithms perform best, (3) and determine which predictors are most important. We benchmark the performance of Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Stochastic Adaptive Boosting, Kernel Factory, Neural Networks and Support Vector Machines using five times twofold cross-validation. The results indicate that it is feasible to create models with high predictive performance. The top performing algorithm was Stochastic Adaptive Boosting with a cross-validated AUC of 0.66 and accuracy of 0.74. The most important predictors include deviation from regular usage patterns, frequencies of likes of specific categories and group memberships, average photo album privacy settings, and recency of comments. Facebook and other social networks alike could use predictions of increases in usage frequency to customize its services such as pacing the rate of advertisements and friend recommendations, or adapting News Feed content altogether. The main contribution of this study is that it is the first to assess the prediction of increases in usage frequency in a social network. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The analytic network process (ANP) is a methodology for multi-criteria decision making used to derive priorities of the compared elements in a network hierarchy, where the dependences and feedback within and between the elements can be considered. However, the ANP is limited to the input preferences as crisp judgments, which is often unfavorable in practical applications. As an extension of the ANP, a generalized analytic network process (G-ANP) is developed to allow multiple forms of preferences, such as crisp (fuzzy) judgments, interval (interval fuzzy) judgments, hesitant (hesitant fuzzy) judgments and stochastic (stochastic fuzzy) judgments. In the G-ANP, a concept of complex comparison matrices (CCMs) is developed to collect decision makers' preferences in the multiple forms. From a stochastic point of view, we develop an eigenvector method based stochastic preference method (EVM-SPM) to derive priorities from CCMs. The main steps of the G-ANP are summarized, and the implementation of the G-ANP in Matlab and Excel environments are given in detail, which is also a prototype for a decision support system. A real-life example of the piracy risk assessment to the energy channels of China is proposed to demonstrate the G-ANP. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB We consider restoring multiple interdependent infrastructure networks after a disaster damages components in them and disrupts the services provided by them. Our particular focus is on interdependent infrastructure restoration (IIR) where both the operations and the restoration of the infrastructures are linked across systems. We provide new mathematical formulations of restoration interdependencies in order to incorporate them into an interdependent integrated network design and scheduling (IINDS) problem. The IIR efforts resulting from solving this IINDS problem model a centralized decision-making environment where a single decision-maker controls the resources of all infrastructures. In reality, individual infrastructures often determine their restoration efforts in an independent, decentralized manner with little communication among them. We provide algorithms to model various levels of decentralization in IIR efforts. These algorithms are applied to realistic damage scenarios for interdependent infrastructure systems in order to determine the loss in restoration effectiveness resulting from decentralized decision-making. Our computational tests demonstrate that this loss can be greatly mitigated by having infrastructures share information about their planned restoration efforts. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB This paper investigates the coordinated scheduling problem of production and transportation in a two-stage supply chain, where the actual job processing time is a linear function of its starting time. During the production stage the jobs are first processed in serial batches on a bounded serial batching machine at the manufacturer's site. Then, the batches are delivered to a customer by a single vehicle with limited capacity during the transportation stage, and the vehicle can only deliver one batch at one time. The objective of this proposed scheduling problem is to make decisions on job batching and batch sequencing so as to minimize the makespan. Moreover, we consider two different models. With regards to the scheduling model with a buffer for storing the processed batches before transportation, we develop an optimal algorithm to solve it. For the scheduling model without buffer, we present some useful properties and develop a heuristic H for solving it. Then a novel lower bound is derived and two optimal algorithms are designed for solving two special cases. Furthermore, computational experiments with random instances of different sizes are conducted to evaluate the proposed heuristic H, and the results show that our proposed algorithm is superior to other four approaches in the literature. Besides, heuristic H in our experiments can effectively and efficiently solve both small-size and large-size problems in a reasonable time. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Sparse optimization refers to an optimization problem involving the zero-norm in objective or constraints. In this paper, nonconvex approximation approaches for sparse optimization have been studied with a unifying point of view in DC (Difference of Convex functions) programming framework. Considering a common DC approximation of the zero-norm including all standard sparse inducing penalty functions, we studied the consistency between global minimums (resp. local minimums) of approximate and original problems. We showed that, in several cases, some global minimizers (resp. local minimizers) of the approximate problem are also those of the original problem. Using exact penalty techniques in DC programming, we proved stronger results for some particular approximations, namely, the approximate problem, with suitable parameters, is equivalent to the original problem. The efficiency of several sparse inducing penalty functions have been fully analyzed. Four DCA (DC Algorithm) schemes were developed that cover all standard algorithms in nonconvex sparse approximation approaches as special versions. They can be viewed as, an l(1)-perturbed algorithm/reweighted-l(1) algorithm / reweighted-l(2) algorithm. We offer a unifying nonconvex approximation approach, with solid theoretical tools as well as efficient algorithms based on DC programming and DCA, to tackle the zero-norm and sparse optimization. As an application, we implemented our methods for the feature selection in SVM (Support Vector Machine) problem and performed empirical comparative numerical experiments on the proposed algorithms with various approximation functions.

We demonstrate the approach on the TSP. We define the TSP race problem, present a computation-implementation parallelized (CIP) approach for solving it, and demonstrate CIP's effectiveness on TSP Race instances. We also demonstrate a method for determining a priori when CIP will be effective. Although in this paper we focus on TSP, our general CIP approach can be effective on other problems and applications with similar time sensitivity. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB We study various two-agent scheduling problems on a single machine with equal job processing times. The equal processing time assumption enables us to design new polynomial-time or faster-than-known optimization algorithms for many problems. We prove, however, that there exists a subset of problems for which the computational complexity remains NP-hard. The set of hard problems includes different variations where the objective functions of the two agents are either minimizing the weighted sum of completion times or the weighted number of tardy jobs. For these problems, we present pseudo-polynomial time algorithms. Crown Copyright (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Despite the fact that the Capacitated Arc Routing Problems (CARPs) received substantial attention in the literature, most of the research concentrates on the symmetric and single-depot version of the problem. In this paper, we fill this gap by proposing an approach to solving a more general version of the problem and analysing its properties. We present an MILP formulation that accommodates asymmetric multi-depot case and consider valid inequalities that may be used to tighten its LP relaxation. A symmetry breaking scheme for a single-depot case is also proposed. An extensive numerical study is carried to investigate the properties of the problem and the proposed solution approach.

AB In this paper, we conduct a study of the job-shop scheduling problem with reverse flows. This NP-hard problem is characterized by two flows of jobs that cover the same machines in opposite directions. The objective is to minimize the maximal completion time of the jobs (i.e., the makespan).
   We start by analyzing the complexity and identifying particular cases of the problem. Then, we provide a mathematical model that we use in conjunction with a solver to determine the computational times. These times are often too long because the problem is NP-hard. Thus, in this paper, we present a new heuristic method for solving the NP-hard 3-machine case. We evaluate the performance of this heuristic by computing several lower bounds and conducting tests on a Taillard-based benchmark. These tests give satisfying results and show that the heuristic ensures good performance when the two flows have comparable numbers of jobs. Then, we suggest a hybrid method that consists of a combination between a heuristic and a solver-based procedure to address the m-machine problem. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This paper studies the optimal investment strategies of an incumbent and a potential entrant that can both choose between a product flexible and dedicated technology, in a two-product market characterized by uncertain demand. The product flexible production technology has certain advantages, especially when the economic environment is uncertain. On the other hand, the dedicated production technology allows a firm to commit to production quantities. This gives strategic advantages, which can outweigh the 'value of flexibility'.
   It turns out that both firms prefer, for some scenarios, the dedicated production technology. However, we find that in a game with sequential technology choices, both firms investing dedicated, will not be an equilibrium. Especially when the economic environment is more uncertain, the incumbent overinvests in product flexible capacity to force the entrant to choose the dedicated technology. Then, the incumbent is the only firm with the product flexible production technology, which results in a high payoff. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

DE Dynamic inventory rationing; Multiple classes stochastic demands;

ID STOCK PRODUCTION SYSTEM; LOST SALES; POLICY; MODEL; QUEUE
AB Dynamic inventory rationing is considered for systems with multiple demand classes, stationary stochastic demands, and backordering. In the literature, dynamic programming has been often applied to address this type of problems. However, due to the curse of dimensionality, computation is a critical challenge for dynamic programming. In this paper, an innovative two-step approach is proposed based on an idea similar to the certainty equivalence principle. First the deterministic inventory rationing problem is studied, where the future demands are set to be the expectation of the stochastic demand processes. The important properties obtained from solving the problem with the KKT conditions are then used to develop effective dynamic rationing policies for stochastic demands, which gives closed-form expressions for dynamic rationing thresholds. These expressions are easy to calculate and are applicable to any number of demand classes. Numerical results show that the expressions are close to and provide a lower bound for the optimal dynamic thresholds. They also shed light on important managerial insights, for example, the relation between different parameters and the rationing thresholds. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

However, the impact of contamination has still not been thoroughly studied from a supply chain planning perspective. This paper models a contamination event in a generic food supply chain consisting of suppliers, processing centers, and retailers. Contamination is detected through either company or government agency sampling tests or through reports of a food borne illness. In this research, we analyze the impact of origin and choice of sampling strategies, and product and supply chain attributes on a contamination event. We also simulate a real-world tomato contamination case to gain further insights. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In this paper, we consider issues of sustainability in the context of joint trade credit and inventory management in which the demand depends on the length of the credit period offered by the retailer to its customers. We quantify the impacts of the credit period and environmental regulations on the inventory model. Starting with some mild assumptions, we first analyze the model with generalized demand and default risk rates under the Carbon Cap-and-Trade policy, and then we make some extensions to the model with the Carbon Offset policy. We further analytically examine the effects of carbon emission parameters on the retailer's trade credit and replenishment strategies. Finally, a couple of numerical examples and sensitivity analysis are given to illustrate the features of the proposed model, which is followed by concluding remarks. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

DE Data envelopment analysis; Weight restrictions; Production trade-offs
ID PRODUCTION TRADE-OFFS; EFFICIENCY; MODELS; TARGETS; BOUNDS
AB It has recently been shown that the incorporation of weight restrictions in models of data envelopment analysis (DEA) may induce free or unlimited production of output vectors in the underlying production technology, which is expressly disallowed by standard production assumptions. This effect may either result in an infeasible multiplier model with weight restrictions or remain undetected by normal efficiency computations. The latter is potentially troubling because even if the efficiency scores appear unproblematic, they may still be assessed in an erroneous model of production technology. Two approaches to testing the existence of free and unlimited production have recently been developed: computational and analytical. While the latter is more straightforward than the former, its application is limited only to unlinked weight restrictions. In this paper we develop several new analytical conditions for a larger class of unlinked and linked weight restrictions. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The failure processes of repairable systems may be impacted by operational and environmental stress factors. To accommodate such factors, reliability can be modelled using a multiplicative intensity function. In the proportional intensity model, the failure intensity is the product of the failure intensity function of the baseline system that quantifies intrinsic factors and a function of covariates that quantify extrinsic factors. The existing literature has extensively studied the failure processes of repairable systems using general repair concepts such as age-reduction when no covariate effects are considered. This paper investigates different approaches for modelling the failure and repair process of repairable systems in the presence of time-dependent covariates. We derive probabilistic properties of the failure processes for such systems. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This paper presents a discrete-time single-server finite-buffer queue with Markovian arrival process and generally distributed batch-size-dependent service time. Given that infinite service time is not commonly encountered in practical situations, we suppose that the distribution of the service time has a finite support. Recently, a similar continuous-time system with Poisson input process was discussed by Banerjee and Gupta (2012). But unfortunately, their method is hard to apply in the analysis of discrete-time case with versatile Markovian point process due to the fact that the difference equation governing the boundary state probabilities is more complex than the continuous one. If we follow their ideas, we will eventually find that some important joint queue length distributions cannot be computed and thus some key performance measures cannot be derived. In this paper, replacing the finite support renewal distribution with an appropriate phase-type distribution, the joint state probabilities at various time epochs (arbitrary, pre-arrival and departure) have been obtained by using matrix analytic method and embedded Markov chain technique. Furthermore, UL-type RG-factorization is employed in numerical computation of block-structured Markov chains with finitely-many levels. Some numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed algorithm for several service time distributions. Moreover, the impact of the correlation factor on loss probability and mean sojourn time is also investigated. (C) 2015 Elsevier BY. All rights reserved.

AB In this paper, we first propose a portfolio management model where the objective is to balance equity and liability. The asset price dynamics includes both permanent and temporary price impact, where the permanent impact is a linear function of the cumulative trading amount and the temporary impact is a kth (between 0 and 1) order power function of the instantaneous trading rate. We construct efficient frontiers to visualize the tradeoff between equity and liability and obtain analytical properties regarding the optimal trading strategies. In the second part, we further consider an optimal deleveraging problem with leverage constraints. It reduces to a non-convex polynomial optimization program with polynomial and box constraints. A Lagrangian method for solving the problem is presented and the quality of the solution is studied. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Retail activities are increasingly exposed to unseasonal weather causing lost sales and profits, as climate change is aggravating climate variability. Although research has provided insights into the role of weather on consumption, little is known about the precise relationship between weather and sales for strategic and financial decision-making. Using apparel as an illustration, for all seasons, we estimate the impact on sales caused by unexpected deviations of daily temperature from seasonal patterns. We apply Seasonal Trend decomposition using Loess to isolate changes in sales volumes. We use a linear regression to find the relationship between temperature and sales anomalies and construct the historical distribution to determine sales-at-risk due to unseasonal weather. We show how to use weather derivatives to offset the potential loss. Our contribution is twofold. We provide a new general method for managers to understand how their performance is weather-related. We lay out a blueprint for tailor-made weather derivatives to mitigate this risk. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The global minimum variance portfolio computed using the sample covariance matrix is known to be negatively affected by parameter uncertainty, an important component of model risk. Using a robust approach, we introduce a portfolio rule for investors who wish to invest in the global minimum variance portfolio due to its strong historical track record, but seek a rule that is robust to parameter uncertainty. Our robust portfolio corresponds theoretically to the global minimum variance portfolio in the worst-case scenario, with respect to a set of plausible alternative estimators of the covariance matrix, in the neighbourhood of the sample covariance matrix. Hence, it provides protection against errors in the reference sample covariance matrix. Monte Carlo simulations illustrate the dominance of the robust portfolio over its non-robust counterpart, in terms of portfolio stability, variance and risk-adjusted returns. Empirically, we compare the out-of-sample performance of the robust portfolio to various competing minimum variance portfolio rules in the literature. We observe that the robust portfolio often has lower turnover and variance and higher Sharpe ratios than the competing minimum variance portfolios. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

As a generalization of the standard monotonicity and recently introduced weak monotonicity, we introduce and study the directional monotonicity of fusion functions. For distinguished fusion functions the sets of all directions in which they are increasing are determined. Moreover, in the paper the directional monotonicity of piecewise linear fusion functions is completely characterized. These results cover, among others, weighted arithmetic means, OWA operators, the Choquet, Sugeno and Shilkret integrals. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Airlines commonly experience the problem that the sum of freight forwarders' orders exceeds the airline's fixed capacity for hot-selling routes, while the orders are usually <50 percent for underutilized routes. Airlines cannot dynamically change flights to address the imbalance, since they have to serve passenger traffic when carrying cargo in the belly space of passenger flights. The imbalance problem is likely to become even more severe when the number of wide-body passenger aircraft increases in the near future, as expected by the International Air Transport Association (IATA). Motivated by a joint project with a large airline, we propose a tying mechanism for capacity allocation by integrating hot-selling routes and underutilized routes. The strategic foreclosure theory is adopted in the proposed mechanism. Some forwarders are selected as the partners to whom more capacity of hot-selling routes are allocated with the condition that they will order more underutilized routes. Other "excluded" forwarders temporarily operate underutilized routes. By observing the cost structure information of forwarders, we design the tying mechanism for air cargo capacity allocation and derive the closed-form optimal solution. Using data from the airline, we demonstrate that the proposed tying capacity allocation mechanism is very effective. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Many public healthcare systems struggle with excessive waiting lists for elective patient treatment. Different countries address this problem in different ways, and one interesting method entails a maximum waiting time guarantee. Introduced in Denmark in 2002, it entitles patients to treatment at a private hospital in Denmark or at a hospital abroad if the public healthcare system is unable to provide treatment within the stated maximum waiting time guarantee. Although clearly very attractive in some respects, many stakeholders have been very concerned about the negative consequences of the policy on the utilization of public hospital resources. This paper illustrates the use of a queue modelling approach in the analysis of elective patient treatment governed by the maximum waiting time policy. Drawing upon the combined strengths of analytic and simulation approaches we develop both Continuous-Time Markov Chain and Discrete Event Simulation models, to provide an insightful analysis of the public hospital performance under the policy rules. The aim of this paper is to support the enhancement of the quality of elective patient care, to be brought about by better understanding of the policy implications by hospital planners and strategic decision makers.

AB Operational Research (OR) techniques have been applied, from the early stages of the discipline, to a wide variety of issues in education. At the government level, these include questions of what resources should be allocated to education as a whole and how these should be divided amongst the individual sectors of education and the institutions within the sectors. Another pertinent issue concerns the efficient operation of institutions, how to measure it, and whether resource allocation can be used to incentivise efficiency savings. Local governments, as well as being concerned with issues of resource allocation, may also need to make decisions regarding, for example, the creation and location of new institutions or closure of existing ones, as well as the day-to-day logistics of getting pupils to schools. Issues of concern for managers within schools and colleges include allocating the budgets, scheduling lessons and the assignment of students to courses. This survey provides an overview of the diverse problems faced by government, managers and consumers of education, and the OR techniques which have typically been applied in an effort to improve operations and provide solutions.

AB This paper addresses the capacitated vehicle routing problem with two-dimensional loading constraints (2L-CVRP), which is a generalized capacitated vehicle routing problem in which customer demand is a set of two-dimensional, rectangular, weighted items. The objective is to design the route set of minimum cost for a homogenous fleet of vehicles, starting and terminating at a central depot, to serve all the customers. All the items packed in one vehicle must satisfy the two-dimensional orthogonal packing constraints. A variable neighborhood search is proposed to address the routing aspect, and a skyline heuristic is adapted to examine the loading constraints. To speed up the search process, an efficient data structure (Trie) is utilized to record the loading feasibility information of routes, but also to control the computational effort of the skyline spending on the same route. The effectiveness of our approach is verified through experiments on widely used benchmark instances involving two distinct versions of loading constraints (unrestricted and sequential versions). Numerical experiments show that the proposed method outperforms all existing methods and improves or matches the majority of best known solutions for both problem versions. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB In a multi-component system, the assumption of failure independence among components is seldom valid, especially for those complex systems with complicated failure mechanism. For such systems, warranty cost is subject to all the factors including system configuration, quality of each component and the extent of failure dependence among components. In this paper, a model is developed based on renewing free-replacement warranty by considering failure interaction among components. It is assumed that whenever a component (subsystem) fails, it can induce a failure of one or more of the remaining components (subsystems). Cost models for series and parallel system configurations are presented, followed by numerical examples with sensitivity analysis. The results show that, compared with series systems, warranty cost for parallel systems is more sensitive to failure interaction. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The problem of dynamic portfolio choice with transaction costs is often addressed by constructing a Markov Chain approximation of the continuous time price processes. Using this approximation, we present an efficient numerical method to determine optimal portfolio strategies under time- and state-dependent drift and proportional transaction costs. This scenario arises when investors have behavioral biases or the actual drift is unknown and needs to be estimated. Our numerical method solves dynamic optimal portfolio problems with an exponential utility function for time-horizons of up to 40 years. It is applied to measure the value of information and the loss from transaction costs using the indifference principle. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ID INCREASING RETURNS
AB This paper develops a stylized (or conceptual) system optimization model to analyze the adoption of an emerging infrastructure associated with uncertain technological learning and spatial reconfigurations. The model first assumes that the emerging infrastructure will be implemented for the entire system when it is adopted. With the model, this paper explores (1) how the emerging infrastructure's initial investment cost, technological learning and its uncertainty, market size, and efficiency influence the adoption of the emerging infrastructure and (2) how the efficiency and investment cost of the associated technology (which will be located in a different place with the adoption of the emerging infrastructure) influence the adoption of the emerging infrastructure. Then, this paper extends the model and explores whether it is a better solution to implement the emerging infrastructure for part of the distance from resource site to demand site if its efficiency is a function of the implemented distance. With optimizations under three types of efficiency dynamics, this paper finds that whether the emerging infrastructure should be implemented partly or entirely is not determined by the value of its efficiency but by the dynamics of its efficiency.

AB Patriksson (2008) provided a then up-to-date survey on the continuous, separable, differentiable and convex resource allocation problem with a single resource constraint. Since the publication of that paper the interest in the problem has grown: several new applications have arisen where the problem at hand constitutes a subproblem, and several new algorithms have been developed for its efficient solution. This paper therefore serves three purposes. First, it provides an up-to-date extension of the survey of the literature of the field, complementing the survey in Patriksson (2008) with more then 20 books and articles. Second, it contributes improvements of some of these algorithms, in particular with an improvement of the pegging (that is, variable fixing) process in the relaxation algorithm, and an improved means to evaluate subsolutions. Third, it numerically evaluates several relaxation (primal) and breakpoint (dual) algorithms, incorporating a variety of pegging strategies, as well as a quasi-Newton method. Our conclusion is that our modification of the relaxation algorithm performs the best. At least for problem sizes up to 30 million variables the practical time complexity for the breakpoint and relaxation algorithms is linear. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This article presents a practicable algorithm for globally solving sum of linear ratios problem (SLR). The algorithm works by globally solving a bilinear programming problem (EQ) that is equivalent to the problem (SLR). In the algorithm, by utilizing convex envelope and concave envelope of bilinear function, the initial nonconvex programming problem is reduced to a sequence of linear relaxation programming problems. In order to improve the computational efficiency of the algorithm, a new accelerating technique is introduced, which provides a theoretical possibility to delete a large part of the investigated region in which there exists no global optimal solution of the (EQ). By combining this innovative technique with branch and bound operations, a global optimization algorithm is designed for solving the problem (SLR). Finally, numerical experimental results show the feasibility and efficiency of the proposed algorithm. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

   CHAINS; CONSTRAINTS
AB In this paper, we investigate a new variant of the vehicle routing problem (VRP), termed the multi-period vehicle routing problem with time windows and limited visiting quota (MVRPTW-LVQ), which requires that any customer can be served by at most a certain number of different vehicles over the planning horizon. We first formulate this problem as a mixed integer programming model and then devise a three-stage heuristic approach to solve the problem. Extensive computational experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Moreover, we empirically analyze the impacts of varying the levels of service consistency and demand fluctuation on the operational cost. The analysis results show that when demand fluctuation is relatively small compared to vehicle capacity, enforcing consistent service can increase customer satisfaction with only a slight increase in the operational cost. However, when a vehicle can only serve a small number of customers due to its capacity limit, relaxing the service consistency requirement by increasing the value of the visiting quota could be considered.

ID INTERSECTION CUTS; GOMORY CUTS; INTEGER; PROGRAMS
AB We analyze split cuts from the perspective of cut generating functions via geometric lifting. We show that a-cuts, a natural higher-dimensional generalization of the k-cuts of Cornuejols et al., give all the split cuts for the mixed-integer corner relaxation. As an immediate consequence we obtain that the k-cuts are equivalent to split cuts for the 1-row mixed-integer relaxation. Further, we show that split cuts for finite-dimensional corner relaxations are restrictions of split cuts for the infinite-dimensional relaxation. In a final application of this equivalence, we exhibit a family of pure-integer programs whose split closure has arbitrarily bad integrality gap. This complements the mixed-integer example provided by Basu et al. (2011). (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ID TRAVELING SALESMAN PROBLEM
AB This paper approaches a pickup and delivery problem with multiple vehicles in which LIFO conditions are imposed when performing loading and unloading operations and the route durations cannot exceed a given limit. We propose two mixed integer formulations of this problem and a heuristic procedure that uses tabu search in a multi-start framework. The first formulation is a compact one, that is, the number of variables and constraints is polynomial in the number of requests, while the second one contains an exponential number of constraints and is used as the basis of a branch-and-cut algorithm. The performances of the proposed solution methods are evaluated through an extensive computational study using instances of different types that were created by adapting existing benchmark instances. The proposed exact methods are able to optimally solve instances with up to 60 nodes. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Given a graph G and a positive integer K, the inverse chromatic number problem consists in modifying the graph as little as possible so that it admits a chromatic number not greater than K. In this paper, we focus on the inverse chromatic number problem for certain classes of graphs. First, we discuss diverse possible versions and then focus on two application frameworks which motivate this problem in interval and permutation graphs: the inverse booking problem and the inverse track assignment problem. The inverse booking problem is closely related to some previously known scheduling problems; we propose new hardness results and polynomial cases. The inverse track assignment problem motivates our study of the inverse chromatic number problem in permutation graphs; we show how to solve in polynomial time a generalization of the problem with a bounded number of colors.

Among the predominant topics treated in the literature, we focus on two different, but related problem classes. One can be described by the notion of network design, while the other is more aptly termed by network operation. The basic underlying model in both cases is a nonlinear network flow model, and we give an overview on the more specific modeling aspects in each case. The overall mathematical model is a Mixed Integer Nonlinear Program having a common structure with respect to how water dynamics in pipes are described. Finally, we survey the algorithmic approaches to solve the proposed problems and we discuss computation on various types of water networks. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

It develops a mixed-integer nonlinear optimization model to minimize the total cost consisting of ship cost, bunker cost, and inventory cost, under the worst-case bunker consumption scenario. A close-form expression for the worst-case bunker consumption is derived and three linearization techniques are proposed to transform the nonlinear model to a mixed-integer linear programming formulation. A case study based on the Asia-Europe-Oceania network of a global liner shipping company demonstrates the applicability of the proposed model and interesting managerial insights are obtained.

AB This paper offers insights into how the bullwhip effect in two parallel supply chains with interacting price-sensitive demands is affected in contrast to the situation of a single product in a serial supply chain. In particular, this research studies two parallel supply chains, each consisting of a manufacturer and a retailer, and the external demand for a single product depends on its price and the other's price in a situation in which each price follows a first-order autoregressive process. In this paper, we propose an analytical framework that incorporates two parallel supply chains, and we explore their interactions to determine the bullwhip effect. We identify the conditions under which the bullwhip effect is amplified or lessened with interacting price-sensitive demands relative to the situation without interaction. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB We consider a discrete-time inventory system for a perishable product where demand exists for product of different ages; an example of such a product is blood platelets. In addition to the classical costs for inventory holding, outdating, and shortage, our model includes substitution (mismatch) costs incurred when a demand for a certain-aged item is satisfied by a different-aged item. We propose a simple inventory replenishment and allocation heuristic to minimize the expected total cost over an infinite time horizon. In our heuristic, inventory of the newest items is replenished in fixed quantities and the newest items are protected for future use by limiting some substitutions when making allocation decisions according to a critical-level policy. We model our problem as a Markov Decision Process (MDP), derive the costs of our heuristic policy, and computationally compare this policy to extant "near optimal" policies in the literature. Our extensive computational study shows that our policy leads to superior performance compared to existing heuristics in the literature, particularly when supplies are limited. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB This study investigates the look-ahead control of a conveyor-serviced production station (CSPS), viewed as a production center, which is connected to a sales center. The production station is equipped with a buffer to temporarily store the parts that will flow into the product bank of the sales center after processing. The whole two-center system is characterized by random parts arrival, random customer demand, random processing time and limited buffer or bank capacities. Thus, the decision-making on the look-ahead range of such demand-driven CSPS is subject to the constraints of production and sales levels. In this paper, we will focus on modeling the stochastic control problem and providing solutions for finding the optimal look-ahead control policy under either average- or discounted-cost criteria. We first establish a detailed semi-Markov decision process for the look-ahead control of the demand-driven CSPS by combining the vacancies of both the buffer and the bank into one state, which can be solved by policy iteration or value iteration if the system parameters are known precisely. Then, to avoid the curse of dimensionality and modeling in the numerical optimization methods, we also propose a Q-learning algorithm combined with a simulated annealing technique to derive the approximate solutions.

AB In recent years, large amounts of financial data have become available for analysis. We propose exploring returns from 21 European stock markets by model-based clustering of regime switching models. These econometric models identify clusters of time series with similar dynamic patterns and moreover allow relaxing assumptions of existing approaches, such as the assumption of conditional Gaussian returns. The proposed model handles simultaneously the heterogeneity across stock markets and over time, i.e., time-constant and time-varying discrete latent variables capture unobserved heterogeneity between and within stock markets, respectively. The results show a clear distinction between two groups of stock markets, each one characterized by different regime switching dynamics that correspond to different expected return-risk patterns. We identify three regimes: the so-called bull and bear regimes, as well as a stable regime with returns close to 0, which turns out to be the most frequently occurring regime. This is consistent with stylized facts in financial econometrics. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Based on the concept of sparse connection, three start-up demonstration tests with sparse connection are introduced which are called CSTF with sparse d(1) TSCF with sparse d(2) and CSCF with sparse d(3) and d(4). The traditional start-up demonstration tests such as CSTF, TSCF and CSCF are special cases of these new tests. Furthermore, the new tests exhibit obvious improvement in test efficiency. In this paper, by using the finite Markov chain imbedding approach, several probabilistic indexes are given for these new start-up demonstration tests based on the assumption that the tests are i.i.d. case. The analyses are also extended to independent and non-identical and Markov dependent cases. In addition, procedures are provided in order to determine the optimal parameters needed in a demonstration test for selecting the products to meet the reliability requirement. Three comparison analyses are finally presented in order to illustrate the high efficiency of these new start-up demonstration tests and the effectiveness of this method. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

ID STOCHASTIC VOLATILITY; MARKET; STRATEGIES
AB The optimal-exercise policy of an American option dictates when the option should be exercised. In this paper, we consider the implications of missing the optimal exercise time of an American option. For the put option, this means holding the option until it is deeper in-the-money when the optimal decision would have been to exercise instead. We derive an upper bound on the maximum possible loss incurred by such an option holder. This upper bound requires no knowledge of the optimal-exercise policy or true price function. This upper bound is a function of only the option-holder's exercise strategy and the intrinsic value of the option. We show that this result holds true for both put and call options under a variety of market models ranging from the simple Black-Scholes model to complex stochastic-volatility jump-diffusion models. Numerical illustrations of this result are provided. We then use this result to study numerically how the cost of delaying exercise varies across market models and call and put options. We also use this result as a tool to numerically investigate the relation between an option-holder's risk-preference levels and the maximum possible loss he may incur when adopting a target-payoff policy that is a function of his risk-preference level.

TI Optimal technology adoption when the arrival rate of new technologies
   changes
SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF OPERATIONAL RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
DE Innovation; Capital budgets; Optimal control models
ID INFORMATION; MODELS
AB Our paper contributes to the literature of technology adoption. In most of these models it is assumed that the intensity rate of new arrivals is constant. We extend this approach by assuming that after the last technology jump the intensity of a new arrival can change. Right after the arrival of a new technology the intensity equals a specific value that switches if no new technology arrival has taken place within a certain period after the last technology arrival. We look at different scenarios, dependent on whether the firm is threatened by a drop in the arrival rate after a certain time period or expects the rate to rise.
   We analyze the effect of a mean preserving spread of the time between two consecutive arrivals on the optimal investment timing and show that larger variance can accelerate investment in case the arrival rate rises while it can decelerate investment in case the arrival rate drops. We find that firms often adopt a new technology a time lag after its introduction, which is a phenomenon frequently observed in practice. Regarding a firm's technology releasing strategy we explain why additional uncertainty can stimulate customers' buying behavior. The optimal adoption timing changes significantly, depending on whether the arrival rate is assumed to change or be constant over time.
   Adding uncertainty about the length of the time period after which the arrival intensity changes, we find that increasing uncertainty accelerates investment, a result that is opposite to the standard real options theory. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In this paper, we study the traveling umpire problem (TUP), a difficult combinatorial optimization problem that is formulated based on the key issues of Major League Baseball. We introduce an arc-flow model and a set partition model to formulate the problem. Based on these two models, we propose a branch-and-bound algorithm and a branch-and-price-and-cut algorithm. The branch-and-bound algorithm relies on lower bounds provided by a Lagrangian relaxation of the arc-flow model, while the branch-and-price-and-cut algorithm exploits lower bounds from the linear programming relaxation of the set partition model strengthened by a family of valid inequalities. In the branch-and-price-and-cut algorithm, we design an efficient label-setting algorithm to solve the pricing problem, and a branching strategy that combines three different branching rules. The two algorithms are tested on a set of well-known benchmark instances. The two exact algorithms are both able to rapidly solve instances with 10 teams or less, while the branch-and-price-and-cut algorithm can solve two instances with 14 teams. This is the first time that instances with 14 teams have been solved to optimality. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB We study a discontinuous mispricing model of a risky asset under asymmetric information where jumps in the asset price and mispricing are modelled by Levy processes. By contracting the filtration of the informed investor, we obtain optimal portfolios and maximum expected utilities for the informed and uninformed investors. We also discuss their asymptotic properties, which can be estimated using the instantaneous centralized moments of return. We find that optimal and asymptotic utilities are increased due to jumps in mispricing for the uninformed investor but the informed investor still has excess utility, provided there is not too little or too much mispricing.

LA English
DT Article
DE Risk management; Supply chain management; Contracts
ID SUPPLY CHAIN COORDINATION; COMMITMENTS; FLEXIBILITY
AB We introduce and study the range contract, which allows a buyer to procure from a supplier at a prescribed price any amount within a specified range. In return, the supplier is compensated up front for the width of the range with a range fee. This fee can be viewed as the buyer trading monetary value for reduced uncertainty. The range contract generalizes and unifies many common contracts, such as fixed-price, JIT, option, and quantityflexibility contracts. The parameters that maximize the expected profit of the centralized supply chain are derived here and are shown to crucially depend on production flexibility. We also study here the buyer's expected profit-maximizing range endpoints as a function of the pricing parameters of the contract. Using the buyer's optimal range, we demonstrate how the supplier can set the contract's pricing parameters so as to maximize the supplier's expected profit for a uniform distribution of demand. We provide computational evidence, for uniformly distributed demand, that the range contract allows the optimal decentralized supply chain to attain significant reductions in standard deviation of profit in exchange for moderate reductions in expected value of profit. We further demonstrate computationally that both the buyer and supplier can benefit simultaneously, attaining higher risk-adjusted profits than the centralized supply chain. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The efficiency of each participating nation in the entire two-stage Olympic process is calculated as a product of the efficiencies of both stages, and a heuristic search is applied to the extended relational model. The efficiency of each stage can be obtained and directions for improving the performance of participating nations in the two-stage Olympic process can be identified. An empirical study of the 2012 London Summer Olympic Games reveals that the efficiency of the AP stage is higher than that of the AC stage for the majority of participants. In addition, a plot of the relationship between these three efficiencies shows that the efficiency of the entire two-stage Olympic process is more significantly related to that of the AC stage than that of the AP stage.

AB The periodical fluctuation phenomenon appears in coal mine and other fields of government safety supervision. The paper provides a theoretical explanation by building an evolutionary game model between coal mine industry and governmental supervision institutions. Moreover, the paper provides a numerical example to demonstrate how the initial state and the costs (or gains) influence the fluctuation amplitude and the equilibrium position. We find that the initial state and the payoffs of different strategies are the two main determinants of periodical fluctuation phenomenon. The successful experience of coal mine safety supervision in China shows the importance of highly efficient government safety governance in developing countries. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB With increasing global concerns regarding energy management, the concept of the smart grid has become a particularly important interdisciplinary research topic. In order to continually monitor a power utility system and efficiently observe all of the states of electric nodes and branches on a smart grid, placing PMUs (phasor measurement units) at selected nodes on the grid can monitor the operation conditions of the entire power grid. This study investigates methods for minimizing the high installation costs of PMUs, in order to monitor the entire system using a set of PMUs according to the power observation rules. Notably, this problem of monitoring a power grid can be transformed into the OPP (optimal PMU placement) problem. The objective is to simultaneously minimize the number of PMUs and ensure the complete observability of the whole power grid. This combinatorial optimization problem has been shown to be NP-complete.
   In this paper, we propose a hybrid two-phase algorithm for this problem. The first phase of the algorithm quickly identifies a set of candidate locations of PMUs based on a graph-theoretic decomposition approach for the power domination problem in tree-type graphs. Then, we use a local search heuristic method to derive the minimum number of PMUs in the second phase. In addition to the practical model, this study also considers the ideal model, in which all load nodes are assumed to be zero injection. The numerical studies on various IEEE power test systems demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed algorithm in both the Models in regard to computational time and solution quality. In particular, in the ideal model, the number of PMUs required for the test systems can be significantly reduced. We also provide theoretical lower bounds on the number of installed PMUs in the ideal model and show that the derived solution can achieve the bound of the test systems. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB We propose and empirically test statistical approaches to debiasing judgmental corporate cash flow forecasts. Accuracy of cash flow forecasts plays a pivotal role in corporate planning as liquidity and foreign exchange risk management are based on such forecasts. Surprisingly, to our knowledge there is no previous empirical work on the identification, statistical correction, and interpretation of prediction biases in large enterprise financial forecast data in general, and cash flow forecasting in particular. Employing a unique set of empirical forecasts delivered by 34 legal entities of a multinational corporation over a multi-year period, we compare different forecast correction techniques such as Theil's method and approaches employing robust regression, both with various discount factors. Our findings indicate that rectifiable mean as well as regression biases exist for all business divisions of the company and that statistical correction increases forecast accuracy significantly. We show that the parameters estimated by the models for different business divisions can also be related to the characteristics of the business environment and provide valuable insights for corporate financial controllers to better understand, quantify, and feedback the biases to the forecasters aiming to systematically improve predictive accuracy over time.

AB In this paper, firm profit loss is decomposed as the sum of two terms related to the output price uncertainty (price expectation error and risk preference), plus one extra term expressing technical inefficiency. We then describe the implementation of our theoretical model in a robust data envelopment analysis (DEA) framework, which allows an effective and separate estimation of each term of the decomposition. In addition, we offer an operational tool to reveal producers' risk preferences. A 2009 database of French fattening pig farms is used as an illustration. Our results indicate that risk preference and technical inefficiency are the main sources of profit loss. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Pareto Local Search (PLS) is a simple and effective local search method for tackling multi-objective combinatorial optimization problems. It is also a crucial component of many state-of-the-art algorithms for such problems. However, PLS may be not very effective when terminated before completion. In other words, PLS has poor anytime behavior. In this paper, we study the effect that various PLS algorithmic components have on its anytime behavior. We show that the anytime behavior of PLS can be greatly improved by using alternative algorithmic components. We also propose Dynagrid, a dynamic discretization of the objective space that helps PIS to converge faster to a good approximation of the Pareto front and continue to improve it if more time is available. We perform a detailed empirical evaluation of the new proposals on the bi-objective traveling salesman problem and the bi-objective quadratic assignment problem. Our results demonstrate that the new PLS variants not only have significantly better anytime behavior than the original PLS, but also may obtain better results for longer computation time or upon completion.

AB Multi-objectivization has been used to solve several single objective problems with improved results over traditional genetically inspired optimization methods. Multi-objectivization reformulates the single objective problem into a multiple objective problem. The reformulated problem is then solved with a multiple objective method to obtain a resulting solution to the original problem. Multi-objectivization Via Decomposition (MVD) and the addition of novel objectives are the two major approaches used in multi-objectivization. This paper focuses on analysis of two major MVD methods: helper-objectives and complete decomposition. Helper-objectives decomposition methods identify one or more decomposed objectives that are used simultaneously with the main objective to focus attention on components of the decomposed objectives. Complete decomposition, unlike helper-objectives does not explicitly use the main objective and instead uses decomposed objectives that exhaustively cover all portions of the main objective. This work examines the relationship between helper-objective decompositions and complete decomposition using both an analytic and experimental methodology. Pareto dominance relationships are examined analytically to clarify the relationship between dominant solutions in both types of decompositions. These results more clearly characterize how solutions from the two approaches rank in Pareto-frontier based fitness algorithms such as NSGA-II. An empirical study on job shop scheduling problems shows how fitness signal and fitness noise are affected by the balance of decomposition size. Additionally we provide evidence that, for the settings and instances studied, complete decompositions have a better on-average performance when compared to analogous helper-objective decompositions. Lastly we examine the underlying forces that determine effective decomposition size. We argue that it is advantageous to use less balanced decompositions as within-decomposition conflict increases and as heuristic strength increases. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This paper generalizes the automated innovization framework using genetic programming in the context of higher-level innovization. Automated innovization is an unsupervised machine learning technique that can automatically extract significant mathematical relationships from Pareto-optimal solution sets. These resulting relationships describe the conditions for Pareto-optimality for the multi-objective problem under consideration and can be used by scientists and practitioners as thumb rules to understand the problem better and to innovate new problem solving techniques; hence the name innovization (innovation through optimization). Higher-level innovization involves performing automated innovization on multiple Pareto-optimal solution sets obtained by varying one or more problem parameters. The automated innovization framework was recently updated using genetic programming. We extend this generalization to perform higher-level automated innovization and demonstrate the methodology on a standard two-bar bi-objective truss design problem. The procedure is then applied to a classic case of inventory management with multi-objective optimization performed at both system and process levels. The applicability of automated innovization to this area should motivate its use in other avenues of operational research. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This paper deals with the Pollution-Routing Problem (PRP), a Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) with environmental considerations, recently introduced in the literature by Bektas and Laporte (2011) [Transportation Research Part B: Methodological 45 (8), 1232-1250]. The objective is to minimize operational and environmental costs while respecting capacity constraints and service time windows. Costs are based on driver wages and fuel consumption, which depends on many factors, such as travel distance and vehicle load. The vehicle speeds are considered as decision variables. They complement routing decisions, impacting the total cost, the travel time between locations, and thus the set of feasible routes. We propose a method which combines a local search-based metaheuristic with an integer programming approach over a set covering formulation and a recursive speed-optimization algorithm. This hybridization enables to integrate more tightly route and speed decisions. Moreover, two other "green" VRP variants, the Fuel Consumption VRP (FCVRP) and the Energy Minimizing VRP (EMVRP), are addressed, as well as the VRP with time windows (VRPTW) with distance minimization.

AB In today's competitive markets, most firms in United Kingdom and United States offer their products on trade credit to stimulate sales and reduce inventory. Trade credit is calculated based on time value of money on the purchase cost (i.e., discounted cash flow analysis). Recently, many researchers use discounted cash flow analysis only on the purchase cost but not on the revenue (which is significantly larger than the purchase cost) and the other costs. For a sound and rigorous analysis, we should use discounted cash flow analysis on revenue and costs. In addition, expiration date for a deteriorating item (e.g., bread, milk, and meat) is an important factor in consumer's purchase decision. However, little attention has been paid to the effect of expiration date. Hence, in this paper, we establish a supplier-retailer-customer supply chain model in which: (a) the retailer receives an up-stream trade credit from the supplier while grants a down-stream trade credit to customers, (b) the deterioration rate is non-decreasing over time and near 100 percent particularly close to its expiration date, and (c) discounted cash flow analysis is adopted for calculating all relevant factors: revenue and costs. The proposed model is an extension of more than 20 previous papers. We then demonstrate that the retailer's optimal credit period and cycle time not only exist but also are unique. Thus, the search of the optimal solution reduces to a local one. Finally, we run several numerical examples to illustrate the problem and gain managerial insights. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

DE TSP; Tour length estimation
ID TRAVELING-SALESMAN PROBLEM; VEHICLE
AB Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) tour length estimations can be used when it is not necessary to know an exact tour, e.g., when using certain heuristics to solve location-routing problems. The best estimation models in the TSP literature focus on random instances where the node dispersion is known; those that do not require knowledge of node dispersion are either less accurate or slower. In this paper, we develop a new regression-based tour length estimation model that is distribution-free, accurate, and fast, with a small standard deviation of the estimation errors. When the distribution of the node coordinates is known, it provides a close estimate of the well-known asymptotic tour length estimation formula of Beardwood et al. (1959); more importantly, when the distribution is unknown or non-integrable so Beardwood et al.'s estimation cannot be used, our model still provides good, fast tour length estimates.

AB This paper proposes a novel surrogate-model-based multiobjective evolutionary algorithm called Differential Evolution for Multiobjective Optimization based on Gaussian Process models (GP-DEMO). The algorithm is based on the newly defined relations for comparing solutions under uncertainty. These relations minimize the possibility of wrongly performed comparisons of solutions due to inaccurate surrogate model approximations. The GP-DEMO algorithm was tested on several benchmark problems and two computationally expensive real-world problems. To be able to assess the results we compared them with another surrogate-model-based algorithm called Generational Evolution Control (GEC) and with the Differential Evolution for Multiobjective Optimization (DEMO). The quality of the results obtained with GP-DEMO was similar to the results obtained with DEMO, but with significantly fewer exactly evaluated solutions during the optimization process. The quality of the results obtained with GEC was lower compared to the quality gained with GP-DEMO and DEMO, mainly due to wrongly performed comparisons of the inaccurately approximated solutions.

AB While the cross entropy methodology has been applied to a fair number of combinatorial optimization problems with a single objective, its adaptation to multiobjective optimization has been sporadic. We develop a multiobjective optimization cross entropy (MOCE) procedure for combinatorial optimization problems for which there is a linear relaxation (obtained by ignoring the integrality restrictions) that can be solved in polynomial time. The presence of a relaxation that can be solved with modest computational time is an important characteristic of the problems under consideration because our procedure is designed to exploit relaxed solutions. This is done with a strategy that divides the objective function space into areas and a mechanism that seeds these areas with relaxed solutions. Our main interest is to tackle problems whose solutions are represented by binary variables and whose relaxation is a linear program. Our tests with multiobjective knapsack problems and multiobjective assignment problems show the merit of the proposed procedure. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Multi-objective optimization algorithms aim at finding Pareto-optimal solutions. Recovering Pareto fronts or Pareto sets from a limited number of function evaluations are challenging problems. A popular approach in the case of expensive-to-evaluate functions is to appeal to metamodels. Kriging has been shown efficient as a base for sequential multi-objective optimization, notably through infill sampling criteria balancing exploitation and exploration such as the Expected Hypervolume Improvement. Here we consider Kriging metamodels not only for selecting new points, but as a tool for estimating the whole Pareto front and quantifying how much uncertainty remains on it at any stage of Kriging-based multi-objective optimization algorithms. Our approach relies on the Gaussian process interpretation of Kriging, and bases upon conditional simulations. Using concepts from random set theory, we propose to adapt the Vorob'ev expectation and deviation to capture the variability of the set of non-dominated points. Numerical experiments illustrate the potential of the proposed workflow, and it is shown on examples how Gaussian process simulations and the estimated Vorob'ev deviation can be used to monitor the ability of Kriging-based multi-objective optimization algorithms to accurately learn the Pareto front.

AB Multi-objectivization represents a current and promising research direction which has led to the development of more competitive search mechanisms. This concept involves the restatement of a single-objective problem in an alternative multi-objective form, which can facilitate the process of finding a solution to the original problem. Recently, this transformation was applied with success to the HP model, a simplified yet challenging representation of the protein structure prediction problem. The use of alternative multi-objective formulations, based on the decomposition of the original objective function of the problem, has significantly increased the performance of search algorithms. The present study goes further on this topic. With the primary aim of understanding and quantifying the potential effects of multi-objectivization, a detailed analysis is first conducted to evaluate the extent to which this problem transformation impacts on an important characteristic of the fitness landscape, neutrality. To the authors' knowledge, the effects of multi-objectivization have not been previously investigated by explicitly sampling and evaluating the neutrality of the fitness landscape. Although focused on the HP model, most of the findings of such an analysis can be extrapolated to other problem domains, contributing thus to the general understanding of multi-objectivization. Finally, this study presents a comparative analysis where the advantages of multi-objectivization are evaluated in terms of the performance of a basic evolutionary algorithm. Both the two- and three-dimensional variants of the HP model (based on the square and cubic lattices, respectively) are considered. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Decomposition based algorithms perform well when a suitable set of weights are provided; however determining a good set of weights a priori for real-world problems is usually not straightforward due to a lack of knowledge about the geometry of the problem. This study proposes a novel algorithm called preference-inspired co-evolutionary algorithm using weights (PICEA-w) in which weights are co-evolved with candidate solutions during the search process. The co-evolution enables suitable weights to be constructed adaptively during the optimisation process, thus guiding candidate solutions towards the Pareto optimal front effectively. The benefits of co-evolution are demonstrated by comparing PICEA-w against other leading decomposition based algorithms that use random, evenly distributed and adaptive weights on a set of problems encompassing the range of problem geometries likely to be seen in practice, including simultaneous optimisation of up to seven conflicting objectives. Experimental results show that PICEA-w outperforms the comparison algorithms for most of the problems and is less sensitive to the problem geometry. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Various preference-based multi-objective evolutionary algorithms have been developed to help a decision-maker search for his/her preferred solutions to multi-objective problems. In most of the existing approaches the decision-maker preferences are formulated either by mathematical expressions such as the utility function or simply by numerical values such as aspiration levels and weights. However, in some sense a decision-maker may find it easier to specify preferences visually by drawing rather than using numbers. This paper introduces such a method, namely, the brushing technique. Using this technique the decision-maker can specify his/her preferences easily by drawing in the objective space. Combining the brushing technique with one existing algorithm PICEA-g, we present a novel approach named iPICEA-g for an interactive decision-making. The performance of iPICEA-g is tested on a set of benchmark problems and is shown to be good. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Two methods for ranking of solutions of multi objective optimization problems are proposed in this paper. The methods can be used, e.g. by metaheuristics to select good solutions from a set of non dominated solutions. They are suitable for population based metaheuristics to limit the size of the population. It is shown theoretically that the ranking methods possess some interesting properties for such applications. In particular, it is shown that both methods form a total preorder and are both refinements of the Pareto dominance relation. An experimental investigation for a multi objective flow shop problem shows that the use of the new ranking methods in a Population-based Ant Colony Optimization algorithm and in a genetic algorithm leads to good results when compared to other methods.

AB Multi-objective optimization problems arise frequently in applications, but can often only be solved approximately by heuristic approaches. Evolutionary algorithms have been widely used to tackle multi-objective problems. These algorithms use different measures to ensure diversity in the objective space but are not guided by a formal notion of approximation. We present a framework for evolutionary multi-objective optimization that allows to work with a formal notion of approximation. This approximation-guided evolutionary algorithm (AGE) has a worst-case runtime linear in the number of objectives and works with an archive that is an approximation of the non-dominated objective vectors seen during the run of the algorithm. Our experimental results show that AGE finds competitive or better solutions not only regarding the achieved approximation, but also regarding the total hypervolume. For all considered test problems, even for many (i.e., more than ten) dimensions, AGE discovers a good approximation of the Pareto front. This is not the case for established algorithms such as NSGA-II, SPEA2, and SMS-EMOA. In this paper we compare AGE with two additional algorithms that use very fast hypervolume-approximations to guide their search. This significantly speeds up the runtime of the hypervolume-based algorithms, which now allows a comparison of the underlying selection schemes. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Building on recent work by the authors, we consider the problem of performing multiobjective optimization when the objective functions of a problem have differing evaluation times (or latencies). This has general relevance to applications since objective functions do vary greatly in their latency, and there is no reason to expect equal latencies for the objectives in a single problem. To deal with this issue, we provide a general problem definition and suitable notation for describing algorithm schemes that can use different evaluation budgets for each objective. We propose three schemes for the hi-objective version of the problem, including methods that interleave the evaluations of different objectives. All of these can be instantiated with existing multiobjective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs).
   In an empirical study we use an indicator-based evolutionary algorithm (IBEA) as the MOEA platform to study performance on several benchmark test functions. Our findings generally show that the default approach of going at the rate of the slow objective is not competitive with our more advanced ones (interleaving evaluations) for most scenarios.

AB This paper addresses the problem of minimizing the total tardiness of a set of jobs to be scheduled on identical parallel machines where jobs can only be delivered at certain fixed delivery dates. Scheduling problems with fixed delivery dates are frequent in industry, for example when a manufacturer has to rely on the timetable of a logistics provider to ship its products to customers. We develop and empirically evaluate both optimal and heuristic solution procedures to solve the problem. As the problem is NP-hard, only relatively small instances can be optimally solved in reasonable computational time using either an efficient mathematical programming formulation or a branch-and-bound algorithm. Consequently, we develop a tabu search and a hybrid genetic algorithm to quickly find good approximate solutions for larger instances. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The primary objective in the one-dimensional cutting stock problem is to minimize material cost. In real applications it is often necessary to consider auxiliary objectives, one of which is to reduce the number of different cutting patterns (setups). This paper first presents an integer linear programming model to minimize the sum of material and setup costs over a given pattern set, and then describes a sequential grouping procedure to generate the patterns in the set. Two sets of benchmark instances are used in the computational test. The results indicate that the approach is efficient in improving the solution quality. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

   theory; Service level; Tardiness; Operations management
ID PRODUCTION SYSTEM; DUE-DATES; QUOTATION; MANAGEMENT; DEMAND
AB The influence of applying queue state dependent order acceptance policies, where either decision is with customer or with manufacturer, on optimal capacity investment is discussed. Therefore, three order acceptance policies are developed where either the customer has a certain service level threshold for each order or the manufacturer has an overall service level threshold. The third policy, modeling queue state independent order acceptance, is used to identify performance gains of including queue state knowledge into this decision. Equations for state probabilities, order acceptance rate, work-in-process, finished-goods-inventory, backorders and service level are developed for a system with stochastic customer-required lead times applying queuing methodology. An optimization problem minimizing capacity, work-in-process, finished-goods-inventory, backorder and lost sales cost (for rejected orders) in a single stage MTO production system is presented. The system is modeled as an M/M/1 queue with input rates depending on queue length and random customer required lead time. For the optimization problem, which cannot be solved explicitly, a solution heuristic is developed and a broad numerical study is conducted. The numerical study shows that allowing the customer to know the expected production lead time and-based on this knowledge-decide whether or not to place an order can have positive or negative influences on the overall costs, depending on the customer's service level target. Furthermore, the study shows that a high cost reduction potential exists for simultaneously optimizing capacity investment and order acceptance policy if the production system can decide whether or not to accept an order.

AB Inventory sharing among decentralized retailers has been widely used in practice to improve profitability and reduce risks at the same time. We study the coordination of a decentralized inventory sharing system with n (n > 2) retailers who non-cooperatively determine their order quantities but cooperatively share their inventory. There has been very limited research on coordinating such a system due to the many unique challenges involved, e.g., incomplete residual sharing, formation of subcoalitions for inventory sharing etc. In this paper, we develop a coordination mechanism (nRCM) that simultaneously possesses a few important properties-leading to formation of only grand coalition, inducing complete residual sharing, and ensuring each retailer obtains a higher profit as the system size increases. We also consider the impact of asymmetric demand distribution parameter information on the coordination mechanisms when the retailers privately hold such information. We show that although true coordination requires complete information sharing, under any n-retailer inventory sharing coordination mechanism, retailers may not have incentives to share information with all other retailers and will not share true information even if they do so. In this regard, nRCM possesses another important property: it can be implemented under asymmetric information and retailers can obtain profits very close to their first-best profits even if they do not share demand information. Such nice properties of nRCM also hold when retailers have correlated demands. This paper is the first to study coordination mechanism for an n-retailer (n > 2) inventory sharing system considering asymmetric information. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ID STOCHASTIC VOLATILITY; DIFFUSION
AB In this paper, we propose a new random volatility model, where the volatility has a deterministic term structure modified by a scalar random variable. Closed-form approximation is derived for European option price using higher order Greeks with respect to volatility. We show that the calibration of our model is often more than two orders of magnitude faster than the calibration of commonly used stochastic volatility models, such as the Heston model or Bates model. On 15 different index option data sets, we show that our model achieves accuracy comparable with the aforementioned models, at a much lower computational cost for calibration. Further, our model yields prices for certain exotic options in the same range as these two models. Lastly, the model yields delta and gamma values for options in the same range as the other commonly used models, over most of the data sets considered. Our model has a significant potential for use in high frequency derivative trading. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

DE Queueing; Customer blocking; Level crossing analysis; M/G/1 queue with
   accumulating priority
ID SYSTEM
AB We consider a single-server queueing system with Poisson arrivals and generally distributed service times. To systematically control the workload of the queue, we define for each busy period an associated timer process, {R(t), t >= 0}, where R(t) represents the time remaining before the system is closed to potential arrivals. The process {R(t), t >= 0} is similar to the well-known workload process, in that it decreases at unit rate and consists of up-jumps at the arrival instants of admitted customers. However, if X represents the service requirement of an admitted customer, then the magnitude of the up-jump for the timer process occurring at the arrival instant of this customer is (1 - q)X for a fixed q is an element of [0, 1]. Consequently, there will be an instant in time within the busy period when the timer process hits level zero, at which point the system immediately closes and will remain closed until the end of the current busy period. We refer to this particular blocking policy as the q-policy. In this paper, we employ a level crossing analysis to derive the Laplace Stieltjes transform (LST) of the steady-state waiting time distribution of serviceable customers. We conclude the paper with a numerical example which shows that controlling arrivals in this fashion can be beneficial. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB There are numerous examples of supply chain disruptions that have occurred which have had devastating impacts not only on a single firm but also on various other firms in the supply network. We utilize a Bayesian Network (BN) approach and develop a model of risk propagation in a supply network. The model takes into account the inter-dependencies among different risks, as well as the idiosyncrasies of a supply chain network structure. Specific risk measures are derived from this model and a simulation study is utilized to illustrate how these measures can be used in a supply chain setting. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB A capital allocation scheme for a company that has a random total profit Y and uses a coherent risk measure rho has been suggested. The scheme returns a unique real number Lambda(rho)*(X, Y), which determines the capital that should be allocated to company's subsidiary with random profit X. The resulting capital allocation is linear and diversifying as defined by Kalkbrener (2005). The problem is reduced to selecting the "center" of a nonempty convex weakly compact subset of a Banach space, and the solution to the latter problem proposed by Lim (1981) has been used. Our scheme can also be applied to selecting the unique Pareto optimal allocation in a wide class of optimal risk sharing problems. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB We study stochastic linear programming games: a class of stochastic cooperative games whose payoffs under any realization of uncertainty are determined by a specially structured linear program. These games can model a variety of settings, including inventory centralization and cooperative network fortification. We focus on the core of these games under an allocation scheme that determines how payoffs are distributed before the uncertainty is realized, and allows for arbitrarily different distributions for each realization of the uncertainty. Assuming that each player's preferences over random payoffs are represented by a concave monetary utility functional, we prove that these games have a nonempty core. Furthermore, by establishing a connection between stochastic linear programming games, linear programming games and linear semi-infinite programming games, we show that an allocation in the core can be computed efficiently under some circumstances.

AB We present a modeling framework for analyzing if the use of interruptible transportation services can improve capacity utilization in a natural gas transportation network. The network consists of two decision makers: the transmission system operator (TSO) and a shipper of natural gas. The TSO is responsible for the routing of gas in the network and allocates capacity to the shipper to ensure that the security of supply in the network is within given bounds. The TSO can offer two different types of transportation services: firm and interruptible. Only firm services have a security of supply measure, while the interruptible services can freely be interrupted whenever the available capacity in the transportation network is not sufficiently large. We apply our modeling framework on a case study with realistic data from the Norwegian Continental Shelf. The results indicate substantial increased throughput and profits with the introduction of interruptible services. (C) 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

ID INTERACTIVE APPROACH; MODEL; UNCERTAINTY
AB In this paper, we address the issue of optimal selection of portfolio of projects using reinvestment strategy within a flexible time horizon. We assume that an investor intends to invest his/her initial capital on the implementation of some projects in a flexible time horizon. The investor's motivation for considering a flexible time horizon is to maximize his/her gain by determining the optimal time horizon for investing on the selected portfolio of projects. Projects have different durations and their potential rates of return are also different. The profit yielded by the completed projects can be reinvested in the implementation of other projects. The implementation costs of projects can be allocated at equally spaced intervals with equal amounts during their life cycles or can be assigned to each project according to its estimated s-curve. We assume that the profit yielded by each project is accrued after the investment for the project ends. Therefore, in order to maximize gains, the investor needs to optimize three issues: combination of projects, schedule of the selected projects and the time horizon. An integer program is presented and discussed to address the given issues. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ID FRAUD DETECTION; SAMPLE-SIZE; RISK; CHOICE
AB There remains little consensus about how to define and formulate audit quality. It does not have a consistent definition and operationalization across studies and this has troubled theorists for many years. This study contributes to this discussion by introducing a probability tree model of audit quality. This model is built up of characteristics to create an association with the four sets of audit quality indicators; inputs, process, context, and outcomes (Knechel, W. R, Krishnan, G. V., Pevzner, M., Shefchik, L. B., & Velury, U. (2012). Audit quality: Insights from the academic literature. Auditing: A Journal of Practice & Theory 32(1), 385-421). The purpose is to show how these indicators interplay in the context of audit quality. The model describes the audit program of an audit engagement as a random tree model based on a stochastic process. Following Simon's (Simon, H. A. (1956). Rational choice and the structure of the environment. Psychological Review 63(2), 129138; Simon, H. A. (1957). Models of man. Social and rational. New York: John Wiley & Sons) description of adaptive behavior the model describes an audit program as an organic procedure where an auditor does not maximize but is seeking for material misstatements (inadvertent errors) in a random environment. If the auditor under a budget constraint does not (in spite of positive inherent risk) detect any misstatement, the audit program will erroneously end with an unqualified report (false negative outcome). In this context, we measure subjective audit quality as the probability of the complement of this event (probability of detecting one or more misstatements). We also introduce a concept of perfect auditor with optimal characteristics. Finally, we measure objective audit quality as the relation of the complement event probabilities between the auditor and the perfect auditor. The analytical results are demonstrated by numerical examples. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

We show that, under usual assumptions, if the generic derivative of the utility function of order n is sign invariant then all the derivatives from order n to order 2 alternate in sign. We then focus on the case where the derivative of the utility function of order n is either positive when n is odd or negative when n is even, and we show the implications of this result for high-order risk changes and for saving decisions.

AB The Mixed Capacitated General Routing Problem (MCGRP) is defined over a mixed graph, for which some vertices must be visited and some links must be traversed at least once. The problem consists of determining a set of least-cost vehicle routes that satisfy this requirement and respect the vehicle capacity. Few papers have been devoted to the MCGRP, in spite of interesting real-world applications, prevalent in school bus routing, mail delivery, and waste collection. This paper presents a new mathematical model for the MCGRP based on two-index variables. The approach proposed for the solution is a two-phase branch-and-cut algorithm, which uses an aggregate formulation to develop an effective lower bounding procedure. This procedure also provides strong valid inequalities for the two-index model. Extensive computational experiments over benchmark instances are presented. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The crude oil tanker routing and scheduling problem with split pickup and split delivery is a maritime transportation task where an industrial operator needs to ship different types of crude oil from production sites to oil refineries. The different crude oils are supplied and demanded in many ports in certain time windows. Pickup and delivery quantities are known in advance but no pairing of pickup and delivery needs to be predefined and can be decided together with shipment quantities during optimization. Pickup and delivery quantities may be split arbitrarily among the ships in the fleet. We compare two alternative path flow model approaches to investigate their degree of applicability in a column generation setup. For this purpose we apply route pregeneration prior to optimization. The first approach uses continuous decision variables for pickup and delivery to decide on shipment quantities. In the considerably shorter second formulation cargo quantities are discretized and included into the paths. The second approach is capable to solve larger instances and is more efficient in terms of computational performance, however solution quality may decrease due to the discretization.

AB The capacity of a runway system represents a bottleneck at many international airports. The current practice at airports is to land approaching aircraft on a first-come, first-served basis. An active rescheduling of aircraft landing times increases runway capacity or reduces delays. The problem of finding an optimal schedule for aircraft landings is referred to as the "aircraft landing problem". The objective is to minimize the total delay of aircraft landings or the respective cost. The necessary separation time between two operations must be met. Due to the complexity of this scheduling problem, recent research has been focused on developing heuristic solution approaches. This article presents a new algorithm that is able to create optimal landing schedules on multiple independent runways for aircraft with positive target landing times and limited time windows. Our numerical experiments show that problems with up to 100 aircraft can be optimally solved within seconds. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In this paper, we extend the vehicle routing problem with clustered backhauls (VRPCB) to an integrated routing and three-dimensional loading problem, called VRPCB with 3D loading constraints (3L-VRPCB). In the VRPCB each customer is either a linehaul or a backhaul customer and in each route all linehaul customers must be visited before any backhaul customer. In the 3L-VRPCB, each customer demand is given as a set of 3D rectangular items (boxes) and the vehicle capacity is replaced by a 3D loading space. Moreover, some packing constraints, e.g. concerning stacking of boxes, are also integrated. A set of routes of minimum total length has to be determined such that each customer is visited once. For each route two packing plans have to be provided that stow all boxes of all visited linehaul and backhaul customers, respectively, taking into account the additional packing constraints. We propose two hybrid algorithms for solving the 3L-VRPCB, each of them consisting of a routing and a packing procedure. The routing procedures follow different metaheuristic strategies (large vs. variable neighborhood search) and in both algorithms a tree search heuristic is responsible for packing boxes. Extensive computational experiments were carried out using 95 3L-VRPCB benchmark instances that were derived from well-known VRPCB instances. Good results are also achieved for the capacitated vehicle routing problem with 3D loading constraints as a special case of the 3L-VRPCB. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The goal of this paper is to quantify the impact of Inventory Record Inaccuracy on the dynamics of collaborative supply chains, both in terms of operational performance (i.e. order and inventory stability), and customer service level. To do so, we model an Information Exchange Supply Chain under shrinkage errors in the inventory item recording activity of their nodes, present the mathematical formulation of such supply chain model, and conduct a numerical simulation assuming different levels of errors. Results clearly show that Inventory Record Inaccuracy strongly compromises supply chain stability, particularly when moving upwards in the supply chain. Important managerial insights can be extracted from this analysis, such as the role of 'benefit-sharing' strategies in order to guarantee the advantage of investments in connectivity technologies.

AB Condition-based maintenance has been proven effective in reducing unexpected failures with minimum operational costs. This study considers an optimal condition-based replacement policy with optimal inspection interval when the degradation conforms to an inverse Gaussian process with random effects. The random effects parameter is used to account for heterogeneities commonly observed among a product population. Its distribution is updated when more degradation observations are available. The observed degradation level together with the unit's age are used for the replacement decision. The structure of the optimal replacement policy is investigated in depth. We prove that the monotone control limit policy is optimal. We also provide numerical studies to validate our results and conduct sensitivity analysis of the model parameters on the optimal policy.

AB This paper presents a study of the problem of resource allocation between increasing protection of components and constructing redundant components in parallel systems subject to intentional threats. The defender aims at minimizing the entire system destruction probability during certain time horizon by using the best resource allocation strategy which is determined by redundant components construction pace. Different from previous works which focus on the static resource allocation strategy, we propose a dynamic resource distribution strategy with geometric construction pace model and show its advantage over constant construction pace. The vulnerability model considering a most probable attack time and uncertainties of attack time estimates is provided and a destruction probability is evaluated to quantitatively define the ability of the system to survive an intentional attack. The random time of intentional attack is represented by truncated normal distribution. Through the modeling of the most probable attack time and quantifying the uncertainty of the knowledge of defender about this time, the influence of these factors on the optimal resource allocation strategy is investigated. Proper decision regarding the resource allocation is crucial in protecting safety-critical systems, i.e. nuclear power plant, communication base station, power network. Case studies are presented to illustrate the influence and strategy. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The paper provides some guidelines to individuals with defined contribution (DC) pension plans on how to manage pension savings both before and after retirement. We argue that decisions regarding investment, annuity payments, and the size of death sum should not only depend on the individual's age (or time left to retirement), nor should they solely depend on the risk preferences, but should also capture: (1) economical characteristics such as current value on the pension savings account, expected pension contributions (mandatory and voluntary), and expected income after retirement (e.g. retirement state pension), and (2) personal characteristics such as risk aversion, lifetime expectancy, preferable payout profile, bequest motive, and preferences on portfolio composition. Specifically, the decisions are optimal under the expected CRRA utility function and are subject to the constraints characterizing the individual.
   The problem is solved via a model that combines two optimization approaches: stochastic optimal control and multi-stage stochastic programming. The first method is common in financial and actuarial literature, but produces theoretical results. However, the latter, which is characteristic for operations research, has practical applications. We present the operations research methods which have potential to stimulate new thinking and add to actuarial practice. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ID HEALTH-CARE; SCHEDULING PROBLEM; ALGORITHM
AB Landelijke Thuiszorg is a "social profit" organisation that provides home care services in several Belgian regions. In this paper, the core optimisation component of a decision support system to support the planning of the organisations' home care service is described. Underlying this decision support system is an optimisation problem that aims to maximise the service level and to minimise the distance travelled by the caregivers of the organisation. This problem is formulated as a bi-objective mathematical program, based on a set partitioning problem formulation. A flexible two-stage solution strategy is designed to efficiently tackle the problem. Computational tests, as well as extensive pilot runs performed by the organisation's personnel, show that this approach achieves excellent performance, both in terms of the service level and total travelled distance. Moreover, computational times are small, allowing for the weekly planning to be largely automated. The organisation is currently in the process of implementing our solution approach in collaboration with an external software company. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This paper describes a methodology that aims to enhance statistical inference in data envelopment analysis (DEA). In order to incorporate statistical properties in a DEA analysis we propose a combined application of a chance constrained DEA (CCDEA) model that is integrated with a stochastic mechanism from Bayesian techniques. The proposed method is conducted in two basic steps. In a first step we make use of Bayesian techniques on the data set to generate a statistical model and to simulate a large number of alternative data sets that can be observed as realizations. In a second step we solve the CCDEA problem for each and every one of the alternative samples, compute efficiency measures, and use the sampling distribution of these measures as an approximation to the finite sample distribution. The paper discusses the statistical advantages of this method using cross-sectional data from a sample of 117 Greek public hospitals. In testing the model we use homogeneous groups of hospitals in various sizes according to the hierarchical structure of the Greek health system (primary, secondary and tertiary care). In order to measure the overall technical efficiency of hospitals that are classified into different groups we introduce the concept of metafrontier analysis on the developed model. The results show that the tertiary and secondary hospitals operate with similar production technologies while a large technology gap is observed between the primary care hospitals and the metafrontier.

AB This paper uses the setting of a volleyball game and an exotic sports betting on the point difference of volleyball games to test whether people correctly understand the probabilities related to outcomes of a process which follows a binomial distribution. We find that people consistently underestimate the probabilities of outcomes that correspond to extreme ends of the distribution. This is consistent with the extremeness aversion bias documented in decision making studies. Whereas previous studies on the extremeness aversion bias find the existence of the bias in a consumer choice setting, we document that this bias also exists in an investment setting. We find evidence of learning behavior over time; however, it is not sufficient to eliminate the bias. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This paper presents a review and classification of the literature regarding workforce planning problems incorporating skills. In many cases, technical research regarding workforce planning focuses very hard on the mathematical model and neglects the real life implications of the simplifications that were needed for the model to perform well. On the other hand, many managerial studies give an extensive description of the human implications of certain management decisions in particular cases, but fail to provide useful mathematical models to solve workforce planning problems. This review will guide the operations researcher in his search to find useful papers and information regarding workforce planning problems incorporating skills. We not only discuss the differences and similarities between different papers, but we also give an overview of the managerial insights. The objective is to present a combination of technical and managerial knowledge to encourage the production of more realistic and useful solution techniques. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB We consider the online Steiner Traveling Salesman Problem. In this problem, we are given an edge-weighted graph G = (V, E) and a subset D subset of V of destination vertices, with the optimization goal to find a minimum weight closed tour that traverses every destination vertex of D at least once. During the traversal, the salesman could encounter at most k non-recoverable blocked edges. The edge blockages are real-time, meaning that the salesman knows about a blocked edge whenever it occurs. We first show a lower bound on the competitive ratio and present an online optimal algorithm for the problem. While this optimal algorithm has non-polynomial running time, we present another online polynomial-time near optimal algorithm for the problem. Experimental results show that our online polynomial-time algorithm produces solutions very close to the offline optimal solutions. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB We propose a large neighborhood search (LNS) algorithm to solve the periodic location routing problem (PLRP). The PLRP combines location and routing decisions over a planning horizon in which customers require visits according to a given frequency and the specific visit days can be chosen.

The computational results show that the algorithms obtain better results than previous solution methods on a set of standard benchmark instances from the literature. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB We first consider the ordinary NP-hard three-machine proportionate open shop minimum makespan 03 vertical bar ptpt vertical bar C-max problem and show that it is solvable in O(n log n) time when certain conditions on the total machine load are met. When these conditions are not met, we derive an approximate solution by implementing the optimal solution for the 03 vertical bar ptpt vertical bar C-max problem when the two longest jobs are of equal length. In that case, both absolute and ratio worst-case bounds are derived. We also consider the more general mixed shop problem 03 vertical bar ptpt vertical bar C-max in which a given job subset must be processed as in a flow shop while the remaining jobs can be processed as in the 03 vertical bar ptpt vertical bar C-max problem. We show that our open shop solution techniques can be implemented to derive exact and approximate solutions for the 03 vertical bar ptpt vertical bar C-max problem. Finally, we discuss the applicability of our open shop results to the proportionate open shop problem with unequal machine speeds. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB We consider a scheduling problem where jobs consume a perishable resource stored in vials. It leads to a new scheduling problem, with two-dimensional jobs, one dimension for the duration and one dimension for the consumption. Jobs have to be finished before a given due date, and the objective is to schedule the jobs on a single machine so that the maximum lateness does not exceed a given threshold and the number of vials required for processing all the jobs is minimized. We propose a two-step approach embedding a Recovering Beam Search algorithm to get a good-quality initial solution reachable in short time and a more time consuming matheuristic algorithm. Computational experiments are performed on the benchmark instances available for the two-dimensional vector packing problem integrated with additional due dates to take into account the maximum lateness constraints. The computational results show very good performances of the proposed approach that remains effective also on the original two-dimensional vector packing instances without due dates where 7 new bounds are obtained.

AB One of the greatest challenges in managing product development projects is identifying an appropriate sequence of many coupled activities. The current study presents an effective approach for determining the activity sequence with minimum total feedback time in a design structure matrix (DSM). First, a new formulation of the optimization problem is proposed, which allows us to obtain optimal solutions in a reasonable amount of time for problems up to 40 coupled activities. Second, two simple rules are proposed, which can be conveniently used by management to reduce the total feedback time. We also prove that if the sequence of activities in a subproblem is altered, then the change of total feedback time in the overall problem equals to the change in the subproblem. Because the optimization problem is NP-complete, we further develop a heuristic approach that is able to provide good solutions for large instances. To illustrate its application, we apply the presented approach to the design of balancing machines in an international firm. Finally, we perform a large number of random experiments to demonstrate that the presented approach outperforms existing state-of-art heuristics. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The concept of delayed product differentiation has received considerable attention in the research literature in recent years. However, few analytical models explain and quantify the benefits of delayed product differentiation strategy with additional consideration of supplier delivery performance. This paper proposes a delayed product differentiation model in which a supply of raw materials is integrated at the beginning of the production process to match uncertain demand in a cost-effective way given the constraint of lead time delivery window. It develops insights regarding a delayed product differentiation strategy and shows that with respect to delivery windows, supplier delivery performance plays an important role in the determination of the optimal point of differentiation. This study also shows that when the "on-time" and the "late" portions of the delivery window are constant, the proposed cost function coincides with similar models found in the literature. An extension of this work also reveals that when the customer service level varies across various production stages, its choice affects the decision to delay or postpone the customization point. A mini industrial case involving the customization of a personal desktop computer is used to illustrate the applicability of the resulting framework. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB We study a multiple period discount problem for products that undergo several price cuts over time. In the high-technology sector, electronic component suppliers are often able to offer pre-announced price cuts to buyers due to technological innovation that allows them to produce existing components at lower costs. In this context, suppliers are primarily concerned with the optimal pricing decisions for the components over their life spans in order to achieve the highest possible revenues. Accordingly, the buying firms (i.e., manufacturers or retailers) also need to identify the corresponding optimal retail prices and order quantity for the finished products that utilize the components for which discounts are offered frequently. In this research, we develop a multiple-period price discount model that addresses this issue. Extant research in the price discount literature focuses on supply chains' pricing and inventory decisions in the presence of a single price discount. The proposed model, in contrast, offers a systematic decision tool for identifying the optimal strategies throughout a product's life span. Our results show that a decentralized supply chain characterized by multi-period discounts over a product's life typically achieves 75 percent supply chain efficiency. We undertake a series of numerical experiments based on the model and discuss their managerial implications. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB We study the Cournot competition between two supply chains that are subject to supply uncertainty. Each supply chain consists of a retailer and an exclusive supplier which has random yield. We examine how the levels of supply uncertainty and competition intensity affect the equilibrium decisions of ordering quantity, contract offering, and centralization choice. We show that a retailer should order more if its competing retailer's supply becomes less reliable or if its own supply becomes more reliable. A supply chain with reliable supply can take great advantage of the high supply risk of its competing chain. Furthermore, for decentralized chains we characterize the optimal wholesale price contracts with linear penalty, under different supply risks and competition scenarios. Finally, we show that supply chain centralization is a dominant strategy, and it always makes the customers better off. Nevertheless, if the supply risk is low and the chain competition is intensive, centralization could actually decrease the supply chain profit, compared with the case where both chains do not choose centralization. This results in a prisoner's dilemma. On the other hand, if the supply risk is high and/or the competition level is low, centralization always increases the supply chain profit The desirability of supply chain centralization is enhanced by high supply uncertainty or low chain competition.

AB For evolving populations the training data and the test data need not follow the same distribution. Thus, the performance of a prediction model will deteriorate over the course of time. This requires the re-estimation of the prediction model after some time. However, in many applications e.g. credit scoring, new labelled data are not available for re-estimation due to verification latency, i.e. label delay. Thus, methods which enable a prediction model to adapt to distributional changes by using only unlabelled data are highly desirable.
   A shift adaptation method for binary classification is presented here. The model is based on mixture distributions. The conditional feature distributions are determined at the time where labelled data are available, and the unconditional feature distribution is determined at the time where new unlabelled data are accessible. These mixture distributions provide information on the old and the new positions of subpopulations. A transition model then describes how the subpopulations of each class have drifted to form the new unconditional feature distribution. Assuming that the conditional distributions are reorganised using a minimum of energy, a two-step estimation procedure results. First, for a given class prior distribution the transfer of probability mass is estimated such that the energy required to obtain the new unconditional distribution by a local transfer of the old conditional distributions is a minimum. Since the optimal solution of the resulting transportation problem measures the distance between the old and the new distributions, the change of the class prior distribution is found in a second step by solving the transportation problem for varying class prior distributions and selecting the value for which the objective function is a minimum. Using the solution of the transportation problem and the component parameters of the unconditional feature distribution, the new conditional feature distribution can be determined. This thus allows for a shift adaptation of the classification rule.
   The performance of the proposed model is investigated using a large real-world dataset on default rates in Danish companies. The results show that the shift adaptation improves classification results. (C) 2014 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB We consider the problem of pricing and alliance selection that a dominant retailer in a two-echelon supply chain decides when facing a potential upstream entry. The two-echelon supply chain consists of a dominant retailer, an incumbent supplier and an "incursive" vendor, where both the incumbent supplier and "incursive" vendor sell substitutable products to the common market through the dominant retailer. Our objective is to discuss whether the dominant retailer should sell the "incursive" vendor's products and, if so, how the dominant retailer strategically selects the alliance structure to maximize his/her own profit. We also present how all the members make their pricing decisions and analyze the impact of competitive intensity between two products on their pricing strategies after the entry of the vendor in possible alliance settings. Our results show that: (1) the introduction of the upstream vendor always benefits the retailer, and more interestingly, benefits the incumbent suppler in many cases, too; (2) in this paper, we define the competitive ability as the price dominance of one player over another when both are competing for the same customer market, if the price competition between the incumbent supplier and the "incursive" vendor is relatively fierce, the dominant retailer should ally with the one who has a relatively strong competitive ability rather than the other who has a relatively weak competitive ability; otherwise, he/she should ally with both upstream members. Finally, using numerical examples, we analyze the impact of different parameters and provide some management insights. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB We deal with the multi-attribute decision problem with sequentially presented decision alternatives. Our decision model is based on the assumption that the decision-maker has a major attribute that must be "optimized" and minor attributes that must be "satisficed". In the vendor selection problem, for example, the product price could be the major factor that should be optimized, while the product quality and delivery time could be the minor factors that should satisfy certain aspiration levels. We first derive the optimal selection strategy for the discrete-time case in which one alternative is presented at each time period. The discrete-time model is then extended to the continuous-time case in which alternatives are presented sequentially at random times. A numerical example is used to analyze the effects of the satisficing condition and the uncertainty on the optimal selection strategy. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ID NETWORKS
AB In this paper we deal with TU games in which cooperation is restricted by means of a weighted network. We admit several interpretations for the weight of a link: capacity of the communication channel, flow across it, intimacy or intensity in the relation, distance between both incident nodes/players, cost of building or maintaining the communication link or even probability of the relation (as in Calvo, Lasaga, and van den Noweland, 1999). Then, according to the different interpretations, we introduce several point solutions for these restricted games in a way parallel to the familiar environment of Myerson. Finally, we characterize these values in terms of the (adapted) component efficiency, fairness and balanced contributions properties and we analyze the extent to which they satisfy a link/weight monotonicity property.

AB This paper develops a new class of aggregation operator based on utility function, which introduces the risk attitude of decision makers (DMs) in the aggregation process. First, under the general framework of utility function, we provide a new operator called the generalized ordered weighted utility averaging (GOWUA) operator, and study its properties which are suitable for any utility function. Then, under the hyperbolic absolute risk aversion (HARA) utility function, we propose another new operator named as the generalized ordered weighted utility averaging-hyperbolic absolute risk aversion (GOWUA-HARA) operator, and further investigate its families including a wide range of aggregation operators. To determine the GOWUA-HARA operator weights, we put forward an orness measure of the GOWUA-HARA operator and analyze its properties. Considering that different DMs may have different opinions toward decision-making and their opinions can be characterized by different mess measures, we construct a new optimization model to determine the optimal weights which can aggregate all the individual sets of weights into an overall set of weights. Furthermore, based on the GOWUA-HARA operator, a method for the multiple attribute group decision-making (MAGDM) is developed. Finally, an example is given to illustrate the application of the GOWUA-HARA operator to the MAGDM. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The increase in cost of supplies and services is outpacing the increase in revenues at many hospitals. To address this cost increase hospitals are seeking more efficient ways to store and manage vast inventories of medical supplies. A parsimonious and efficient inventory system which we call 2Bin is becoming increasingly popular in North American hospitals. Under the 2Bin system inventory is stored in two equal-sized bins. 2Bin systems are reviewed periodically and empty bins are replenished. In recent years the adoption of RFID technology for 2Bin systems is allowing continuous-time tracking of empty bins, increasing inventory visibility. In this paper we model the 2Bin inventory system under periodic and continuous review. For periodic review we show that the long-run average cost per unit time is quasi-convex, enabling a simple search for the optimal review cycle. For continuous review, we present a semi-Markov decision model, characterize the optimal replenishment policy, and provide a solution approach to obtain the long-run average cost per unit time. Using data obtained from hospitals currently using RFID-enabled 2Bin systems, we estimate the economic benefits of using the best periodic review length (i.e., parameter optimization), and of using a continuous review inventory policy (i.e., policy improvement). We characterize system conditions such as the number of medical supplies used, replenishment costs, stock-out costs, etc. that favor each option, and provide insights to hospital management on system design considerations that favor the use of periodic or continuous review.

AB Non-profit organizations like the Meals On Wheels (MOW) association of America prepare and deliver meals, typically daily, to approximately one million homebound individuals in the United States alone. However, many MOW agencies are facing a steadily increasing number of clients requesting meal service without an increase in resources (either financial or human). One strategy for accommodating these requests is to deliver multiple (frozen) meals at a time and thus make fewer deliveries. However, many of the stakeholders (funders, volunteers, meal recipients) value the relationships that are developed by having a client receive daily deliveries from the same volunteer. Further, meal recipients may be concerned with the quality of food delivered in a frozen meal. In this paper, we develop a method for introducing consolidation into home meal delivery while minimizing operational disruptions and maintaining client satisfaction. With an extensive computational study, the savings associated with various levels and types of disruptions are detailed. The question of whether delivering frozen meals will enable an agency to both save money and deliver meals to a larger client base is also studied. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Every year, natural and man-made disasters affect hundreds of thousands of people and cause extensive damage. OR has made substantial contributions to disaster response and these have been the subject of several recent literature reviews. However, these reviews have also identified research gaps for OR - two of which are (1) limited contribution from soft OR, and (2) a need to model communications during disasters where there are complex interactions between stakeholders. At the intersection of these gaps we apply the Viable System Model (VSM) to examine challenges of rapid communication viability during dynamic disasters. The data that informs this paper were collected in four case studies in Japan - three on its current capabilities (e.g. a local government disaster management office) and one on its response to a past disaster (the Great Hanshin-Awaji Earthquake in 1995). This paper shows how applying VSM identified generic gaps and opportunities for communication systems and shows how these case studies signal the utility of VSM structures to arranging communications for fast-paced and changing environments. This paper also contributes to VSM theory through developing two new concepts (1) environmental support mechanisms for viability; and (2) rapid implementation unit emergence. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB The maximum clique problem (MCP) is to determine in a graph a clique (i.e., a complete subgraph) of maximum cardinality. The MCP is notable for its capability of modeling other combinatorial problems and real-world applications. As one of the most studied NP-hard problems, many algorithms are available in the literature and new methods are continually being proposed. Given that the two existing surveys on the MCP date back to 1994 and 1999 respectively, one primary goal of this paper is to provide an updated and comprehensive review on both exact and heuristic MCP algorithms, with a special focus on recent developments. To be informative, we identify the general framework followed by these algorithms and pinpoint the key ingredients that make them successful. By classifying the main search strategies and putting forward the critical elements of the most relevant clique methods, this review intends to encourage future development of more powerful methods and motivate new applications of the clique approaches.

AB We propose a generalization of the multi-depot capacitated vehicle routing problem where the assumption of visiting each customer does not hold. In this problem, called the Multi-Depot Covering Tour Vehicle Routing Problem (MDCTVRP), the demand of each customer could be satisfied in two different ways: either by visiting the customer along the tour or by "covering" it. When a customer is visited, the corresponding demand is delivered at its location. A customer is instead covered when it is located within an acceptable distance from at least one visited customer from which it can receive its demand. For this problem we develop two mixed integer programming formulations and a hybrid metaheuristic combining GRASP, iterated local search and simulated annealing. Extensive computational tests on this problem and some of its variants clearly indicate the effectiveness of the developed solution methods. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Reverse factoring a financial arrangement where a corporation facilitates early payment of its trade credit obligations to suppliers is increasingly popular in industry. Many firms use the scheme to induce their suppliers to grant them more lenient payment terms. By means of a periodic review base stock model that includes alternative sources of financing, we explore the following question: what extensions of payment terms allow the supplier to benefit from reverse factoring? We obtain solutions by means of simulation optimisation. We find that an extension of payment terms induces a non-linear financing cost for the supplier, beyond the opportunity cost of carrying additional receivables. Furthermore, we find that the size of the payment term extension that a supplier can accommodate depends on demand uncertainty and the cost structure of the supplier. Overall, our results show that the financial implications of an extension of payment terms need careful assessment in stochastic settings. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The buffer allocation problem consists of a dynamical description of the underlying production process combined with stochastic processing times. The aim is to find optimal buffer sizes averaged over several samples. Starting from a time-discrete recursion we derive a time-continuous model supplemented with a stochastic process. The new model is used for simulation and optimization purposes as well. Numerical experiments show the efficiency of our approach compared to other optimization techniques. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB In this paper, we consider a multi-period fuzzy portfolio optimization problem with minimum transaction lots. Based on possibility theory, we formulate a mean-semivariance portfolio selection model with the objectives of maximizing the terminal wealth and minimizing the cumulative risk over the whole investment horizon. In the proposed model, we take the return, risk, transaction costs, diversification degree, cardinality constraint and minimum transaction lots into consideration. To reflect investor's aspiration levels for the two objectives, a fuzzy decision technique is employed to transform the proposed model into a single objective mixed-integer nonlinear programming problem. Then, we design a genetic algorithm for solution. Finally, we give an empirical application in Chinese stock markets to demonstrate the idea of our model and the effectiveness of the designed algorithm. (C) 2014 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB We address a generalization of the asymmetric Traveling Salesman Problem where routes have to be constructed to satisfy customer requests, which either involve the pickup or delivery of a single commodity. A vehicle is to be routed such that the demand and the supply of the customers is satisfied under the objective to minimize the total distance traveled. The commodities which are collected from the pickup customers can be used to accommodate the demand of the delivery customers. In this paper, we present three mathematical formulations for this problem class and apply branch-and-cut algorithms to optimally solve the model formulations. For two of the models we derive Benders cuts based on the classical and the generalized Benders decomposition. Finally, we analyze the different mathematical formulations and associated solution approaches on well-known data sets from the literature. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Direct current (DC) electricity distribution systems have been proposed as an alternative to traditional, alternating current (AC) distribution systems for commercial buildings. Partial replacement of AC distribution with DC distribution can improve service to DC loads and overall building energy efficiency. This article develops (i) a mixed-integer, nonlinear, nonconvex mathematical programming problem to determine maximally energy efficient designs for mixed AC-DC electricity distribution systems in commercial buildings, and (ii) describes a tailored global optimization algorithm based on Nonconvex Generalized Benders Decomposition. The results of three case studies demonstrate the strength of the decomposition approach compared to state-of-the-art general-purpose global solvers. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

First, we derive a formula for the radius of robust feasibility guaranteeing constraint feasibility for all possible scenarios within a specified uncertainty set under affine data parametrization. We then present numerically tractable optimality conditions for minmax robust weakly efficient solutions, i.e., the weakly efficient solutions of the robust counterpart. We also consider highly robust weakly efficient solutions, i.e., robust feasible solutions which are weakly efficient for any possible instance of the objective matrix within a specified uncertainty set, providing lower bounds for the radius of highly robust efficiency guaranteeing the existence of this type of solutions under affine and rank-1 objective data uncertainty. Finally, we provide numerically tractable optimality conditions for highly robust weakly efficient solutions. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Many practical optimization problems are dynamically changing, and require a tracking of the global optimum over time. However, tracking usually has to be quick, which excludes re-optimization from scratch every time the problem changes. Instead, it is important to make good use of the history of the search even after the environment has changed. In this paper, we consider Efficient Global Optimization (EGO), a global search algorithm that is known to work well for expensive black box optimization problems where only few function evaluations are possible. It uses metamodels of the objective function for deciding where to sample next. We propose and compare four methods of incorporating old and recent information in the metamodels of EGO in order to accelerate the search for the global optima of a noise-free objective function stochastically changing over time. As we demonstrate, exploiting old information as much as possible significantly improves the tracking behavior of the algorithm. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In this work we propose the first integer linear programming model for solving this problem. Moreover, on the basis of the integer linear programming model we develop a deterministic 2-phase heuristic which is applicable to larger problem instances. The results show that provenly optimal solutions can be obtained for problem instances of small and medium size from the literature by solving the proposed integer linear programming model with CPLEX. Furthermore, new best-known solutions are obtained for all considered problem instances from the literature. Concerning the heuristic, we were able to show that it outperforms heuristic competitors from the related literature. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This paper studies the joint optimization problem of energy and delay in a multi-hop wireless network. The optimization variables are the transmission rates, which are adjustable according to the packet queueing length in the buffer. The optimization goal is to minimize the energy consumption of energy-critical nodes and the packet transmission delay throughout the network. In this paper, we aim at understanding the well-known decentralized algorithms which are threshold based from a different research angle. By using a simplified network model, we show that we can adopt the semi-open Jackson network model and study this optimization problem in closed form. This simplified network model further allows us to establish some significant optimality properties. We prove that the system performance is monotonic with respect to (w.r.t.) the transmission rate. We also prove that the threshold-type policy is optimal, i.e., when the number of packets in the buffer is larger than a threshold, transmit with the maximal rate (power); otherwise, no transmission. With these optimality properties, we develop a heuristic algorithm to iteratively find the optimal threshold. Filially, we conduct some simulation experiments to demonstrate the main idea of this paper. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The Biobjective Shortest Path Problem (BSP) is the problem of finding (one-to-one) paths from a start node to an end node, while simultaneously minimizing two (conflicting) objective functions. We present an exact recursive method based on implicit enumeration that aggressively prunes dominated solutions. Our approach compares favorably against a top-performer algorithm on two large testbeds from the literature and efficiently solves the BSP on large-scale networks with up to 1.2 million nodes and 2.8 million arcs. Additionally, we describe how the algorithm can be extended to handle more than two objectives and prove the concept on networks with up to 10 objectives. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This paper presents a state transition based formal framework for a new search method, called Evolutionary Ruin and Stochastic Recreate, which tries to learn and adapt to the changing environments during the search process. It improves the performance of the original Ruin and Recreate principle by embedding an additional phase of Evolutionary Ruin to mimic the survival-of-the-fittest mechanism within single solutions. This method executes a cycle of Solution Decomposition, Evolutionary Ruin, Stochastic Recreate and Solution Acceptance until a certain stopping condition is met. The Solution Decomposition phase first uses some problem-specific knowledge to decompose a complete solution into its components and assigns a score to each component. The Evolutionary Ruin phase then employs two evolutionary operators (namely Selection and Mutation) to destroy a certain fraction of the solution, and the next Stochastic Recreate phase repairs the "broken" solution. Last, the Solution Acceptance phase selects a specific strategy to determine the probability of accepting the newly generated solution. Hence, optimisation is achieved by an iterative process of component evaluation, solution disruption and stochastic constructive repair. From the state transitions point of view, this paper presents a probabilistic model and implements a Markov chain analysis on some theoretical properties of the approach. Unlike the theoretical work on genetic algorithm and simulated annealing which are based on state transitions within the space of complete assignments, our model is based on state transitions within the space of partial assignments. The exam timetabling problems are used to test the performance in solving real-world hard problems. (C) 2014 Published by Elsevier B.V.

TI Periodic review and continuous ordering
SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF OPERATIONAL RESEARCH

DT Review
DE Inventory; Periodic review; Continuous ordering; Newsvendor solution
AB Many inventory control studies consider either continuous review and continuous ordering, or periodic review and periodic ordering. Mixtures of the two are hardly ever studied. However, the model with periodic review and continuous ordering is highly relevant in practice, as information on the actual inventory level is not always up to date while making ordering decisions. This paper will therefore treat this model. Assuming zero fixed ordering costs, and allowing for a non-negative lead time and a general demand process, we first consider a one-period decision problem without salvage cost for inventory remaining at the end of the period. In this setting we derive a base-line optimal order path, described by a simple newsvendor solution with safety stocks increasing towards the end of a review period. We then show that for the general, multi-period problem, the optimal policy in a period is to first arrive at this path by not ordering until the excess buffer stock from the previous review period is depleted, then follow the path by continuous ordering, and stop ordering towards the end to limit excess stocks for the next review period. An important managerial insight is that, typically, no order should be placed at a review moment, although this may seem intuitive and is also the standard assumption in periodic review models. We illustrate that adhering to the optimal ordering path instead can lead to cost reductions of 30-60 percent compared to pure periodic ordering. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In this paper, we consider an assemble-to-order manufacturing system producing a single end product, assembled from n components, and serving an after sales market for individual components. Components are produced in a make-to-stock fashion, one unit at a time, on independent production facilities. Production times are exponentially distributed with finite production rates. The components are stocked ahead of demand and therefore incur a holding cost rate per unit. Demand for the end product as well as for the individual components occurs continuously over time according to independent Poisson streams. In order to characterize the optimal production and inventory rationing policies, we formulate such a problem using a Markov decision process framework. In particular, we show that the optimal component production policy is a state-dependent base-stock policy. We also show that the optimal component inventory rationing policy is a rationing policy with state-dependent rationing levels. Recognizing that such a policy is generally not only difficult to obtain numerically but also is difficult to implement in practice, we propose three heuristic policies that are easier to implement in practice. We show that two of these heuristics are highly efficient compared to the optimal policy. In particular, we show that one of the two heuristics strikes a balance between high efficiency and computational effort and thus can be used as an effective substitute of the optimal policy.

AB The distribution of products using compartmentalized vehicles involves many decisions such as the allocation of products to vehicle compartments, vehicle routing and inventory control. These decisions often span several periods, yielding a difficult optimization problem. In this paper we define and compare four main categories of the Multi-Compartment Delivery Problem (MCDP). We propose two mixed-integer linear programming formulations for each case, as well as specialized models for particular versions of the problem. Known and new valid inequalities are introduced in all models. We then describe a branch-and-cut algorithm applicable to all variants of the MCDP. We have performed extensive computational experiments on single-period and multi-period cases of the problem. The largest instances that could be solved exactly for these two cases contain 50 and 20 customers, respectively. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB We contribute to the literature by developing a normative theory of the relationship between stock and mutual insurers based on a contingent claims framework. To consistently price policies provided by firms in these two legal forms of organization, we extend the work of Doherty and Garven (1986) to the mutual case, thus ensuring that the formulae for the stock insurer are nested in our more general model. This set-up allows us to separately consider the ownership and policyholder stakes included in the mutual insurance premium and explicitly takes into account the right to charge additional premiums in times of financial distress, restrictions on the ability of members to realize the value of their equity stake, as well as relevant market frictions. A numerical implementation of our model shows that, for the premiums of stock and mutual insurers to be equal, the latter would need to hold comparatively less equity capital. We then evaluate panel data for the German motor liability insurance sector and demonstrate that observed premiums are not consistent with our normative findings. The combination of theory and empirical evidence suggests that policies offered by stock insurers are overpriced relative to policies of mutuals. Consequently, we suspect considerable wealth transfers between the stakeholder groups. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This article presents a goal programming framework to solve group decision making problems where decision-makers' judgments are provided as incomplete interval additive reciprocal comparison matrices (IARCMs). New properties of multiplicative consistent IARCMs are put forward and used to define consistent incomplete IARCMs. A two-step goal programming method is developed to estimate missing values for an incomplete IARCM. The first step minimizes the inconsistency of the completed IARCMs and controls uncertainty ratios of the estimated judgments within an acceptable threshold, and the second step finds the most appropriate estimated missing values among the optimal solutions obtained from the previous step. A weighted geometric mean approach is proposed to aggregate individual IARCMs into a group IARCM by employing the lower bounds of the interval additive reciprocal judgments. A two-step procedure consisting of two goal programming models is established to derive interval weights from the group IARCM. The first model is devised to minimize the absolute difference between the logarithm of the group preference and that of the constructed multiplicative consistent judgment. The second model is developed to generate an interval-valued priority vector by maximizing the uncertainty ratio of the constructed consistent IARCM and incorporating the optimal objective value of the first model as a constraint. Two numerical examples are furnished to demonstrate validity and applicability of the proposed approach. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In many supply chains, the manufacturer sells not only through an independent retailer, but also through its own direct channel. This work studies the pricing and assortment decisions in such a supply chain in the presence of inventory costs. In our model, the retailer offers a subset of the assortment that the manufacturer offers through its direct channel. We model the customer demand by building on the nested-logit model, which captures the customer's choice between the manufacturer and the retailer. This model produces several insights into the optimal pricing strategies of the manufacturer. For example, we find that variants with high demand variability will carry a lower wholesale price. Furthermore, we characterize scenarios in which the manufacturer's and retailer's assortment preferences are in conflict. In particular, the manufacturer may prefer the retailer to carry items with high demand variability while the retailer prefers items with low demand variability. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB Technology based loan default is related not only to technology-oriented attributes (management, technology, profitability and marketability), and firm-specific characteristics but also to the economic situation after the loan. However, the default phenomenon for technology based loan has not reflected the change of economic situation. We propose a framework of utilizing a time varying Cox hazard proportional model in the context of technology based credit scoring. The proposed model is used for stress test with various scenarios of lending portfolio and economic situations. The results indicate that the firms with higher management score than average have the lower loan default rates than the firms with higher profitability or marketability score than average due to the effect of manager's knowledge and experience and fund supply ability when they are exposed under the same economic condition. In scenario test, we found the highest default rate under stable exchange rate with high consumer price index. Moreover, firms with a high level of marketability factors turn out to be significantly affected by economic conditions in terms of technology credit risk. We expect the result of this study can provide valuable feedback for the management of technology credit fund for SMEs. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In this paper we analyze the applicability of the TOPSIS method to support the process of building the scoring system for negotiation offers in ill-structured negotiations. When discussing the ill-structured negotiation problem we consider two major issues: the imprecisely defined negotiation space, and the vagueness of the negotiator's preferences that cannot be defined by means of crisp values. First we introduce the traditional fuzzy TOPSIS model showing the alternative ways of normalizing the data and measuring the distances, which allows to avoid the problem of ranking reversals. Then we formalize ill-structured negotiations using a model which allows the negotiation problem to be defined in a simplified way by means of the aspiration and reservation levels only. Such a definition requires changes in the traditional fuzzy TOPSIS algorithm the development of a mechanism for scoring the offers that fall outside of the negotiation space defined independently and subjectively by the negotiator. We propose three different approaches to handle this problem, that keep the scoring system stable and unchanged throughout the whole negotiation process. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ID WORKER DIFFERENCES; ASSIGNMENT; TASKS
AB In humans, the relationship between experience and productivity, also known as learning (possibly also including forgetting), is non-linear. As a result, prescriptive planning models that seek to manage workforce development through task assignment are difficult to solve. To overcome this challenge we adapt a reformulation technique from non-convex optimization to model non-linear functions with a discrete domain with sets of binary and continuous variables and linear constraints. Further, whereas the original applications of this technique yielded approximations, we show that in our context the resulting mixed integer program is equivalent to the original non-linear problem. As a second contribution, we introduce a capacity scaling algorithm that exploits the structure of the reformulation model and reduces computation time. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the techniques on task assignment models wherein employee learning is a function of task repetition. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB We focus on multicriteria preference elicitation by matching. In this widely employed task, the decision maker (DM) is presented with two multicriteria options, a and b, and must assess the performance value on one criterion for b, left blank, so that she is indifferent between the two options. A reverse matching, which is normatively equivalent, can be created by integrating the answer to the description of b and letting the DM adjust a performance value on the previously totally specified option a. Such a procedure is called a bi-matching. Consistency requires that isopreferences resulting from the forward and backward matchings be identical, but they empirically differ in a systematic direction. In a matching task, multicriteria conflict refers to the magnitude of the advantage or disadvantage to be compensated. We investigate the effect of the multicriteria conflict, or trade-off size, on the difference of judgement between forward and backward matchings. We observed that the difference of judgement is increased both by multicriteria conflict and by asking deteriorating rather than improving judgements at both steps of the bi-matching. We derive some implications for the practice of preference elicitation. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB We consider a simple and altruistic multiagent system in which the agents are eager to perform a collective task but where their real engagement depends on the willingness to perform the task of other influential agents. We model this scenario by an influence game, a cooperative simple game in which a team (or coalition) of players succeeds if it is able to convince enough agents to participate in the task (to vote in favor of a decision). We take the linear threshold model as the influence model. We show first the expressiveness of influence games showing that they capture the class of simple games. Then we characterize the computational complexity of various problems on influence games, including measures (length and width), values (Shapley-Shubik and Banzhaf) and properties (of teams and players). Finally, we analyze those problems for some particular extremal cases, with respect to the propagation of influence, showing tighter complexity characterizations. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB The wheels are one of the most worn components on a train. When the wear is unacceptable, the re-profiling can restore the shape of the wheel flange with the cost of decreasing the wheel diameter. The decision of re-profiling has serious implications for the life span of wheels. In this paper, based on the analysis of the wear and re-profiling characteristics of metro wheels, a data-driven model of the relationship between the wheel diameter, the flange thickness, their wear rates, and the re-profiling gain is built for the wheels of Guangzhou Metro Line One. A (S-dp,S-dR) re-profiling strategy is proposed, where Sdp is the wheel flange thickness threshold to trigger a preventive re-profiling and S-dp is the wheel flange thickness after the preventive re-profiling. Then the Monte Carlo simulation model of the re-profiling strategy is described in this paper. To find out when a re-profiling should be performed in terms of the flange wear-out level and what values of the flange thickness should be brought to by re-profiling, the simulation results for optimizing the decision variables (Sdp, SdR) of the re-profiling strategy are given in this paper. Those having longer life spans are listed as the preferred re-profiling strategies. The study in this paper reveals that the wear rate of the flange thickness is correlated with the flange thickness, while the diameter wear rate could be considered independent of the flange thickness in terms of the wheels of Guangzhou Metro Line One. On the other hand, based on the observation and analysis of an available sample set from Guangzhou Metro Line One, the re-profiling gain is dependent on the flange thickness before or after re-profiling. The preferred re-profiling strategies suggested by this study can increase the life span comparing with the existing re-profiling strategies based on the simulation. The models and methods presented in this paper could benefit both city metro companies and inter-city rail companies by prolonging the life span of rolling stock wheels. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB This paper proposes an agent-based simulation model to study and analyse the performance of various procurement and production policies in the recycled paper industry. The proposed model includes the recycled pulp production process, as well as the waste paper inventory and procurement processes. A detailed simulation model developed in partnership with a large recycled pulp producer in North America was developed in order to emulate the procurement manager's behaviour. Therefore, based on the observed behaviour of the procurement manager, a procurement behaviour model, which takes both market price and inventory requirement into account, is introduced. This paper also introduces a waste paper market model that simulates a market price and enables the control of price forecast accuracy. Two series of experiments were carried out in order to study the performance of procurement and production policies in several productions contexts. Results show that production Volume Flexibility has a negative impact on costs, inventory and quality. However, it is possible to partially reduce these issues with the introduction of contracts with Volume Flexibility, although only a limited effect has been observed in our experiments. A more significant strategy to improve costs consists in reducing production rate to the minimum level required to meet demand. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ID UNITED-STATES; PERFORMANCE; EFFICIENCY; SERVICES
AB The complexity of air traffic flow management has its groundwork at an airport and increases with the number of daily aircraft departures and arrivals. To adequately contribute toward an accelerated air traffic flow management (ATfM), multivariate statistical models were developed based on airport utility. The utility functions were derived from daily probabilities of airport delay and inefficiencies computed using parameterized statistical models. The estimates were based on logistic and stochastic frontier models to derive distribution functions from which daily airport utilities were estimated. Data for testing and model simulations are daily aggregates spanning a five year period, collected from Entebbe International Airport. The utility models show that there was a 2 percent difference between daily aircraft operations at departures (92 percent) and at arrivals (94 percent). These findings confirm the likelihood that events leading to departures are more rigid compared to those observed at aircraft arrivals. Simulation results further confirmed that lowering delays at departure and arrival would result into higher airport utility. Airport utility was found to decrease consistently with an increase in the air-to-ground cost ratios. Airport utility analyses were most stable at a delay threshold of 60 percent and an air-to-ground cost ratio of 1.6 for both departures and arrivals. Therefore, for better outcomes of airport utility studies, this study recommends different treatments between departure and arrival analyses. The models developed are flexible and easily replicable with little adjustments to reflect airport specific characteristics. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The developed model allows us to simultaneously represent the interactions of several market players, to endogenously determine output and steel prices and to analyze the investment in the Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) technology. In addition, the proposed model supports the evaluation of the CO2 emission costs on the basis of Directive 2009/29/EC, the "20-20-20" targets, and the Energy Roadmap 2050. In this light, two main processes for steelmaking have to be considered: integrated mills (BOF) and Electric Arc Furnace (EAF) in minimills. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This paper studies the multiple runway Aircraft Landing Problem. The aim is to schedule arriving aircraft to available runways at the airport. Landing times lie within predefined time windows and safety separation constraints between two successive landings must be satisfied. We propose a new approach for solving the problem. The method is based on an approximation of the separation time matrix and on time discretization. The separation matrix is approximated by a rank two matrix. This provides lower bounds or upper bounds depending on the choice of the approximating matrix. These bounds are used in a constraint generation algorithm to, exactly or heuristically, solve the problem. Computational tests, performed on publicly available problems involving up to 500 aircraft, show the efficiency of the approach. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The Vehicle Routing Problem with Simultaneous Pickup and Delivery with Time Limit (VRPSPDTL) is a variant of the basic Vehicle Routing Problem where the vehicles serve delivery as well as pick up operations of the clients under time limit restrictions. The VRPSPDTL determines a set of vehicle routes originating and terminating at a central depot such that the total travel distance is minimized. For this problem, we propose a mixed-integer mathematical optimization model and a perturbation based neighborhood search algorithm combined with the classic savings heuristic, variable neighborhood search and a perturbation mechanism. The numerical results show that the proposed method produces superior solutions for a number of well-known benchmark problems compared to those reported in the literature and reasonably good solutions for the remaining test problems.

AB A Vendor Managed Inventory (VMI) partnership places the responsibility on the vendor (rather than on buyers) to schedule purchase orders for inventory replenishment in the supply chain system. In this research, the supply chain network considers the Silver-Meal heuristic with an augmentation quantity replenishment policy between both traditional and VMI systems. We consider time-varying stochastic demand in two-echelon (one vendor, multiple retailers) supply chains. This paper seeks to find the supply chain that minimizes system cost through comparing performance between traditional and VMI systems. A mathematical model is developed, and total supply chain cost is used as the measure of comparison. The models are applied in both traditional and VMI supply chains based on pharmaceutical industry data, and we focus on total cost difference compared through the use of Adjusted Silver-Meal (ASM) and Least Unit Cost heuristics. Finally, a numerical example and a sensitivity analysis are also illustrated to show the applicability of the model. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB We consider a single-echelon continuous review inventory system for spare parts with two parallel locations. Each location faces independent Poisson demand and backorders are allowed. In this paper we consider the possibility of lateral transshipments between the locations. The transshipment leadtime is positive and deterministic, and there is an additional cost for making a transshipment. We suggest a transshipment policy which is based on the timing of all outstanding orders, and develop and solve a heuristic model by using theory and concepts from doubly stochastic Poisson processes and also partial differential equations. A simulation study indicates that our heuristic works very well, and that the relative cost increase of disregarding the transshipment leadtime may be quite high. Our results also indicate that it is, in general, worth the effort of reducing the transshipment leadtime, even if it is already relatively short. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The economical and environmental benefits are the central issues for remanufacturing. Whereas extant remanufacturing research focuses primarily on such issues in remanufacturing technologies, production planning, inventory control and competitive strategies, we provide an alternative yet somewhat complementary approach to consider both issues related to different channels structures for marketing remanufactured products. Specifically, based on observations from current practice, we consider a manufacturer sells new units through an independent retailer but with two options for marketing remanufactured products: (1) marketing through its own e-channel (Model M) or (2) subcontracting the marketing activity to a third party (Model 3P). A central result we obtain is that although Model M is always greener than Model 3P, firms have less incentive to adopt it because both the manufacturer and retailer may be worse off when the manufacturer sells remanufactured products through its own e-channel rather than subcontracting to a third party. Extending both models to cases in which the manufacturer interacts with multiple retailers further reveals that the more retailers in the market, the greener Model M relative to Model 3P.

AB Positive Mathematical Programming (PMP) is one of the most commonly used methods for calibrating activity programming models. In this article we consider PMP as a calibration method for risk programming models with a mean-variance (E-V) specification. We argue that the restrictive theoretical assumptions employed by typical linear E-V models limit their applicability in analyzing the effects of decoupled payments on agricultural production decisions. Furthermore, the requirement for eliciting a risk aversion coefficient renders such models incompatible with the PMP method. For this reason we propose a nonlinear E-V specification and develop a PMP-based procedure for its calibration which does not aim at introducing (further) nonlinearities in the objective function, but at recovering the "true" distribution of wealth that will allow the final model to reproduce base year observations. We also examine how our approach relates to the recent PMP developments on calibration against elasticity priors and we show how such priors can be used for the calibration of the nonlinear E-V model.

AB Model risk has a huge impact on any risk measurement procedure and its quantification is therefore a crucial step. In this paper, we introduce three quantitative measures of model risk when choosing a particular reference model within a given class: the absolute measure of model risk, the relative measure of model risk and the local measure of model risk. Each of the measures has a specific purpose and so allows for flexibility. We illustrate the various notions by studying some relevant examples, so as to emphasize the practicability and tractability of our approach. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ID NON-CONVEXITIES; EQUILIBRIUM; PRICES; POOL
AB We consider the optimization problem implementing current market rules for European day-ahead electricity markets. We propose improved algorithmic approaches for that problem. First, a new MIP formulation is presented which avoids the use of complementarity constraints to express market equilibrium conditions, and also avoids the introduction of auxiliary continuous or binary variables. Instead, we rely on strong duality theory for linear or convex quadratic optimization problems to recover equilibrium constraints. When so-called stepwise bid curves are considered to describe continuous bids, the new formulation allows to take full advantage of state-of-the-art MILP solvers, and in most cases, an optimal solution including market prices can be computed for large-scale instances without any further algorithmic work. Second, the new formulation suggests a Benders-like decomposition procedure. This helps in the case of piecewise linear bid curves that yield quadratic primal and dual objective functions leading to a dense quadratic constraint in the formulation. This procedure essentially strengthens classical Benders cuts locally. Computational experiments using 2011 historical instances for the Central Western Europe region show excellent results. In the linear case, both approaches are very efficient, while for quadratic instances, only the decomposition procedure is appropriate. Finally, when most orders are block orders, and instances are combinatorially very hard, the direct MILP approach is substantially more efficient. (C) 2014 Elsevier By. All rights reserved.

AB In this paper, a survey of scheduling problems with due windows is presented. The due window of a job is a generalization of the classical due date and it is a time interval in which this job should be finished. If the job is completed before or after the due window, it incurs an earliness or a tardiness penalty. A review of an extensive literature concerning problems with various models of given due windows, due window assignment and job-independent and job-dependent earliness/tardiness penalties is presented. The article focuses mainly on the computational complexity of the problems, mentioning also their solution algorithms. Moreover, the practical applications of the reviewed problems are mentioned, giving the appropriate references to the scientific literature. One particularly interesting IT example is described in detail. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB We study the capacitated k-facility location problem, in which we are given a set of clients with demands, a set of facilities with capacities and a positive integer k. It costs f(i) to open facility i, and c(ij) for facility i to serve one unit of demand from client j. The objective is to open at most k facilities serving all the demands and satisfying the capacity constraints while minimizing the sum of service and opening costs.
   In this paper, we give the first fully polynomial time approximation scheme (FPTAS) for the single-sink (single-client) capacitated k-facility location problem. Then, we show that the capacitated k-facility location problem with uniform capacities is solvable in polynomial time if the number of clients is fixed by reducing it to a collection of transportation problems. Third, we analyze the structure of extreme point solutions, and examine the efficiency of this structure in designing approximation algorithms for capacitated k-facility location problems. Finally, we extend our results to obtain an improved approximation algorithm for the capacitated facility location problem with uniform opening costs. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In this paper we introduce a time-dependent probabilistic location model for Emergency Medical Service (EMS) vehicles. The goal is to maximize the expected coverage throughout the day and at the same time minimize the number of opened facilities and the number of relocations. We apply our model to both a randomly generated test instance and to data from the city of Amsterdam, the Netherlands. We see that time-dependent models can result in better solutions than time-independent models. Furthermore, we see that the current set of base locations in Amsterdam is not optimal. We can obtain higher coverage with even less base locations. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The work reported in this paper addresses the problem of transmission expansion planning under uncertainty in an electric energy system. We consider different sources of uncertainty, including future demand growth and the availability of generation facilities, which are characterized for different regions within the electric energy system. An adaptive robust optimization model is used to derive the investment decisions that minimizes the system's total costs by anticipating the worst case realization of the uncertain parameters within an uncertainty set. The proposed formulation materializes on a mixed-integer three-level optimization problem whose lower-level problem can be replaced by its KKT optimality conditions. The resulting mixed-integer bilevel model is efficiently solved by decomposition using a cutting plane algorithm. A realistic case study is used to illustrate the working of the proposed technique, and to analyze the relationship between the optimal transmission investment plans, the investment budget and the level of supply security at the different regions of the network.

Explicit expressions for several SARMA models are obtained to illustrate the key relationship between lead-time and seasonal lag.

AB We consider the output processes of some elementary queueing models such as the M/M/1/K queue and the M/G/1 queue. An important performance measure for these counting processes is their variance curve v(t), which gives the variance of the number of customers in the time interval [0, t]. Recent work has revealed some non-trivial properties dealing with the asymptotic rate at which the variance curve grows. In this paper we add to these results by finding explicit expressions for the intercept term of the linear asymptote.
   For M/M/1/K queues our results are based on the deviation matrix of the generator. It turns out that by viewing output processes as Markovian Point Processes and considering the deviation matrix, one can obtain explicit expressions for the intercept term, together with some further insight regarding the BRAVO (Balancing Reduces Asymptotic Variance of Outputs) effect. For M/G/1 queues our results are based on a classic transform of D. J. Daley. In this case we represent the intercept term of the variance curve in terms of the first three moments of the service time distribution. In addition we shed light on a conjecture of Daley, dealing with characterization of stationary M/M/1 queues within the class of stationary M/G/1 queues, based on the variance curve.

ID OPTIMIZATION; NETWORKS; ALLOCATION; COMPLEXITY; MODELS
AB We investigate project scheduling with stochastic activity durations to maximize the expected net present value. Individual activities also carry a risk of failure, which can cause the overall project to fail. In the project planning literature, such technological uncertainty is typically ignored and project plans are developed only for scenarios in which the project succeeds. To mitigate the risk that an activity's failure jeopardizes the entire project, more than one alternative may exist for reaching the project's objectives. We propose a model that incorporates both the risk of activity failure and the possible pursuit of alternative technologies. We find optimal solutions to the scheduling problem by means of stochastic dynamic programming. Our algorithms prescribe which alternatives need to be explored, and how they should be scheduled. We also examine the impact of the variability of the activity durations on the project's value. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In order to maintain a unit that is running successive works with cycle times, this paper classifies its replacement policies into three types: (Type I) Replacement with interrupted cycles; (Type II) replacement with complete works; and (Type III) replacement with incomplete works. Type I is typically done at a continuous time T while Type II is executed at a discrete number N of working cycles. Type III is proposed as an improvement of Type I, which can be done at discrete working cycles. For each type, age and periodic replacement models are respectively observed. It is shown that Type I is more flexible than Type II and costs less than Type III. However, modified replacement costs, i.e., without penalty of operational interruptions, are obtained for Types II and III as critical points at which their policies should be adopted. All discussions are presented analytically and numerical examples are given when each cycle time is exponential and the failure time has a Weibull distribution. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

ID INVENTORY CONTROL; YIELD; UNCERTAINTY; DEMAND
AB This paper studies a firm's time-to-market decision and subsequent sales channel, pricing and production decisions under three main sources of uncertainty: possibility of qualifying for lucrative sales channels, competitors' time-to-market behavior and price-sensitive uncertain demand. In particular, we consider a firm that can potentially sell through two distinct channels. Selling through the primary channel requires the firm to first get its product qualified. The secondary channel does not require qualification. Prior to market entry, the firm performs product and process design activities which improve manufacturing yield and the chances of getting qualified for the primary sales channel. A long delay in market entry allows competitors to enter the market before the firm, reducing the firm's market share. This delay also affects the firm's sales channel strategy. While deciding when to enter the market, the firm also needs to decide what price to charge and how much to produce at each period of a finite planning horizon. Demand distributions depend on the product's price through general stochastic demand functions. Pricing and production decisions can be specified dynamically as a function of the state of the system and they are intertwined with the time-to-market decision. The paper provides a unified model that captures the key relationships and trade-offs among time-to-market, sales channel, pricing and production decisions. Explicitly modeling the linkages among these key decisions enables us to characterize and quantify their joint role in profit generation. This paper provides managers with a tool and a process that can guide them in determining an optimal policy for market-timing, pricing and production decisions that maximize firms' expected profits.

AB This paper considers a contest setting in which a challenger chooses between one of two contests to enter after observing the level of defense at each. Despite the challenger's chance of success being determined by a proportional contest success function, the defenders effectively find themselves in an all-pay auction that largely dissipates the value of the defended resources because the challenger will target the weaker defender. However, if the defenders form a protective alliance then their expected profits increase despite the fact that a successful challenge is theoretically more likely, given the overall reduction in defense. Controlled laboratory experiments designed to test the model's predictions are also reported. Observed behavior is generally consistent with the comparative static predictions although challengers exhibit the familiar overbidding pattern. Defenders appear to anticipate this reaction and adjust their behavior accordingly. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Standard mean-variance analysis is based on the assumption of normal return distributions. However, a growing body of literature suggests that the market oscillates between two different regimes - one with low volatility and the other with high volatility. In such a case, even if the return distributions are normal in both regimes, the overall distribution is not - it is a mixture of normals. Mean-variance analysis is inappropriate in this framework, and one must either assume a specific utility function or, alternatively, employ the more general and distribution-free Second degree Stochastic Dominance (SSD) criterion. This paper develops the SSD rule for the case of mixed normals: the SSDMN rule. This rule is a generalization the mean-variance rule. The cost of ignoring regimes and assuming normality when the distributions are actually mixed normal can be quite substantial - it is typically equivalent to an annual rate of return of 2-3 percent.

AB This paper uses Monte Carlo Data Envelopment Analysis (Monte Carlo DEA) to evaluate the relative technical efficiency of small health care areas in probabilistic terms with respect to both mental health care as well as the efficiency of the whole system. Taking into account that the number of areas did not permit maximum discrimination to be achieved, all the scenarios of non-correlated inputs and outputs of a specific size were designed using Monte Carlo Pearson to maximize the discrimination of Monte Carlo DEA and the information included in the models. A knowledge base was included in the simulation engine in order to guide the dynamic interpretation of non-standard inputs and outputs. Results show the probability that all DMU and the whole system have of being efficient, as well as the specific inputs and outputs that make the areas or the system efficient or inefficient, along with a classification of the areas into four groups according to their efficiency (k-means cluster analysis). This final classification was compared with an expert-based classification to validate both the knowledge base and the Monte Carlo DEA model. Both classifications showed results that were very similar although not exactly the same, basically due to the difficulty experts experience in recognizing "intermediately-inefficient" DMU. We propose this methodology as an instrument that could help health care managers to assess relative technical efficiency in complex systems under uncertainty. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB Pairwise comparison (PC) is a well-established method to assist decision makers in estimating their preferences. In PCs, the acquired judgments are used to construct a PC matrix (PCM) that is used to check whether the inconsistency in judgments is acceptable or requires revision. The use of Consistency Ratio (CR) a widely used measure for inconsistency has been widely debated and the literature survey has identified a need for a more appropriate measure. Considering this need, a new measure, termed congruence, is proposed in this paper. The measure is shown to be useful in finding the contribution of individual judgments toward overall inconsistency of a PCM and, therefore, can be used to detect and correct cardinally inconsistent judgments. The proposed measure is applicable to incomplete sets of PC judgments without modification, unlike CR which requires a complete set of PC judgments. To address ordinal inconsistency, another measure termed dissonance, is proposed as a supplement to the congruence measure. The two measures appear useful in detecting both outliers and the phenomenon of consistency deadlock where all judgments equally contribute toward the overall inconsistency. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB This paper presents two new procedures for ranking and selection (R&S) problems where the best system designs are selected from a set of competing ones based on multiple performance measures evaluated through stochastic simulation. In the procedures, the performance measures are aggregated with a multiattribute utility function, and incomplete preference information regarding the weights that reflect the relative importance of the measures is taken into account. A set of feasible weights is determined according to preference statements that are linear constraints on the weights given by a decision-maker. Non-dominated designs are selected using two dominance relations referred to as pairwise and absolute dominance based on estimates for the expected utilities of the designs over the feasible weights. The procedures allocate a limited number of simulation replications among the designs such that the probabilities of correctly selecting the pairwise and absolutely non-dominated designs are maximized.
   The new procedures offer ease of eliciting the weights compared with existing R&S procedures that aggregate the performance measures using unique weights. Moreover, computational advantages are provided over existing procedures that identify non-dominated designs based on the expected values of the performance measures. The new procedures allow to obtain a smaller number of non-dominated designs. They also identify these designs correctly with a higher probability or require a smaller number of replications for correct selection. Finally, the new procedures allocate a larger number of replications to the non-dominated designs that are therefore evaluated with greater accuracy. These computational advantages are illustrated through several numerical experiments. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Material use of agricultural raw materials as renewable resources is gaining increasing importance in industrial production. Seasonal availability as well as variations in raw material quantity and quality and of market prices need to be considered in supply planning. This research depicts the planning problem of a processor of agricultural raw materials and illustrates it with data on the industrial use of linseed oil, which is a promising raw material for the production of new polymers. A two-stage stochastic program provides decision support and is applied to the example. The approach can be used for a variety of planning problems concerning the supply of agricultural raw materials. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The construction of composite indicators (Cl) is useful to synthesize complex social and economic phenomena, but some underlying assumptions in "classical methods", as in particular the compensability among indicators, are very strictly. The aim of this paper is to propose an original approach that enhance non-compensatory issue by introducing "directional" penalties in a Benefit of the Doubt model in order to consider the preference structure among simple indicators. Principal component analysis on simple indicators hyperplane allows to estimate both the direction and the intensity of the average rates of substitution.

ID MISSION AIRCRAFT
AB We address the Flight and Maintenance Planning (FMP) problem, i.e., the problem of deciding which available aircraft to fly and for how long, and which grounded aircraft to perform maintenance operations on in a group of aircraft that comprise a unit. The aim is to maximize the unit fleet availability over a multi-period planning horizon, while also ensuring that certain flight and maintenance requirements are satisfied. Heuristic approaches that are used in practice to solve the FMP problem often perform poorly, generating solutions that are far from the optimum. On the other hand, the exact optimization models that have been developed to tackle the problem handle small problems effectively, but tend to be computationally inefficient for larger problems, such as the ones that arise in practice. With these in mind, we develop an exact solution algorithm for the FMP problem, which is capable of identifying the optimal solution of considerably large realistic problems in reasonable computational times. The algorithm solves suitable relaxations of the original problem, utilizing valid cuts that guide the search towards the optimal solution. We present extensive experimental results, which demonstrate that the algorithm's performance on realistic problems is superior to that of two popular commercial optimization software packages, whereas the opposite is true for a class of problems with special characteristics that deviate considerably from those of realistic problems. The important conclusion of this research is that the proposed algorithm, complemented by generic optimization software, can handle effectively a large variety of FMP problem instances.

ID MICROCHP SCHEDULING PROBLEM; ALGORITHMS; COMPLEXITY; MODELS; TIME
AB This paper studies planning problems for a group of heating systems which supply the hot water demand for domestic use in houses. These systems (e.g. gas or electric boilers, heat pumps or microCHPs) use an external energy source to heat up water and store this hot water for supplying the domestic demands. The latter allows to some extent a decoupling of the heat production from the heat demand. We focus on the situation where each heating system has its own demand and buffer and the supply of the heating systems is coming from a common source. In practice, the common source may lead to a coupling of the planning for the group of heating systems. On the one hand, the external supply of the energy for heating up the water may have to be bought by an energy supplier on e.g. a day-ahead market. As the price of energy varies over time on such markets, this supplier is interested in a planning which minimizes the total cost to supply the heating systems with energy. On the other hand, the bottleneck to supply the energy also may be the capacity of the distribution system (e.g. the electricity networks or the gas network). As this has to be dimensioned for the maximal consumption, in this case it is important to minimize the maximal peak.
   The two mentioned coupling constraints for supplying the energy for producing the heat, lead to two different objectives for the planning of the group of heating systems: minimizing cost and minimizing the maximal peak. In this paper, we study the algorithmic complexity of the two resulting planning problems. For minimizing costs, a classical dynamic programming approach is given which solves the problem in polynomial time. On the other hand, we prove that minimizing the maximal peak is NP-hard and discuss why this problem is hard. Based on this, we show that this problem becomes polynomial if all heating systems have the same consumption of energy when turned on. Finally, we present a Fix Parameter Tractable (FPT) algorithm for minimizing the maximal peak which is linear in the number of time intervals. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB We analyze the impact of managerial compensation structure in publicly-traded banks on their risk taking behavior, specifically the changes in risk taking through the changing regulatory environment for these banks. We perform a simulation analysis to study the impact of the interaction between regulatory changes and competitiveness in banking on managerial compensation, and in turn their joint impact on a bank's riskiness. The three hypotheses we examine using the simulation analysis are, (1) increase in competitiveness after deregulation results in higher levels of risk for banks, (2) regulatory changes can result in change in the composition of managerial compensation, which creates an environment of incentives for enhanced risk taking, (3) regulatory changes accompanied by certain governance or managerial compensation controls can bring prudence in the risk taking behavior. The simulation model allows isolating each factor for its impact on a particular bank's riskiness due to the regulatory changes. This impact is then correlated with the governance characteristics of the bank. We observe that competition uniformly increases the risk in firm value and shareholder-equity of all the banks, more severely for some than others. Its effect on change of firm value through regulatory changes observed is opposite from its effect on shareholder-equity for some banks. Change in competition combined with change in managerial compensation captures significantly more of the increased risk in firm value and shareholder-equity. Lastly, the governance characteristics show that risk differential between competition alone and competition combined with compensation is low for banks with good governance. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB One of the most critical barriers to widespread adoption of electric cars is the lack of charging station infrastructure. Although it is expected that a sufficient number of charging stations will be constructed eventually, due to various practical reasons they may have to be introduced gradually over time. In this paper, we formulate a multi-period optimization model based on a flow-refueling location model for strategic charging station location planning, We also propose two myopic methods and develop a case study based on the real traffic flow data of the Korean Expressway network in 2011. We discuss the performance of the three proposed methods. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This paper investigates the 2D guillotine knapsack packing problem, in which the objective is to select and cut a set of rectangles from a sheet with fixed size and maximize the total profit of the selected rectangles. The orientation of the rectangles is fixed. And the guillotine cut, in which the cut must be parallel to the sides of the sheet to divide it into two completely separated sheets, is required. Two well-known methods, namely the top-down and bottom-up approaches, are combined into a coherent algorithm to address this problem. Computational experiments on benchmark test sets show that the approach finds the optimal solution for almost all moderately sized instances and outperforms all existing approaches for larger instances.

AB With the ongoing trend of mass-customization and an increasing product variety, just-in-time part logistics more and more becomes one of the greatest challenges in today's automobile production. Thousands of parts and suppliers, a multitude of different equipments, and hundreds of logistics workers need to be coordinated, so that the final assembly lines never run out of parts. This paper describes the elementary process steps of part logistics in the automotive industry starting with the initial call order to the return of empty part containers. In addition to a detailed process description, important decision problems are specified, existing literature is surveyed, and open research challenges are identified. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

DE Markov decision process; Dividend payout; Risk aversion;
   History-dependent policy; Fixed point problem
ID MARKOV DECISION-PROCESSES; CRITERION
AB We consider a discrete time version of the popular optimal dividend payout problem in risk theory. The novel aspect of our approach is that we allow for a risk averse insurer, i.e., instead of maximising the expected discounted dividends until ruin we maximise the expected utility of discounted dividends until ruin. This task has been proposed as an open problem in Gerber and Shiu (2004). The model in a continuous-time Brownian motion setting with the exponential utility function has been analysed in Grandits et al. (2007). Nevertheless, a complete solution has not been provided. In this work, instead we solve the problem in discrete time setup for the exponential and the power utility functions and give the structure of optimal history-dependent dividend policies. We make use of certain ideas studied earlier in Bauerle and Rieder (2011), where Markov decision processes with general utility functions were treated. Our analysis, however, includes new aspects, since the reward functions in this case are not bounded. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In this research, critical infrastructure protection against intentional attacks is modeled as a discrete simultaneous game between the protector and the attacker, to model the situation that both players keep the information of their resource allocation secret. We prove that keeping the information regarding protection strategies secret can obtain a better effect of critical infrastructure protection than truthfully disclosing it. Solving a game theoretic problem, even in the case of two players, has been known to be intractable. To deal with this complexity, after proving that pure-strategy Nash equilibrium solutions do not exist for the proposed simultaneous game, a new approach is proposed to identify its mixed-strategy Nash equilibrium solution.

AB Distribution companies that serve a very large number of customers, courier companies for example, often partition the geographical region served by a depot into zones. Each zone is assigned to a single vehicle and each vehicle serves a single zone. An alternative approach is to partition the distribution region into smaller microzones that are assigned to a preferred vehicle in a so-called tactical plan. The moment the workload in each microzone is known, the microzones can be reassigned to vehicles in such a way that the total distance traveled is minimized, the workload of the different vehicles is balanced, and as many microzones as possible are assigned to their preferred vehicle.
   In this paper we model the resulting microzone-based vehicle routing problem as a multi-objective optimization problem and develop a simple yet effective algorithm to solve it. We analyze this algorithm and discuss the results it obtains. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

   SYSTEM; FOREST MANAGEMENT; RISK-AVERSION; VALUE TREES
AB We present a novel approach for practically tackling uncertainty in preference elicitation and predictive modeling to support complex multi-criteria decisions based on multi-attribute utility theory (MAUI). A simplified two-step elicitation procedure consisting of an online survey and face-to-face interviews is followed by an extensive uncertainty analysis. This covers uncertainty of the preference components (marginal value and utility functions, hierarchical aggregation functions, aggregation parameters) and the attribute predictions. Context uncertainties about future socio-economic developments are captured by combining MAUT with scenario planning. We perform a global sensitivity analysis (GSA) to assess the contribution of single uncertain preference parameters to the uncertainty of the ranking of alternatives. This is exemplified for sustainable water infrastructure planning in a case study in Switzerland. We compare 11 water supply alternatives ranging from conventional water supply systems to novel technologies and management schemes regarding 44 objectives. Their performance is assessed for four future scenarios and 10 stakeholders from different backgrounds and decision-making levels. Despite uncertainty in the ranking of alternatives, potential best and worst solutions could be identified. We demonstrate that a priori assumptions such as linear value functions or additive aggregation can result in misleading recommendations, unless thoroughly checked during preference elicitation and modeling. We suggest GSA to focus elicitation on most sensitive preference parameters. Our GSA results indicate that output uncertainty can be considerably reduced by additional elicitation of few parameters, e.g. the overall risk attitude and aggregation functions at higher-level nodes. Here, rough value function elicitation was sufficient, thereby substantially reducing elicitation time. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Businesses are increasingly subject to disruptions. It is almost impossible to predict their nature, time and extent. Therefore, organizations need a proactive approach equipped with a decision support framework to protect themselves against the outcomes of disruptive events. In this paper, a novel framework is proposed for integrated business continuity and disaster recovery planning for efficient and effective resuming and recovering of critical operations after being disrupted. The proposed model addresses decision problems at all strategic, tactical and operational levels. At the strategic level, the context of the organization is first explored and the main features of the organizational resilience are recognized. Then, a new multi-objective mixed integer linear programming model is formulated to allocate internal and external resources to both resuming and recovery plans simultaneously. The model aims to control the loss of resilience by maximizing recovery point and minimizing recovery time objectives. Finally, at the operational level, hypothetical disruptive events are examined to evaluate the applicability of the plans. We also develop a novel interactive augmented epsilon-constraint method to find the final preferred compromise solution. The proposed model and solution method are finally validated through a real case study. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Traditional bankruptcy prediction models, designed using classification or regression techniques, achieve short-term performances (1 year) that are fairly good, but that often worsen when the prediction horizon exceeds 1 year. We show how to improve the performance of such models beyond 1 year using models that take into account the evolution of firm's financial health over a short period of time. For this purpose, we design models that fit the underlying failure process of different groups of firms. Our results demonstrate that such models lead to better prediction accuracy at a 3-year horizon than that achieved with common models. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A novel self-adaptive variable-size multi-objective differential evolution algorithm is presented to find the best reconfiguration of existing on-orbit satellites for some particular targets on the ground when an emergent requirement arises in a short period. The main contribution of this study is that three coverage metrics are designed to assess the performance of the reconfiguration. Proposed algorithm utilizes the idea of fixed-length chromosome encoding scheme combined with expression vector and the modified initialization, mutation, crossover and selection operators to search for optimal reconfiguration structure. Multi-subpopulation diversity initialization is adopted first, then the mutation based on estimation of distribution algorithm and adaptive crossover operators are defined to manipulate variable-length chromosomes, and finally a new selection mechanism is employed to generate well-distributed individuals for the next generation. The proposed algorithm is applied to three characteristically different case studies, with the objective to improve the performance with respect to specified targets by minimizing fuel consumption and maneuver time. The results show that the algorithm can effectively find the approximate Pareto solutions under different topological structures. A comparative analysis demonstrates that the proposed algorithm outperforms two other related multi-objective evolutionary optimization algorithms in terms of quality, convergence and diversity metrics.

AB Given a set N, a pairwise distance function d and an integer number m, the Dispersion Problems (DPs) require to extract from N a subset M of cardinality m, so as to optimize a suitable function of the distances between the elements in M. Different functions give rise to a whole family of combinatorial optimization problems. In particular, the max-sum DP and the max-min DP have received strong attention in the literature. Other problems (e.g., the max-minsum DP and the min-diffsum DP) have been recently proposed with the aim to model the optimization of equity requirements, as opposed to that of more classical efficiency requirements. Building on the main ideas which underly some state-of-the-art methods for the max-sum DP and the max-min DP, this work proposes some constructive procedures and a Tabu Search algorithm for the new problems. In particular, we investigate the extension to the new context of key features such as initialization, tenure management and diversification mechanisms. The computational experiments show that the algorithms applying these ideas perform effectively on the publicly available benchmarks, but also that there are some interesting differences with respect to the DPs more studied in the literature. As a result of this investigation, we also provide optimal results and bounds as a useful reference for further studies. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF OPERATIONAL RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
DE Flow shop; Synchronous movement; Complexity; Dominating machines
ID ONE MACHINE; TRANSFERS
AB In this paper we present complexity results for flow shop problems with synchronous movement which are a variant of a non-preemptive permutation flow shop. Jobs have to be moved from one machine to the next by an unpaced synchronous transportation system, which implies that the processing is organized in synchronized cycles. This means that in each cycle the current jobs start at the same time on the corresponding machines and after processing have to wait until the last job is finished. Afterwards, all jobs are moved to the next machine simultaneously.
   Besides the general situation we also investigate special cases involving machine dominance which means that the processing times of all jobs on a dominating machine are at least as large as the processing times of all jobs on the other machines. Especially, we study flow shops with synchronous movement for a small number of dominating machines (one or two) and different objective functions. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
