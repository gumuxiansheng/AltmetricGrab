AB In this paper, we study the problem of minimizing the maximum total completion time per machine on m parallel and identical machines. We prove that the problem is strongly NP-hard if m is a part of the input. When m is a given number, a pseudo-polynomial time dynamic programming is proposed. We also show that the worst-case ratio of SPT is at most 2.608 and at least 2.5366 when m is sufficiently large. We further present another algorithm which has a worst-case ratio of 2.

AB We study an incremental network design problem, where in each time period of the planning horizon an arc can be added to the network and a maximum flow problem is solved, and where the objective is to maximize the cumulative flow over the entire planning horizon. After presenting two mixed integer programming (MIP) formulations for this NP-complete problem, we describe several heuristics and prove performance bounds for some special cases. In a series of computational experiments, we compare the performance of the MIP formulations as well as the heuristics. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ID RETRIEVAL-SYSTEMS; STORAGE; NETWORKS; TECHNOLOGY; POLICIES
AB Technological innovations in warehouse automation systems, such as Autonomous Vehicle based Storage and Retrieval System (AVS/RS), are geared towards achieving greater operational efficiency and flexibility that would be necessary in warehouses of the future. AVS/RS relies on autonomous vehicles and lifts for horizontal and vertical transfer of unit-loads respectively. To implement a new technology such as AVS/RS, the choice of a design variable setting, interactions among the design variables, and the design trade-offs need to be well understood. In particular, design decisions such as the choice of vehicle dwell-point and location of cross-aisles could significantly affect the performance of an AVS/RS. Hence, we investigate the effect of these design decisions using customized analytical models based on multi-class semi-open queuing network theory. Numerical studies suggest that the average percentage reduction in storage and retrieval transactions with appropriate choice of dwell-point is about 8 percent and 4 percent respectively. While end of aisle location of the cross-aisle is commonly used in practice, our model suggests that there exists a better cross-aisle location within a tier (about 15 percent from end of aisle); however, the cycle time benefits by choosing the optimal cross-aisle location in comparison to the end of aisle cross-aisle location is marginal. Detailed simulations also indicate that the analytical model yields fairly accurate results. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ID QUALITY; INFORMATION; STRATEGIES; MODEL
AB This paper considers returns policies under which consumers' valuation depends on the refund amount they receive and the length of time they must wait after the item is returned. Consumers face an uncertain valuation before purchase, and the realization of that purchase's value occurs only after the return deadline has passed. Depending on the product lifecycle length and magnitude of return rate, a retailer decides on strategies for that product's return deadline, including return prohibition, life-cycle return, and fixed return deadline. In addition, the influence of the return deadline on consumers' behavior and the pricing and inventory policies of the retailer are systematically investigated. Moreover, based on the analysis of consumer return behavior on a traditional buy-back contract, we present a new differentiated buy-back contract, contingent on return deadline, to coordinate a supply chain consisting of an upstream manufacturer and a downstream retailer. Finally, extensions on some specific behavioral factors such as moral hazard, inertia return, and external effect are investigated. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This article analyzes the complexity of the modular tool switching problem arising in flexible manufacturing environments. A single, numerically controlled placement machine is equipped with an online tool magazine consisting of several changeable tool feeder modules. The modules can hold a number of tools necessary for the jobs. In addition to the online modules, there is a set of offline modules which can be changed to the machine during a job change. A number of jobs are processed by the machine, each job requiring a certain set of tools. Tools between jobs can be switched individually, or by replacing a whole module containing multiple tools. or a whole module, containing multiple tools can be replaced. We consider the complexity of the problem of arranging tools into the modules, so that the work for module and tool loading is minimized. Tools are of uniform size and have unit loading costs. We show that the general problem is NP-hard, and in the case of fixed number of modules and fixed module capacity the problem is solvable in polynomial time. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB Under fairly general assumptions requiring neither a differentiable frontier nor a constant-returns-to-scale technology, this paper introduces a new definition of an optimal scale size based on the minimization of unit costs. The corresponding measure, average-cost efficiency, combines scale and allocative efficiency, and generalizes the measurement of scale economies in efficiency analysis while providing a performance criterion which is stricter than both cost efficiency and scale efficiency measurement. The average-cost efficiency is not reliant upon the uniformity of the firms' input-price vector, and we supply procedures to compute it in both convex and non-convex production technologies. Empirical illustration of the theoretical results is given with reference to large sets of production units. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In this paper, we study the finite-time ruin probability in a reasonably generalized dual risk model, where we assume any non-negative non-decreasing cumulative operational cost function and arbitrary capital gains arrival process. Establishing an enlightening link between this dual risk model and its corresponding insurance risk model, explicit expressions for the finite-time survival probability in the dual risk model are obtained under various general assumptions for the distribution of the capital gains. In order to make the model more realistic and general, different dependence structures among capital gains and inter-arrival times and between both are also introduced and corresponding ruin probability expressions are also given. The concept of alarm time, as introduced in Das and Kratz (2012), is applied to the dual risk model within the context of risk capital allocation. Extensive numerical illustrations are provided.

AB We view an administrative activity of issuing parking tickets in a dense city street setting, like downtown Philadelphia or NYC, as a revenue collection activity. The task of designing parking permit inspection routes is modeled as a revenue collecting Chinese Postman Problem. After demonstrating that our design of inspection routes maximizes the expected revenue we investigate decision rules that allow the officers to adjust online their inspection routes in response to the observed parking permits' times. A simple simulation study tests the sensitivity of expected revenues with respect to the problem's parameters and underscores the main conclusion that allowing an officer to selectively wait by parked cars for the expiration of the cars' permits increases the expected revenues between 10% and 69 percent.

ID ROUGH SET APPROACH; DOMINANCE RELATIONS; MULTICRITERIA; MULTIATTRIBUTE;
   APPROXIMATION
AB We are considering induction of ordinal classification rules, which assign objects to preference-ordered decision classes, within the dominance-based rough set approach. In order to extract such rules, it is necessary to define dominance inconsistencies with respect to a set of condition attributes containing at least one ordinal condition attribute. Furthermore, it is also assumed that we know if there exist increasing or decreasing monotonicity relationships between the values of ordinal condition and decision attributes. Very often, however, this information is unknown a priori. One solution to this issue is to transform the ordinal condition attributes with unknown directions of preference to pairs of attributes with supposed inverse monotonic relationships. Both local and global monotonicity relationships can be represented by decision rules induced from transformed decision tables. However, in some cases, transforming a decision table in this way is overcomplex. In this paper, we propose the inconsistency rates based on dominance and fuzzy preference relations that have the capacity of discovering monotonic relationships directly from data rather than induced decision rules. Moreover, we propose a refined transformation method by introducing an additional monotonicity checking using these inconsistency rates to determine whether an ordinal condition attribute should be cloned or not. Experiments are also provided to evaluate the usefulness of the refined transformation method. (C) 2014 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Value-income ratios, such as dividend yields in finance and price-rent ratios in housing and real estate markets, impact society in a variety of ways. This paper proposes a new type of the present value model that features income growth with time-varying yields. It offers a new risk perspective, which may alleviate timid investor behavior in market downturns while cooling down the market in seemingly booming times. A binding relationship, the value-income ratio adjusted by yields of the asset and growth in income, is revealed. This has notable implications for empirical research, which examines value-income ratios time and again. Incorrectly perceived market behavior distorts the formation of investor behavior, and vice versa, which has serious consequences to the functioning of the market and beyond.

ID PHASE-TYPE DISTRIBUTIONS; EM-ALGORITHM
AB In the airline industry, deciding the ticket price for each flight directly affects the number of people that in the future will try to buy a ticket. Depending on the willingness-to-pay of the customers the flight might take off with empty seats or seats sold at a lower price. Therefore, based on the behavior of the customers, a price must be fixed for each type of product in each period. We propose a stochastic dynamic pricing model to solve this problem, applying phase type distributions and renewal processes to model the inter-arrival time between two customers that book a ticket and the probability that a customer buys a ticket. We test this model in a real-world case where as a result the revenue is increased on average by 31 percent. (C) 2014 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB ELECTRE TRI is a set of methods designed to sort alternatives evaluated on several criteria into ordered categories. The original method uses limiting profiles. A recently introduced method uses central profiles. We study the relations between these two methods. We do so by investigating if an ordered partition obtained with one method can also be obtained with the other method, after a suitable redefinition of the profiles. We also investigate a number of situations in which the original method using limiting profiles gives results that do not fit well our intuition. This leads us to propose a variant of ELECTRE TRI that uses limiting profiles. We show that this variant may have some advantages over the original method. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ID INCOMPLETE INFORMATION; CORPORATE-CONTROL; MARKET; DECISIONS; RETURNS;

AB In this paper we provide a model which describes how voluntary disclosure impacts on the timing of a firm's investment decisions. A manager chooses a time to invest in a project and a time to disclose the investment return in order to maximise his monetary payoff. We assume that this payoff is linked to the level of the firm's stock price. Prior to investing, the profitability of the project and the market reaction to the disclosure of the investment return are uncertain, but the manager receives signals at random points in time which assist in resolving some of this uncertainty. We find that a manager whose objective can only be achieved through voluntarily disclosing the return is motivated to invest at a time that would be sub-optimal for an identical manager with a profit maximising objective.

AB Emergency medical services (EMS) assist different classes of patients according to their medical seriousness. In this study, we extended the well-known hypercube model, based on the theory of spatially distributed queues, to analyze systems with multiple priority classes and a queue for waiting customers. Then, we analyzed the computational results obtained when applying this approach to a case study from an urban EMS in the city of Ribeirao Preto, Brazil. We also investigated some scenarios for this system studying different periods of the day and the impact of increasing the demands of the patient classes. The results showed that relevant performance measures can be obtained to analyze such a system by using the analytical model extended to deal with queuing priority. In particular, it can accurately evaluate the average response time for each class of emergency calls individually, paying particular attention to high priority calls. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB Environmental strains are causing consumers to trade up to greener alternatives and many brown products are losing market coverage to premium-priced green rivals. In order to tackle this threat, many companies currently offering only brown products are contemplating the launch of a green product to complement their product portfolio. This paper provides strategic insights into and tactical ramifications of expanding a brown product line with a new green product. Our analysis explicitly incorporates a segmented consumer market where individual consumers may value the same product differently, the economies of scale and the learning effects associated with new green products, and capacity constraints for the current production system. It is shown that a single pricing scheme for the new green product limits a firm's ability to appropriate the value different customers will relinquish in a segmented market and/or to avoid cannibalization. A two-level pricing structure can diminish and even completely avoid the salience of cannibalization. However, when resources are scarce, a firm can never protect his products from the threat of cannibalization by just revising the pricing structure which can spell the end of his brown product's presence in the market or preclude the firm from launching the green product. At this point, the degree of cannibalization is higher for the brown product when the green product offers a sufficiently differentiated proposition to green segment consumers. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB The world faces major problems, not least climate change and the financial crisis, and business schools have been criticised for their failure to help address these issues and, in the case of the financial meltdown, for being causally implicated in it. In this paper we begin by describing the extent of what has been called the rigour/relevance debate. We then diagnose the nature of the problem in terms of historical, structural and contextual mechanisms that initiated and now sustain an inability of business schools to engage with real-world issues. We then propose a combination of measures, which mutually reinforce each other, that are necessary to break into this vicious circle - critical realism as an underpinning philosophy that supports and embodies the next points; holism and transdisciplinarity; multimethodology (mixed-methods research); and a critical and ethical-committed stance. OR and management science have much to contribute in terms of both powerful analytical methods and problem structuring methods. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Limiting ourselves to the traditional mean-variance portfolio setting, we test in a simple backtesting setup whether these efficiency measures fare any better than more traditional financial performance measures in selecting promising investment opportunities. The evidence points to a remarkable superior performance of these frontier models compared to most, but not all traditional financial performance measures. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB U-shaped assembly lines are an important configuration of modern manufacturing systems due to their flexibility to adapt to varying market demands. In U-shaped lines, tasks are assigned after their predecessors or successors. Some MILP models have been proposed to formulate the U-shaped assembly line balancing problem using either-or constraints to express precedence relationships. We show that this modeling approach reported in the literature may often find optimal solutions that are infeasible and verify this on a large set of benchmark problems. We present a revision to this model to accurately express the precedence relationships without introducing additional variables or constraints. We also illustrate on the same benchmark problems that our revision always reports solutions that are feasible. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The growing attention and prominence afforded to analytics presents a genuine challenge for the operational research community. Many in the community have recognised this growth and sought to align themselves with analytics. For instance, the US operational research society INFORMS now offers analytics related conferences, certification and a magazine. However, as shown in this research, the volume of analytics-orientated studies in journals associated with operational research is comparatively low. This paper seeks to address this paradox by seeking to better understand what analytics is, and how operational research is related to it. To do so literature from a range of academic disciplines is analysed, in what is conceived as concurrent histories in the shared tradition of a management paradigm spread over the last 100 years. The findings of this analysis reveal new insights as to how operational research exists within an ecosystem shared with several other disciplines, and how interactions and ripple effects diffuse knowledge and ideas between each. Whilst this ecosystem is developed and evolved through interdisciplinary collaborations, individual disciplines are cast into competition for the attention of the same business users. These findings are further explored by discussing the implication this has for operational research, as well as considering what directions future research may take to maximise the potential value of these relationships.

AB The bipartite boolean quadratic programming problem (BBQP) is a generalization of the well studied boolean quadratic programming problem. The model has a variety of real life applications; however, empirical studies of the model are not available in the literature, except in a few isolated instances. In this paper, we develop efficient heuristic algorithms based on tabu search, very large scale neighborhood (VLSN) search, and a hybrid algorithm that integrates the two. The computational study establishes that effective integration of simple tabu search with VLSN search results in superior outcomes, and suggests the value of such an integration in other settings. Complexity analysis and implementation details are provided along with conclusions drawn from experimental analysis. In addition, we obtain solutions better than the best previously known for almost all medium and large size benchmark instances. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This paper examines the relation between dividend policy, managerial ownership and debt-financing for a large sample of firms listed on NYSE, AMEX and NASDAQ. In addition to standard parametric estimation methods, we use a semi-parametric approach, which helps capture more effectively non-linearities in the data. In line with the alignment effect of managerial ownership, our results support a negative relationship between managerial ownership and dividends when managerial ownership is at relatively low levels. However, this negative relationship turns into a positive one at very high levels of managerial ownership. We also find that the nature of the relationship between managerial ownership and dividends may be more complex than it has been previously thought, and it also differs significantly across firms with different levels of debt/financial constraints. The results are consistent with the view that agency theory provides useful insights but cannot fully explain how firms determine their dividend policy. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This paper develops an index for comparing the productivity of groups of operating units in cost terms when input prices are available. In that sense it represents an extension of a similar index available in the literature for comparing groups of units in terms of technical productivity in the absence of input prices. The index is decomposed to reveal the origins of differences in performance of the groups of units both in terms of technical and cost productivity. The index and its decomposition are of value in contexts where the need arises to compare units which perform the same function but they can be grouped by virtue of the fact that they operate in different contexts as might for example arise in comparisons of water or gas transmission companies operating in different countries.

ID OPTIMAL CAPITAL STRUCTURE; CONSUMPTION; MODEL
AB We consider a risk-averse entrepreneur who invests in a project with idiosyncratic risk. In contrast to the literature, we assume the entrepreneur is unable to get a loan from a bank directly because of the low creditability of the entrepreneur and so an innovative financial contract, named equity-for-guarantee swap, is signed among a bank, an insurer, and the entrepreneur. It is shown that the new swap leads to higher leverage, which brings more diversification and tax benefits. The new swap not only solves the problems of financing constraints, but also significantly improves the welfare level of the entrepreneur. The growth of welfare level increases dramatically with risk aversion index and the volatility of idiosyncratic risk. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ID DECOMPOSITION
AB In this paper, we study a multi-periodic production planning problem in agriculture. This problem belongs to the class of crop rotation planning problems, which have received considerable attention in the literature in recent years. Crop cultivation and fallow periods must be scheduled on land plots over a given time horizon so as to minimize the total surface area of land used, while satisfying crop demands every period. This problem is proven strongly NP-hard. We propose a 0-1 linear programming formulation based on crop-sequence graphs. An extended formulation is then provided with a polynomial-time pricing problem, and a Branch-and-Price-and-Cut (BPC) algorithm is presented with adapted branching rules and cutting planes. The numerical experiments on instances varying the number of crops, periods and plots show the effectiveness of the BPC for the extended formulation compared to solving the compact formulation, even though these two formulations have the same linear relaxation bound.

AB The Standard Quadratic Problem (StQP) is an NP-hard problem with many local minimizers (stationary points). In the literature, heuristics based on unconstrained continuous non-convex formulations have been proposed (Bomze & Palagi, 2005; Bomze, Grippo, & Palagi, 2012) but none dominates the other in terms of best value found. Following (Cassioli, DiLorenzo, Locatelli, Schoen, & Sciandrone, 2012) we propose to use Support Vector Machines (SVMs) to define a multistart global strategy which selects the "best" heuristic. We test our method on StQP arising from the Maximum Clique Problem on a graph which is a challenging combinatorial problem. We use as benchmark the clique problems in the DIMACS challenge.

AB A VNS-based heuristic using both a facility as well as a customer type neighbourhood structure is proposed to solve the p-centre problem in the continuous space. Simple but effective enhancements to the original Elzinga-Hearn algorithm as well as a powerful 'locate-allocate' local search used within VNS are proposed. In addition, efficient implementations in both neighbourhood structures are presented. A learning scheme is also embedded into the search to produce a new variant of VNS that uses memory. The effect of incorporating strong intensification within the local search via a VND type structure is also explored with interesting results. Empirical results, based on several existing data set (TSP-Lib) with various values of p, show that the proposed VNS implementations outperform both a multi-start heuristic and the discrete-based optimal approach that use the same local search.

AB Facility dispersion problems involve placing a number of facilities as far apart from each other as possible. Four different criteria of facility dispersal have been proposed in the literature (Erkut & Neuman, 1991). Despite their formal differences, these four classic dispersion objectives can be expressed in a unified model called the partial-sum dispersion model (Lei & Church, 2013). In this paper, we focus on the unweighted partial sum dispersion problem and introduce an efficient formulation for this generalized dispersion problem based on a construct by Ogryczak and Tamir (2003). We also present a fast branch-and-bound based exact algorithm. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In the vertical alignment phase of road design, one minimizes the cost of moving material between different sections of the road while maintaining safety and building code constraints. Existing vertical alignment models consider neither the side-slopes of the road nor the natural blocks like rivers, mountains, etc., in the construction area. The calculated cost without the side-slopes can have significant errors (more than 20 percent), and the earthwork schedule without considering the blocks is unrealistic. In this study, we present a novel mixed integer linear programming model for the vertical alignment problem that considers both of these issues. The numerical results show that the approximation of the side-slopes can generate solutions within an acceptable error margin specified by the user without increasing the time complexity significantly.

AB We consider a family of composite bivariate distributions, or probability mass functions (pmfs), with uniform marginals for simulating optimization-problem instances. For every possible population correlation, except the extreme values, there are an infinite number of valid joint distributions in this family. We quantify the entropy for all member distributions, including the special cases under independence and both extreme correlations. Greater variety is expected across optimization-problem instances simulated based on a high-entropy pmf. We present a closed-form solution to the problem of finding the joint pmf that maximizes entropy for a specified population correlation, and we show that this entropy-maximizing pmf belongs to our family of pmfs. We introduce the entropy range as a secondary indicator of the variety of instances that may be generated for a particular correlation. Finally, we discuss how to systematically control entropy and correlation to simulate a set of synthetic problem instances that includes challenging examples and examples with realistic characteristics.

The objective is to minimize the completion time of the last accepted job plus the total penalty of all rejected jobs. The scheduling problem is known to be NP-hard in the strong sense. We find some new optimal properties and develop an O(n log n + n/is an element of) heuristic to solve the problem with a worst-case bound of 1.5 + is an element of, where is an element of > 0 can be any small given constant. This improves upon the worst-case bound 2 - 1/m, of the heuristic presented by Bartal et al. (Bartal, Y., Leonardi, S., Marchetti-Spaccamela, A., Sgall, J., & Stougie, L (2000).

AB The rectangle packing area minimization problem is a key sub-problem of floorplanning in VLSI design. This problem places a set of axis aligned two-dimensional rectangular items of given sizes onto a rectangular plane such that no two items overlap and the area of the enveloping rectangle is minimized. This paper presents a dynamic reduction algorithm that transforms an instance of the original problem to a series of instances of the rectangle packing problem by dynamically determining the dimensions of the enveloping rectangle. We define an injury degree to evaluate the possible negative impact for candidate placements, and we propose a least injury first approach for solving the rectangle packing problem. Next, we incorporate a compacting approach to compact the resulting layout by alternatively moving the items left and down toward a bottom-left corner such that we may obtain a smaller enveloping rectangle. We also show the feasibility, compactness, non-inferiority, and halting properties of the compacting approach. Comprehensive experiments were conducted on 11 MCNC and GSRC benchmarks and 28 instances reported in the literature. The experimental results show the high efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed dynamic reduction algorithm, especially on large-scale instances with hundreds of items.

DE Combinatorial optimisation; Linear ordering problem; Local optima;

ID BOUND ALGORITHM; SEARCH; TOURNAMENTS
AB The Linear Ordering Problem is a popular combinatorial optimisation problem which has been extensively addressed in the literature. However, in spite of its popularity, little is known about the characteristics of this problem. This paper studies a procedure to extract static information from an instance of the problem, and proposes a method to incorporate the obtained knowledge in order to improve the performance of local search-based algorithms. The procedure introduced identifies the positions where the indexes cannot generate local optima for the insert neighbourhood, and thus global optima solutions. This information is then used to propose a restricted insert neighbourhood that discards the insert operations which move indexes to positions where optimal solutions are not generated.
   In order to measure the efficiency of the proposed restricted insert neighbourhood system, two state-of-the-art algorithms for the LOP that include local search procedures have been modified. Conducted experiments confirm that the restricted versions of the algorithms outperform the classical designs systematically when a maximum number of function evaluations is considered as the stopping criterion. The statistical test included in the experimentation reports significant differences in all the cases, which validates the efficiency of our proposal. Moreover, additional experiments comparing the execution times reveal that the restricted approaches are faster than their counterparts for most of the instances. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB Working environment affects human health condition and performance. Human Factors (HF) scholars aim to elaborate this effect. However, HF studies mostly focus on employee occupational health and safety elements and their consequences on employee health conditions. They do not take into account Work-related El Health (WIH) risk factor effects at the system level. In contrast, operations research studies usually assume that operators involved in a system have identical performances and rarely consider WIH risk factor effects in optimizing system performance. This paper proposes a 2-state Markov chain model to quantify WIH risk factor effects and thereby estimate their economic impacts in optimizing a serial assembly line's performance. Results of this research demonstrate between 0.52 percent and 8 percent increase for the total cost of the system as WIH risk levels change. This paper opens a new window to understand economic consequences of WIH effects, and to enhance systems performance by investigating working conditions.

AB In this paper we analyze a situation in which several firms deal with inventory problems concerning the same type of product. We consider that each firm uses its limited capacity warehouse for storing purposes and that it faces an economic order quantity model where storage costs are irrelevant (and assumed to be zero) and shortages are allowed. In this setting, we show that firms can save costs by placing joint orders and obtain an optimal order policy for the firms. Besides, we identify an associated class of costs games which we show to be concave. Finally, we introduce and study a rule to share the costs among the firms which provides core allocations and can be easily computed. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The classical multi-level capacitated lot-sizing problem formulation is often not suitable to correctly capture resource requirements and precedence relations. Depending on lead time assumptions, either the model provides infeasible production plans or plans with costly needless inventory. We tackle this issue by explicitly modeling these two aspects and the synchronization of batches of products in the multi-level lot-sizing and scheduling formulation. Two models are presented; one considering batch production and the other one allowing lot-streaming. Comparisons with traditional models demonstrate the capability of the new approach in delivering more realistic results. The generated production plans are always feasible and cost savings of 30-40 percent compared to classical models are observed. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The study addresses a distributor's delivery strategy problem with consideration of carbon emissions, retailers' time-dependent demands and demand-supply interactions. A mathematical programming model is formulated for solving optimal number and time-window of service cycles. A case study is presented. The results show that the distributor would adopt a frequent delivery strategy if carbon taxes are insufficiently high. Providing the retailers with price discounts does not work out since retailers would value the delays in receiving their ordered products more than the compensations of less frequent delivery given by the distributor in response to carbon taxes. Models with demand-supply interactions can result in larger profit and market share than those without demand-supply interactions. This study sheds new light to the distributors, the retailers, and the regulators in greening the logistics transport. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This paper analyzes three major asymmetries in stock markets, namely, asymmetry in return reversals, asymmetry in return persistency and asymmetry in return volatilities. It argues for a case of return persistency as stock returns do not always reverse, in theory and in practice. Patterns in return-volatility asymmetries are conjectured and investigated jointly, under different stock market conditions. Results from modeling the world's major stock return indexes render support to the propositions of the paper. Return reversal asymmetry is illusionary arising from ambiguous parameter estimations and deluding interpretations of parameter signs. Asymmetry in return persistency, still weak though, is more prevalent. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Forest fires can impose substantial social, environmental and economic burdens on the communities on which they impact. Well managed and timely fire suppression can demonstrably reduce the area burnt and minimise consequent losses. In order to effectively coordinate emergency vehicles for fire suppression, it is important to have an understanding of the time that elapses between vehicle dispatch and arrival at a fire. Forest fires can occur in remote locations that are not necessarily directly accessible by road. Consequently estimations of vehicular travel time may need to consider both on and off road travel. We introduce and demonstrate a novel framework for estimating travel times and determining optimal travel routes for vehicles travelling from bases to forest fires where both on and off road travel may be necessary. A grid based, cost-distance approach was utilised, where a travel time surface was computed indicating travel time from the reported fire location. Times were calculated using a discrete event simulation cellular automata (CA) model, with the CA progressing outwards from the fire location. Optimal fastest travel paths were computed by recognising chains of parent-child relationships. Our results achieved comparable results to traditional network analysis techniques when considering travel along roads; however the method was also demonstrated to be effective in estimating travel times and optimal routes in complex terrain.

In this context we show that if we are willing to enforce the coherent or distortion axioms only on random variables that are affine or linear functions of the vector of random parameters, we may consider some new variants of the uncertainty sets determined by the classical characterizations. We also show that in the finite probability case these variants are simple transformations of the classical sets. Finally we present results of computational experiments that suggest that the risk measures associated with these new uncertainty sets can help mitigate estimation errors of the Conditional Value-at-Risk.

ID AGGREGATION; CLASSIFICATION
AB In this paper the notion of restricted dissimilarity function is discussed and some general results are shown. The relation between the concepts of restricted dissimilarity function and penalty function is presented. A specific model of construction of penalty functions by means of a wide class of restricted dissimilarity functions based upon automorphisms of the unit interval is studied. A characterization theorem of the automorphisms which give rise to two-dimensional penalty functions is proposed. A generalization of the previous theorem to any dimension n > 2 is also provided. Finally, a not convex example of generator of penalty functions of arbitrary dimension is illustrated. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

   EXPECTED VALUE; QFD; MODELS; AGGREGATION
AB Quality function deployment (QFD) is one of the very effective customer-driven quality system tools typically applied to fulfill customer needs or requirements (CRs). It is a crucial step in QFD to derive the prioritization of design requirements (DRs) from CRs for a product. However, effective prioritization of DRs is seriously challenged due to two types of uncertainties: human subjective perception and customer heterogeneity. This paper tries to propose a novel two-stage group decision-making approach to simultaneously address the two types of uncertainties underlying QFD. The first stage is to determine the fuzzy preference relations of different DRs with respect to each customer based on the order-based semantics of linguistic information. The second stage is to determine the prioritization of DRs by synthesizing all customers' fuzzy preference relations into an overall one by fuzzy majority. Two examples, a Chinese restaurant and a flexible manufacturing system, are used to illustrate the proposed approach. The restaurant example is also used to compare with three existing approaches. Implementation results show that the proposed approach can eliminate the burden of quantifying qualitative concepts and model customer heterogeneity and design team's preference. Due to its easiness, our approach can reduce the cognitive burden of QFD planning team and give a practical convenience in QFD planning. Extensions to the proposed approach are also given to address application contexts involving a wider set of HOQ elements. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB We introduce a new preference disaggregation modeling formulations for multiple criteria sorting with a set of additive value functions. The preference information supplied by the Decision Maker (DM) is composed of: (1) possibly imprecise assignment examples, (2) desired class cardinalities, and (3) assignment-based pairwise comparisons. The latter have the form of imprecise statements referring to the desired assignments for pairs of alternatives, but without specifying any concrete class. Additionally, we account for preferences concerning the shape of the marginal value functions and desired comprehensive values of alternatives assigned to a given class or class range. The exploitation of all value functions compatible with these preferences results in three types of results: (1) necessary and possible assignments, (2) extreme class cardinalities, and (3) necessary and possible assignment-based preference relations. These outputs correspond to different types of admitted preference information. By exhibiting different outcomes, we encourage the DM in various ways to enrich her/his preference information interactively. The applicability of the framework is demonstrated on data involving the classification of cities into liveability classes. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In a bankruptcy situation individuals are not equally affected since each one has its own specific characteristics. These aspects cannot be ignored and may justify an allocation bias in favor of or against some individuals. This paper develops a theory of differentiation in claims problems that considers not only the vector of claims, but also some justified differentiating criteria based on other characteristics (wealth, net-income, GDP, etc.). Accordingly, we propose some progressive transfers from richer to poorer claimants with the purpose of distributing the damage as evenly as possible. Finally, we characterize our solution by means of the Lorenz criterion. Endogenous convex combinations between solutions are also considered. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Economic assessment of energy-related processes needs to adapt to the development of large-scale integration of renewable energies into the energy system. Flexible electrochemical processes, such as the electrolysis of water to produce hydrogen, are foreseen as cornerstones to renewable energy systems. These types of technologies require the current methods of energy storage scheduling and capacity planning to incorporate their distinct non-linear characteristics in order to be able to fully assess their economic impact. A combined scheduling and capacity planning model for an innovative, flexible electricity-to-hydrogen-to-ammonia plant is derived in this paper. A heuristic is presented, which is able to translate the depicted, non-convex and mixed-integer problem into a set of convex and continuous non-linear problems. These can be solved with commercially available solvers. The global optimum of the original problem is encircled by the heuristic, and, as the numerical illustration with German electricity market data of 2013 shows, can be narrowed down and approximated very well. The results show, that it is not only meaningfulness, but also feasible to solve a combined scheduling and capacity problem on a convex non-linear basis for this and similar new process concepts. Application to other hydrogen based concepts is straightforward and to other, non-linear chemical processes generally possible. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

DE Applied probability; Probability sampling; Rare events; Profiling
ID PARTITION; SYSTEM
AB Frequently one has to search within a finite population for a single particular individual or item with a rare characteristic. Whether an item possesses the characteristic can only be determined by close inspection. The availability of additional information about the items in the population opens the way to a more effective search strategy than just random sampling or complete inspection of the population. We will assume that the available information allows for the assignment to all items within the population of a prior probability on whether or not it possesses the rare characteristic. This is consistent with the practice of using profiling to select high risk items for inspection. The objective is to find the specific item with the minimum number of inspections. We will determine the optimal search strategies for several models according to the average number of inspections needed to find the specific item. Using these respective optimal strategies we show that we can order the numbers of inspections needed for the different models partially with respect to the usual stochastic ordering. This entails also a partial ordering of the averages of the number of inspections.
   Finally, the use, some discussion, extensions, and examples of these results, and conclusions about them are presented. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Studies have widely used stochastic frontier models to assess financial efficiency; however, traditional static approaches do not take dynamic characteristics of financial systems into account. This article develops a dynamic stochastic frontier model to evaluate regional financial efficiency and provides an empirical test of the model by using panel data of 62 Chinese counties during the 2001-2010 period. The model measures the dynamic impact of the input-output variables and environmental variables on financial efficiency, and allows for the separation of technical change from the change in technical efficiency. The results show that the dynamic model provides a better fit to the data than the static model. In addition, a gradient difference emerges in the regional financial efficiency among the six major regions of China. The results offer practical implications for the development of regional financial services in China, as well as other developing countries and emerging economies. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB Packaging links the entire supply chain and coordinates all participants in the process to give a flexible and effective response to customer needs in order to maximize satisfaction at optimal cost. This research proposes an optimization model to define the minimum total cost combination of outer packs in various distribution channels with the least opening ratio (the percentage of total orders requiring the opening of an outer pack to exactly meet the demand). A simple routine to define a feasible start point is proposed to reduce the complexity caused by the number of possible combinations. A Fast-Moving Consumer Goods company in an emerging economy (Colombia) is analyzed to test the proposed methodology. The main findings are useful for emerging markets in that they provide significant savings in the whole supply chain and insights into the packaging problem. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB Despite linear programming and duality have correctly been incorporated in algorithms to compute the nucleolus, we have found mistakes in how these have been used in a broad range of applications. Overlooking the fact that a linear program can have multiple optimal solutions and neglecting the relevance of duality appear to be crucial sources of mistakes in computing the nucleolus. We discuss these issues and illustrate them in five mistaken examples from this and other journals. The purpose of this note is to prevent these mistakes propagate longer by clarifying how linear programming and duality can be correctly used for computing the nucleolus. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

The timetable is designed by choosing the time of service for customer unit train demands among a set of discrete points. These discrete points are all found within the a time-window. The objective of the model is to minimize cost while adhering to constraints regarding infrastructure usage, demand coverage, and engine availability. The model is solved by a column generation scheme where feasible engine schedules are designed in a label setting algorithm with time-dependent cost and service times. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF OPERATIONAL RESEARCH

DT Article
DE Move evaluation; Local search; Job-shop; Makespan; Scheduling
ID ALGORITHM
AB This article focuses on the evaluation of moves for the local search of the job-shop problem with the makespan criterion. We reason that the omnipresent ranking of moves according to their resulting value of a criterion function makes the local search unnecessarily myopic. Consequently, we introduce an alternative evaluation that relies on a surrogate quantity of the move's potential, which is related to, but not strongly coupled with, the bare criterion. The approach is confirmed by empirical tests, where the proposed evaluator delivers a new upper bound on the well-known benchmark test yn2. The line of the argumentation also shows that by sacrificing accuracy the established makespan estimators unintentionally improve on the move evaluation in comparison to the exact makespan calculation, in contrast to the belief that the reliance on estimation degrades the optimization results.

AB Recently, it has been pointed out that transport models should reflect all significant traveler choice behavior. In particular, trip generation, trip distribution, modal split as well as route choice should be modeled in a consistent process based on the equilibrium between transport supply and travel demand. In this paper a general fixed-point approach that allows dealing with multi-user stochastic equilibrium assignment with variable demand is presented. The main focus was on investigating the effectiveness of internal and external approaches and of different algorithmic specifications based on the method of successive averages within the internal approach. The vector demand function was assumed non-separable, non-symmetric cost functions were adopted and implementation issues, such updating step and convergence criterion, were investigated. In particular the aim was threefold: (i) compare the internal and the external approaches; (ii) investigate the effectiveness of different algorithmic specifications to solve the variable demand equilibrium assignment problem through the internal approach: (iii) investigate the incidence of the number of the links with nonseparable and/or asymmetrical cost functions. The proposed analyses were carried out with respect to two real-scale urban networks regarding medium-size urban contexts in Italy. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This study examines the supply chain demand collaboration between a manufacturer and a retailer. We study how the timing of collaboration facilitates production decision of the manufacturer when the information exchanged in the collaboration is asymmetric. We investigate two collaboration mechanisms: 'Too Little' and 'Too Late', depending on the timing of information sharing between the manufacturer and the retailer. Our research results indicate that early collaboration as in the 'Too Little' mechanism leads to a stable production schedule, which decreases the need of production adjustment when production cost information becomes available; whereas a late collaboration as in the 'Too late' mechanism enhances the flexibility of production adjustment when demand information warrants it. In addition, the asymmetric demand information confounds production decisions all the time; the manufacturer has to provide proper incentives to ensure truthful information sharing in collaboration. Information asymmetry might also reduce the difference in production decision between the 'Too Little' and 'Too Late' collaboration mechanisms. Numerical analysis is further conducted to demonstrate the performance implications of the collaboration mechanisms on the supply chain. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB In this paper we consider a single-item inventory system with lost sales and fixed order cost. We numerically illustrate the lack of a clear structure in optimal replenishment policies for such systems. However, policies with a simple structure are preferred in practical settings. Examples of replenishment policies with a simple parametric description are the (s, S) policy and the (s, nQ) policy. Besides these known policies in literature, we propose a new type of replenishment policy. In our modified (s. 5) policy we restrict the order size of the standard (s, S) policy to a maximum. This policy results in near-optimal costs. Furthermore, we derive heuristic procedures to set the inventory control parameters for this new replenishment policy. In our first approach we formulate closed-form expressions based on power approximations, whereas in our second approach we derive an approximation for the steady-state inventory distribution. As a result, the latter approach could be used for inventory systems with different objectives or service level constraints. The numerical experiments illustrate that the heuristic procedures result on average in 2.4 percent and 1.8 percent cost increases, respectively, compared to the optimal replenishment policy. Therefore, we conclude that the heuristic procedures are very effective to set the inventory control parameters. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The use of Markov Decision Processes for Inspection Maintenance and Rehabilitation of civil engineering structures relies on the use of several transition matrices related to the stochastic degradation process, maintenance actions and imperfect inspections. Point estimators for these matrices are usually used and they are evaluated using statistical inference methods and/or expert evaluation methods. Thus, considerable epistemic uncertainty often veils the true values of these matrices. Our contribution through this paper is threefold. First, we present a methodology for incorporating epistemic uncertainties in dynamic programming algorithms used to solve finite horizon Markov Decision Processes (which may be partially observable). Second, we propose a methodology based on the use of Dirichlet distributions which answers, in our sense, much of the controversy found in the literature about estimating Markov transition matrices. Third, we show how the complexity resulting from the use of Monte-Carlo simulations for the transition matrices can be greatly overcome in the framework of dynamic programming. The proposed model is applied to concrete bridge under degradation, in order to provide the optimal strategy for inspection and maintenance. The influence of epistemic uncertainties on the optimal solution is underlined through sensitivity analysis regarding the input data. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In the case of standby redundancy, we present some interesting comparison results of both series systems and parallel systems in the sense of various stochastic orderings for both the matching spares case and non-matching spares case, respectively. In the case of active redundancy, a likelihood ratio ordering result of series systems is presented for the matching spares case; and for the non-matching spares case, a counterexample is provided to show that there does not exist similar result even for the hazard rate ordering. The results established here strengthen and generalize some of those known in the literature. Some numerical examples are also provided to illustrate the theoretical results. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB To assess a product's reliability for subsequent managerial decisions such as designing an extended warranty policy and developing a maintenance schedule, Accelerated Degradation Test (ADT) has been used to obtain reliability information in a timely manner. In particular, Step-Stress ADT(SSADT) is one of the most commonly used stress loadings for shortening test duration and reducing the required sample size. Although it was demonstrated in many previous studies that the optimum SSADT plan is actually a simple SSADT plan using only two stress levels, most of these results were obtained numerically on a case-by-case basis. In this paper, we formally prove that, under the Wiener degradation model with a drift parameter being a linear function of the (transformed) stress level, a multi-level SSADT plan will degenerate to a simple SSADT plan under many commonly used optimization criteria and some practical constraints. We also show that, under our model assumptions, any SSADT plan with more than two distinct stress levels cannot be optimal. These results are useful for searching for an optimum SSADT plan, since one needs to focus only on simple SSADTs. A numerical example is presented to compare the efficiency of the proposed optimum simple SSADT plans and a SSADT plan proposed by a previous study. In addition, a simulation study is conducted for investigating the efficiency of the proposed SSADT plans when the sample size is small. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB We propose a profit maximization model for the decision support system of a firm that wishes to establish or rationalize a multinational manufacturing and distribution network to produce and deliver finished goods from sources to consumers. The model simultaneously evaluates all traditional location factors in a manufacturing and distribution network design problem and sets intra-firm transfer prices that take account of tax and exchange rate differentials between countries. Utilizing the generalized Benders decomposition approach, we exploit the partition between the product flow and the cash allocation (i.e., the pricing and revenue assignment) decisions in the supply chain to find near optimal model solutions. Our proposed profit maximizing strategic planning model produces intuitive results. We offer computational experiments to illustrate the potential valuable guidance the model can provide to a firm's supply chain design strategic planning process. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Separate covariate sets may be used in the mixture components. The selection criteria are applicable to survival models for right-censored data with multiple competing risks and allow for the presence of a non-susceptible group. The method is illustrated on credit loan data, with pre-payment and default as events and maturity as the non-susceptible case and is used in a simulation study. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB In this paper, we address the impact of uncertainty introduced when the experts complete pairwise comparison matrices, in the context of multi-criteria decision making. We first discuss how uncertainty can be quantified and modeled and then show how the probability of rank reversal scales with the number of experts. We consider the impact of various aspects which may affect the estimation of probability of rank reversal in the context of pairwise comparisons, such as the uncertainty level, alternative preference scales and different weight estimation methods. We also consider the case where the comparisons are carried out in a fuzzy manner. It is shown that in most circumstances, augmenting the size of the expert group beyond 15 produces a small change in the probability of rank reversal. We next address the issue of how this probability can be estimated in practice, from information gathered simply from the comparison matrices of a single expert group. We propose and validate a scheme which yields an estimate for the probability of rank reversal and test the applicability of this scheme under various conditions. The framework discussed in the paper can allow decision makers to correctly choose the number of experts participating in a pairwise comparison and obtain an estimate of the credibility of the outcome.

AB The theory of aggregation most often deals with measures of central tendency. However, sometimes a very different kind of a numeric vector's synthesis into a single number is required. In this paper we introduce a class of mathematical functions which aim to measure spread or scatter of one-dimensional quantitative data. The proposed definition serves as a common, abstract framework for measures of absolute spread known from statistics, exploratory data analysis and data mining, e.g. the sample variance, standard deviation, range, interquartile range (IQR), median absolute deviation (MAD), etc. Additionally, we develop new measures of experts' opinions diversity or consensus in group decision making problems. We investigate some properties of spread measures, show how are they related to aggregation functions, and indicate their new potentially fruitful application areas. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB Traveling salesman problem is a fundamental combinatorial optimization model studied in the operations research community for nearly half a century, yet there is surprisingly little literature that addresses uncertainty and multiple objectives in it. A novel TSP variation, called uncertain multiobjective TSP (UMTSP) with uncertain variables on the arc, is proposed in this paper on the basis of uncertainty theory, and a new solution approach named uncertain approach is applied to obtain Pareto efficient route in UMTSP. Considering the uncertain and combinatorial nature of UMTSP, a new ABC algorithm inserted with reverse operator, crossover operator and mutation operator is designed to this problem, which outperforms other algorithms through the performance comparison on three benchmark TSPs. Finally, a new benchmark UMTSP case study is presented to illustrate the construction and solution of UMTSP, which shows that the optimal route in deterministic TSP can be a poor route in UMTSP.

AB Dynamic pricing has become a common form of electricity tariff, where the price of electricity varies in real time based on the realized electricity supply and demand. Hence, optimizing industrial operations to benefit from periods with low electricity prices is vital to maximizing the benefits of dynamic pricing. In the case of water networks, energy consumed by pumping is a substantial cost for water utilities, and optimizing pump schedules to accommodate for the changing price of energy while ensuring a continuous supply of water is essential. In this paper, a Mixed-Integer Non-linear Programming (MINLP) formulation of the optimal pump scheduling problem is presented. Due to the non-linearities, the typical size of water networks, and the discretization of the planning horizon, the problem is not solvable within reasonable time using standard optimization software. We present a Lagrangian decomposition approach that exploits the structure of the problem leading to smaller problems that are solved independently. The Lagrangian decomposition is coupled with a simulation-based, improved limited discrepancy search algorithm that is capable of finding high quality feasible solutions. The proposed approach finds solutions with guaranteed upper and lower bounds. These solutions are compared to those found by a mixed-integer linear programming approach, which uses a piecewise-linearization of the non-linear constraints to find a global optimal solution of the relaxation. Numerical testing is conducted on two real water networks and the results illustrate the significant costs savings due to optimizing pump schedules. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This paper first introduces an original trajectory model using B-splines and a new semi-infinite programming formulation of the separation constraint involved in air traffic conflict problems. A new continuous optimization formulation of the tactical conflict-resolution problem is then proposed. It involves very few optimization variables in that one needs only one optimization variable to determine each aircraft trajectory. Encouraging numerical experiments show that this approach is viable on realistic test problems. Not only does one not need to rely on the traditional, discretized, combinatorial optimization approaches to this problem, but, moreover, local continuous optimization methods, which require relatively fewer iterations and thereby fewer costly function evaluations, are shown to improve the performance of the overall global optimization of this non-convex problem.

AB We introduce debt issuance limit constraints along with market debt and bank debt to consider how financial frictions affect investment, financing, and debt structure strategies. Our model provides four important results. First, a firm is more likely to issue market debt than bank debt when its debt issuance limit increases. Second, investment strategies are nonmonotonic with respect to debt issuance limits. Third, debt issuance limits distort the relationship between a firm's equity value and investment strategy. Finally, debt issuance limit constraints lead to debt holders experiencing low risk and low returns. That is, the more severe the debt issuance limits are, the lower are the credit spreads and default probabilities. Our theoretical results are consistent with stylized facts and empirical results.

AB This paper develops primal and dual versions of the dynamic Luenberger productivity growth measures that are based on the dynamic directional distance function and intertemporal cost minimization, respectively. The empirical application focuses on panel data of Dutch dairy farms over the period 1995-2005. Primal dynamic Luenberger productivity growth averages 1.5 percent annually in the period under investigation, with technical change being the main driver of annual change. Dual dynamic Luenberger productivity growth is -0.1 percent in the same period. Improvements in technical inefficiency and technical change are partly counteracted by deteriorations of allocative inefficiency, with large dairy farms presenting a slightly higher productivity growth than small dairy farms.

   Performance bounds
AB We test the lower bound for a static remanufacturing system with returns proposed by Feng and Viswanathan (2014) against two heuristics proposed by Choi et al. (2007) and Schulz and Voigt (2014). A numerical study with 81,000 instances concludes that the lower bound always holds for the Choi et al. (2007) heuristic, but does not hold for 45 percent of all tested instances compared to the Schulz and Voigt (2014) heuristic. In these 45 percent, the average deviation from the lower bound is 4 percent with a maximum deviation of 14.9 percent. The main difference between the two analyzed heuristics is that the Choi et al. heuristic applies equally sized manufacturing and remanufacturing batches (which is also assumed to hold in the proposed lower bound), while Schulz and Voigt present a heuristic in which the respective remanufacturing batch sizes may vary. In contrast to Feng and Viswanathan (2014), we conclude that management should be cautious to use too simple policy structures when obtaining a solution for a static remanufacturing system with product returns.

AB Parameter estimation based on uncertain data represented as belief structures is one of the latest problems in the Dempster-Shafer theory. In this paper, a novel method is proposed for the parameter estimation in the case where belief structures are uncertain and represented as interval-valued belief structures. Within our proposed method, the maximization of likelihood criterion and minimization of estimated parameter's uncertainty are taken into consideration simultaneously. As an illustration, the proposed method is employed to estimate parameters for deterministic and uncertain belief structures, which demonstrates its effectiveness and versatility.

AB Today, an increasing number of companies have publicized policies to improve corporate social responsibility performance related to human resources in their supply chain management practices, such as safer and healthier working conditions, higher payment, better benefits, and fewer working hours. However, there are still concerns about the sincerity and effectiveness of such efforts. This could be attributed to the fact that the economic benefit of those improvements is not clearly structured as an integral part in the companies' decision-making process. In this paper, we develop a stylized analytic framework that links a firm's supply chain social performance in people with its economic performance in profit. Specifically, we examine how consumers' responses to the outbreak of social misconduct in supply chains affect competing firms' market segmentation and profit and subsequently provide economic incentive for proactive social responsibility investment. Closed-form optimal solutions for proactive social responsibility strategy are found for our model setup. Numerical tests and sensitivity analyses have been conducted to study the effects of various factors on the firms' supply chain social responsibility strategies. Factors such as consumers' ethical disposition, the social environment, and consumers' perception of a product's functional versus social value are a few among them. The results of our analysis demonstrate that proactive investment in supply chain social responsibility can enhance a firm's competitive advantage and economic performance, thereby suggesting a profit-driven approach to achieving supply chain social responsibility and sustainability.

AB With the rapid development of Web 2.0 applications, social media have increasingly become a major factor influencing the purchase decisions of customers. Longitudinal individual and engagement behavioral data generated on social media sites post challenges to integrate diverse heterogeneous data to improve prediction performance in customer response modeling. In this study, a hierarchical ensemble learning framework is proposed for behavior-aware user response modeling using diverse heterogeneous data. In the framework, a general-purpose data transformation and feature extraction strategy is developed to transform the heterogeneous high-dimensional multi-relational datasets into customer-centered high-order tensors and to extract attributes. An improved hierarchical multiple kernel support vector machine (H-MK-SVM) is developed to integrate the external, tag and keyword, individual behavioral and engagement behavioral data for feature selection from multiple correlated attributes and for ensemble learning in user response modeling. The subagging strategy is adopted to deal with large-scale imbalanced datasets. Computational experiments using a real-world microblog database were conducted to investigate the benefits of integrating diverse heterogeneous data. Computational results show that the improved H-MK-SVM using longitudinal individual behavioral data exhibits superior performance over some commonly used methods using aggregated behavioral data and the improved H-MK-SVM using engagement behavioral data performs better than using only the external and individual behavioral data.

AB This paper sheds new light on the relationship between inputs and outputs in the framework of the educational production function. In particular, it is geared at gaining a better understanding of which factors may be affected in order to achieve an optimal educational output level. With this objective in mind, we analyze teacher-based assessments (actual marks) in three different subjects using a multiobjective schema. For much of the analysis we use data from a recent (2010) Survey - ESOC10, linked with the results from an educational assessment program conducted among 11 and 15 year-old students and with the administrative records on teacher-based scores. Following the statistical and econometric analysis of these data, they are used to build a multiobjective mixed integer model. A reference point approach is used to determine the profile of, potentially, the most "successful and balanced" students in terms of educational outcomes. This kind of methodology in multiobjective programming allows generating "very balanced" solutions in terms of the objective values (subjects). Finally, a sensitivity analysis is used to determine policies that can be carried out in order to improve the performance levels of primary and secondary education students. Particularly, policy makers should be more concerned with the need to promote some cultural habits - such as reading -, from both the students' and parents' side. Additionally, policy efforts should be focused on making the vocational pathways available to Spanish youth more appealing, with the aim of taking advantage of the particular skills of students not succeeding in the academic track.

ID PRICE; PROMOTIONS; RETAILER; CONSUMER; MANUFACTURER; PURCHASE
AB The selection of either a pull or a push price promotion has mainly been investigated in contexts where manufacturers offer deals to consumers at the time of purchase or offer trade deals to retailers. This paper extends this framework to where manufacturers can offer either trade deals or rebate-like promotions to consumers such as on-pack coupons that stimulate the first and second purchases or a combination of the two promotion vehicles. It is demonstrated that the decision to implement either of the three promotion options critically depends, among other factors, on the percentage of first-time buyers who redeem their coupons at the second purchase. Particularly, a necessary condition to simultaneously offer both a trade deal and coupons is to have a positive coupon redemption rate. When possible, manufacturers prefer on-pack coupons over trade deals to take advantage of slippage and to further increase the overall demand via coupon-induced repeat purchase. Manufacturers are more likely to take the lion's share of channel profits. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB One of the main tasks of conjoint analysis is to identify consumer preferences about potential products or services. Accordingly, different estimation methods have been proposed to determine the corresponding relevant attributes. Most of these approaches rely on the post-processing of the estimated preferences to establish the importance of such variables. This paper presents new techniques that simultaneously identify consumer preferences and the most relevant attributes. The proposed approaches have two appealing characteristics. Firstly, they are grounded on a support vector machine formulation that has proved important predictive ability in operations management and marketing contexts and secondly they obtain a more parsimonious representation of consumer preferences than traditional models. We report the results of an extensive simulation study that shows that unlike existing methods, our approach can accurately recover the model parameters as well as the relevant attributes. Additionally, we use two conjoint choice experiments whose results show that the proposed techniques have better fit and predictive accuracy than traditional methods and that they additionally provide an improved understanding of customer preferences.

DE Integer programming; Approximation scheme; Lot-sizing; Carbon emissions
ID SUSTAINABILITY; ALGORITHMS; REDUCTION; TIME
AB We consider a generalisation of the lot-sizing problem that includes an emission capacity constraint. Besides the usual financial costs, there are emissions associated with production, keeping inventory and setting up the production process. Because the capacity constraint on the emissions can be seen as a constraint on an alternative objective function, there is also a clear link with hi-objective optimisation. We show that lot-sizing with an emission capacity constraint is NP-hard and propose several solution methods. Our algorithms are not only able to handle a fixed-plus-linear cost structure, but also more general concave cost and emission functions. First, we present a Lagrangian heuristic to provide a feasible solution and lower bound for the problem. For costs and emissions such that the zero inventory property is satisfied, we give a pseudo-polynomial algorithm, which can also be used to identify the complete set of Pareto optimal solutions of the bi-objective lot-sizing problem. Furthermore, we present a fully polynomial time approximation scheme (FPTAS) for such costs and emissions and extend it to deal with general costs and emissions. Special attention is paid to an efficient implementation with an improved rounding technique to reduce the a posteriori gap, and a combination of the FPTASes and a heuristic lower bound. Extensive computational tests show that the Lagrangian heuristic gives solutions that are very close to the optimum. Moreover, the FPTASes have a much better performance in terms of their actual gap than the a priori imposed performance, and, especially if the heuristic's lower bound is used, they are very fast.

AB Over the last years, several variants of multi-constrained Vehicle Routing Problems (VRPs) have been studied, forming a class of problems known as Rich Vehicle Routing Problems (RVRPs). The purpose of the paper is twofold: (i) to provide a comprehensive and relevant taxonomy for the RVRP literature and (ii) to propose an elaborate definition of RVRPs. To this end, selected papers addressing various cases are classified using the proposed taxonomy. Once the articles have been classified, a cluster analysis based on two discriminating criteria is performed and leads to the definition of RVRPs. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This paper focuses on the impact of consumer environmental awareness (CM) on order quantities and channel coordination within a one-manufacturer and one-retailer supply chain. The manufacturer produces two types of products; the environmental and the traditional products. These two products differ in their price and environmental quality. Based on the multi-product newsvendor model, this study compares three decision scenarios: the centralized model (M1), the decentralized model (M2), and the decentralized model with the coordination of a return contract (M3). The closed-form expressions of optimal order quantities, wholesale prices and return credits are derived for each scenario. Extending these models, we incorporate a production capacity constraint of the manufacturer. Finally, sensitivity analyses on model parameters are performed and numerical examples are provided.
   Our study suggests (1) the retailer's profit monotonically increases while the manufacturer's profit is convex with respect to CM; (2) a return contract can help both parties to achieve the profit they could expect in the centralized model; (3) order quantity of the environmental product increases with CM; (4) the production capacity constraint of the manufacturer does not impact order quantities of the two products if it is sufficiently large (when it is larger than two critical points); otherwise, production capacity constraint negatively changes the channel profit and order quantities; (5) our simulation study and sensitivity analyses indicate that the difference of environmental quality between the traditional and the environmental products determines whether order quantity of the traditional product increases or remains constant with respect to CEA. The firms will benefit from product customization and consumer segmentation based on the distribution of CM in the market. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The paper examines a method to attribute hazardous waste streams to regional production and consumption activity, and to connect these same waste streams through to different management options. We argue that a method using an input output framework provides useful intelligence for decision makers seeking to connect elements of the management of the hazardous waste hierarchy to production and to different patterns and types of final consumption (of which domestic household consumption is one). This paper extends application of conventional demand driven input output attribution methods to identify hazardous waste 'hotspots' in the supply chains of different final consumption goods and consumption groups. Using a regional case study to exposit the framework and its use, we find that domestic government final consumption of public administration production indirectly drives hazardous waste generation that goes to landfill, particularly in the domestic construction and sanitary services sectors, but also in the manufacture of wood products.

AB Green product development has become a key strategic consideration for many companies due to regulatory requirements and the public awareness of environmental protection. Life cycle assessment (LCA) is a popular tool to measure the environmental impact of new product development. Nevertheless, it is often difficult to conduct a traditional LCA at the design phase due to uncertain and/or unknown data. This research adopts the concept of LCA and introduces a comprehensive method that integrates Fuzzy Extent Analysis and Fuzzy TOPSIS for the assessment of environmental performance with respect to different product designs. Methodologically, it exhibits the superiority of the hierarchical structure and the easiness of TOPSIS implementation whilst capturing the vagueness of uncertainty. A case study concerning a consumer electronic product was presented, and data collected through a questionnaire survey were used for the design evaluation. The approach presented in this research is expected to help companies decrease development lead time by screening out poor design options. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The deterioration in profitability of listed companies not only threatens the interests of the enterprise and internal staff, but also makes investors face significant financial loss. It is important to establish an effective early warning system for prediction of financial crisis for better corporate governance. This paper studies the phenomenon of financial distress for 107 Chinese companies that received the label 'special treatment' from 2001 to 2008 by the Shanghai Stock Exchange and the Shenzhen Stock Exchange. We use data mining techniques to build financial distress warning models based on 31 financial indicators and three different time windows by comparing these 107 firms to a control group of firms. We observe that the performance of neural networks is more accurate than other classifiers, such as decision trees and support vector machines, as well as an ensemble of multiple classifiers combined using majority voting. An important contribution of the paper is to discover that financial indicators, such as net profit margin of total assets, return on total assets, earnings per share, and cash flow per share, play an important role in prediction of deterioration in profitability. This paper provides a suitable method for prediction of financial distress for listed companies in China. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The hazardous material routing problem from an origin to a destination in an urban area is addressed. We maximise the distance between the route and its closest vulnerable centre, weighted by the centre's population. A vulnerable centre is a school, hospital, senior citizens' residence or the like, concentrating a high population or one that is particularly vulnerable or difficult to evacuate in a short time. The potential consequences on the most exposed centre are thus minimized. Though previously studied in a continuous space, the problem is formulated here over a transport (road) network. We present an exact model for the problem, in which we manage to significantly reduce the required variables, as well as an optimal polynomial time heuristic. The integer programming formulation and the heuristic are tested in a real-world case study set in the transport network in the city of Santiago, Chile. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In this paper, we consider the duty scheduling of sensor activities in wireless sensor networks to maximize the lifetime. We address full target coverage problems contemplating sensors used for sensing data and transmit it to the base station through multi-hop communication as well as sensors used only for communication purposes. Subsets of sensors (also called covers) are generated. Those covers are able to satisfy the coverage requirements as well as the connection to the base station. Thus, maximum lifetime can be obtained by identifying the optimal covers and allocate them an operation time. The problem is solved through a column generation approach decomposed in a master problem used to allocate the optimal time interval during which covers are used and in a pricing subproblem used to identify the covers leading to maximum lifetime. Additionally, Branch-and-Cut based on Benders' decomposition and constraint programming approaches are used to solve the pricing subproblem. The approach is tested on randomly generated instances. The computational results demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed approach to solve the maximum network lifetime problem in wireless sensor networks with up to 500 sensors. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

ID 3-DIMENSIONAL BIN-PACKING; ALGORITHM; SEARCH
AB In the multiple container loading cost minimization problem (MCLCMP), rectangular boxes of various dimensions are loaded into rectangular containers of various sizes so as to minimize the total shipping cost. The MCLCMP can be naturally modeled as a set cover problem. We generalize the set cover formulation by introducing a new parameter to model the gross volume utilization of containers in a solution. The state-of-the-art algorithm tackles the MCLCMP using the prototype column generation (PCG) technique. PCG is an effective technique for speeding up the column generation technique for extremely hard optimization problems where their corresponding pricing subproblems are NP-hard. We propose a new approach to the MCLCMP that combines the PCG technique with a goal-driven search. Our goal-driven prototype column generation (GD-PCG) algorithm improves the original PCG approach in three respects. Computational experiments suggest that all three enhancements are effective. Our GD-PCG algorithm produces significantly better solutions for the 350 existing benchmark instances than all other approaches in the literature using less computation time. We also generate two new set instances based on industrial data and the classical single container loading instances. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Preferences for contractual forms in supply chains
SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF OPERATIONAL RESEARCH
LA English

DE Supply chain management; Competition; Contracting preferences
ID COORDINATION; COMPETITION
AB The supply chain contracting literature has focused on incentive contracts designed to align supply chain members' individual interests. A key finding of this literature is that members' preferences for contractual forms are often at odds: the upstream supplier prefers relatively complex contracts that can coordinate the supply chain; however, the downstream retailer prefers a wholesale price-only contract because it leaves more surplus (than does a coordinating contract), which the retailer can capture. This paper addresses the following question: Under what circumstances do suppliers and retailers prefer the same contractual form? We study supply chain members' preferences for contractual forms under three different competitive settings in which multiple supply chains compete to sell substitutable products in the same market. Our analysis suggests that both upstream and downstream sides of the supply chain may prefer the same "quantity discount" contract, which would eliminate the conflicts of interest that otherwise typify contracting situations. More interesting still is that both sides may also prefer the wholesale price-only contract; this finding provides a theoretical explanation for why that inefficient (but simple) contract is widely adopted in supply chain transactions.

AB This paper addresses Markov Decision Processes over compact state and action spaces. We investigate the special case of linear dynamics and piecewise-linear and convex immediate costs for the average cost criterion. This model is very general and covers many interesting examples, for instance in inventory management. Due to the curse of dimensionality, the problem is intractable and optimal policies usually cannot be computed, not even for instances of moderate size.
   We show the existence of optimal policies and of convex and bounded relative value functions that solve the average cost optimality equation under reasonable and easy-to-check assumptions. Based on these insights, we propose an approximate relative value iteration algorithm based on piecewise-linear convex relative value function approximations. Besides computing good policies, the algorithm also provides lower bounds to the optimal average cost, which allow us to bound the optimality gap of any given policy for a given instance.
   The algorithm is applied to the well-studied Multiple Sourcing Problem as known from inventory management. Multiple sourcing is known to be a hard problem and usually tackled by parametric heuristics. We analyze several MSP instances with two and more suppliers and compare our results to state-of-the-art heuristics. For the considered scenarios, our policies are always at least as good as the best known heuristic, and strictly better in most cases. Moreover, by using the computed lower bounds we show for all instances that the optimality gap has never exceeded 5%, and that it has been much smaller for most of them. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB In this paper we investigate the problem of finding a safe transit of a ship through areas threatened by sea mines. The aim is to provide decision-making support by a tool that can be integrated into a naval command and control system. We present a route finding algorithm which avoids regions of risk higher than a given threshold. The algorithm takes into account the technical and operational restrictions of the ship's movement. It allows to minimize the route length, the traveling time, the number of maneuvers, or other objectives.
   The basic idea is to embed a network in the operational area and compute a least-cost path. Instead of using a regular grid graph which strongly restricts the types of maneuvers and necessitates a path smoothing after optimization, we design a network which is especially tailored to the maneuverability of the vessel. Each path in this network represents a continuous-curvature track based on combinations of clothoids and straight line segments. The approach allows a large variety of maneuvers, hence high-quality solutions are achievable provided a sufficiently dense network. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This paper presents a cyclical square-root model for the term structure of interest rates assuming that the spot rate converges to a certain time-dependent long-term level. This model incorporates the fact that the interest rate volatility depends on the interest rate level and specifies the mean reversion level and the interest rate volatility using harmonic oscillators. In this way, we incorporate a good deal of flexibility and provide a high analytical tractability. Under these assumptions, we compute closed-form expressions for the values of different fixed income and interest rate derivatives. Finally, we analyze the empirical performance of the cyclical model versus that proposed in Cox et al. (1985) and show that it outperforms this benchmark, providing a better fitting to market data.

AB The role of decision support systems in mitigating operational risks in firms is well established. However, there is a lack of investment in decision support systems in emerging markets, even though inadequate operational risk management is a key cause of discouraging external investment. This has also been exacerbated by insufficient understanding of operational risk in emerging markets, which can be attributed to past operational risk measurement techniques, limited studies on emerging markets and inadequate data.
   In this paper, using current operational risk techniques, the operational risk of developed and emerging market firms is measured for 100 different companies, for 4 different industry sectors and 5 different countries. Firstly, it is found that operational risk is consistently higher in emerging market firms than in the developed markets. Secondly, it is found that operational risk is not only dependent upon the industry sector but also that market development is the more dominant factor. Thirdly, it is found that the market development and the sector influence the shape of the operational risk distribution, in particular tail and skewness risk. Furthermore, an operational risk measurement method is provided that is applicable to emerging markets. Our results are consistent with under investment in decision support systems in emerging markets and imply operational risk management can be improved by increased investment. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB Multi-sensor data fusion is an evolving technology whereby data from multiple sensor inputs are processed and combined. The data derived from multiple sensors can, however, be uncertain, imperfect, and conflicting. The present study is undertaken to help contribute to the continuous search for viable approaches to overcome the problems associated with data conflict and imperfection. Sensor readings, represented by belief functions, have to be fused according to their corresponding weights. Previous studies have often estimated the weights of sensor readings based on a single criterion. Mono-criteria approaches for the assessment of sensor reading weights are, however, often unreliable and inadequate for the reflection of reality. Accordingly, this work opts for the use of a multi-criteria decision aid. A modified Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) that incorporates several criteria is proposed to determine the weights of a sensor reading set. The approach relies on the automation of pairwise comparisons to eliminate subjectivity and reduce inconsistency. It assesses the weight of each sensor reading, and fuses the weighed readings obtained using a modified average combination rule. The efficiency of this approach is evaluated in a target recognition context. Several tests, sensitivity analysis, and comparisons with other approaches available in the literature are described.

   FRAMEWORK
AB Profiling engineered data with robust mining methods continues attracting attention in knowledge engineering systems. The purpose of this article is to propose a simple technique that deals with non-linear multi-factorial multi-characteristic screening suitable for knowledge discovery studies. The method is designed to proactively seek and quantify significant information content in engineered mini-datasets. This is achieved by deploying replicated fractional-factorial sampling schemes. Compiled multi-response data are converted to a single master-response effectuated by a series of distribution-free transformations and multi-compresed data fusions. The resulting amalgamated master response is deciphered by non-linear multi-factorial stealth stochastics intended for saturated schemes. The stealth properties of our method target processing datasets which might be overwhelmed by a lack of knowledge about the nature of reference distributions at play. Stealth features are triggered to overcome restrictions regarding the data normality conformance, the effect sparsity assumption and the inherent collapse of the 'unexplainable error' connotation in saturated arrays. The technique is showcased by profiling four ordinary controlling factors that influence webpage content performance by collecting data from a commercial browser monitoring service on a large scale web host. The examined effects are: (1) the number of Cascading Style Sheets files, (2) the number of JavaScript files, (3) the number of Image files, and (4) the Domain Name System Aliasing. The webpage performance level was screened against three popular characteristics: (1) the time to first visual, (2) the total loading time, and (3) the customer satisfaction. Our robust multi-response data mining technique is elucidated for a ten-replicate run study dictated by an L-g(3(4)) orthogonal array scheme where any uncontrolled noise embedded contribution has not been necessarily excluded.

AB The widespread use of the Internet has significantly changed the behavior of homebuyers. Using online real estate agents, homebuyers can rapidly find some modern houses that meet their needs; however, most current online housing systems provide limit features. In particular, existing systems fail to consider homebuyers' housing goals and risk attitudes. To increase effectiveness, online real estate agents should provide an efficient matching mechanism, personalized service and house ranking with the aim of increasing both buyers' satisfaction and deal rate. An efficient online real estate agent should provide an easy way for homebuyers to find (rank) a suitable house (alternatives) with consideration of their different housing philosophies and risk attitudes. In order to comprehend these ambiguous housing goals and risk attitudes, it is also indispensable to determine a satisfaction level for each fuzzy goal and constraint.
   In this study, we propose fuzzy goal programming with an S-shaped utility function as a decision aid to help homebuyers in choosing their preferred house via the Internet in an easy way. With the use of a decision aid, homebuyers can specify their housing goals and constraints with different priority levels and thresholds as a matching mechanism for a fuzzy search, while the matching mechanism can be translated into a standard query language for a regular relational database. Moreover, a laboratory experiment is conducted on a real case to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. The results indicate that the proposed method provides better customer satisfaction than manual systems in housing selection service. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Traditional methods of applying classification models into the area of credit scoring may ignore the effect from censoring. Survival analysis has been introduced with its ability to deal with censored data. The mixture cure model, one important branch of survival models, is also applied in the context of credit scoring, assuming that the study population is a mixture of never-default and will-default customers.
   We extend the standard mixture cure model through: (1) relaxing the independence assumption of the probability and the time of default; (2) treating the missing defaulting labels as latent variables and applying an augmentation technique; and (3) introducing a discrete truncated exponential distribution to model the time of default. Our full model is written in a hierarchical form so that the Markov chain Monte Carlo method is applied to estimate corresponding parameters.
   Through an empirical analysis, we show that both mixture models, the standard mixture cure model and the hierarchical mixture cure model (HMCM), are more advanced in identifying future defaulters while compared with logistic regression. It is also concluded that our hierarchical Bayesian extension increases the model's predictability and provides meaningful output for risk management. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved,

AB This paper fills a noticeable gap in the current economic and penology literature by proposing new performance-enhancing policies based on an efficiency analysis of a sample of male prisons in England and Wales over the period 2009/10. In addition, we advance the empirical literature by integrating the managerialism of four strategic functions of prisons, employment and accommodation, capacity utilization, quality of life in prison and the rehabilitation and re-offending of prisoners. We find that by estimating multiple models focussing on these different areas some prisons are more efficient than other establishments. In terms of policy, it is therefore necessary to consider not just an overall performance metric for individual prisons, as currently undertaken annually by the UK Ministry of Justice, but to look into the administration and managerialism of their main functions in both a business and public policy perspective. Indeed, it is further necessary to view prisons together and not as single entities, so as to obtain a best practice frontier for the different operations that management undertakes in English and Welsh prisons.

   ALGORITHM
AB Underground mine production scheduling possesses mathematical structure similar to and yields many of the same challenges as general scheduling problems. That is, binary variables represent the time at which various activities are scheduled. Typical objectives seek to minimize costs or some measure of production time, or to maximize net present value; two principal types of constraints exist: (i) resource constraints and (ii) precedence constraints. In our setting, we maximize "discounted metal production" for the remaining life of an underground lead and zinc mine that uses three different underground methods to extract the ore. Resource constraints limit the grade, tonnage, and backfill paste (used for structural stability) in each time period, while precedence constraints enforce the sequence in which extraction (and backfill) is performed in accordance with the underground mining methods used. We tailor exact and heuristic approaches to reduce model size, and develop an optimization-based decomposition heuristic; both of these methods transform a computationally intractable problem to one for which we obtain solutions in seconds, or, at most, hours for problem instances based on data sets from the Lisheen mine near Thurles, Ireland.

   MODEL
AB Wind power has seen strong growth over the last decade and increasingly affects electricity spot prices. In particular, prices are more volatile due to the stochastic nature of wind, such that more generation of wind energy yields lower prices. Therefore, it is important to assess the value of wind power at different locations not only for an investor but for the electricity system as a whole. In this paper, we develop a stochastic simulation model that captures the full spatial dependence structure of wind power by using copulas, incorporated into a supply and demand based model for the electricity spot price. This model is calibrated with German data. We find that the specific location of a turbine - i.e., its spatial dependence with respect to the aggregated wind power in the system - is of high relevance for its value. Many of the locations analyzed show an upper tail dependence that adversely impacts the market value. Therefore, a model that assumes a linear dependence structure would systematically overestimate the market value of wind power in many cases. This effect becomes more important for increasing levels of wind power penetration and may render the large-scale integration into markets more difficult. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB An integrated microbiological economic framework for policy support is developed to determine the cost-effectiveness of alternative intervention methods and strategies to reduce the risk of Campylobacter in broilers. Four interventions at the farm level and four interventions at the processing stage are considered. Cost analyses are conducted for different risk reduction targets and for three alternative scenarios concerning the acceptable range of interventions. Results demonstrate that using a system-wide policy approach to risk reduction can be more cost-effective than a policy focusing purely on farm-level interventions. Allowing for chemical decontamination methods may enhance cost-effectiveness of intervention strategies further. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Based on environmental, legal, social, and economic factors, reverse logistics and closed-loop supply chain issues have attracted attention among both academia and practitioners. This attention is evident by the vast number of publications in scientific journals which have been published in recent years. Hence, a comprehensive literature review of recent and state-of-the-art papers is vital to draw a framework of the past, and to shed light on future directions. The aim of this paper is to review recently published papers in reverse logistic and closed-loop supply chain in scientific journals. A total of 382 papers published between January 2007 and March 2013 are selected and reviewed. The papers are then analyzed and categorized to construct a useful foundation of past research. Finally, gaps in the literature are identified to clarify and to suggest future research opportunities. (C) 2014 Elsevier BM. All rights reserved.

We focus particularly on the issue of solution space connectivity and demonstrate that when this is increased via specialised neighbourhood operators, the quality of solutions achieved is generally enhanced. Across a well-known suite of benchmark problem instances, our proposed algorithm is shown to produce results that are superior to all other methods appearing in the literature; however, we also make note of those instances where our algorithm struggles in comparison to others and offer evidence as to why.

AB In this work a new benchmark of hard instances for the permutation flowshop scheduling problem with the objective of minimising the makespan is proposed. The new benchmark consists of 240 large instances and 240 small instances with up to 800 jobs and 60 machines. One of the objectives of the work is to generate a benchmark which satisfies the desired characteristics of any benchmark: comprehensive, amenable for statistical analysis and discriminant when several algorithms are compared. An exhaustive experimental procedure is carried out in order to select the hard instances, generating thousands of instances and selecting the hardest ones from the point of view of a gap computed as the difference between very good upper and lower bounds for each instance. Extensive generation and computational experiments, which have taken almost six years of combined CPU time, demonstrate that the proposed benchmark is harder and with more discriminant power than the most common benchmark from the literature. Moreover, a website is developed for researchers in order to share sets of instances, best known solutions and lower bounds, etc. for any combinatorial optimisation problem. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

ID RISK; EQUILIBRIUM; MODELS
AB Engineering and operations management decisions have become increasingly complex as a result of recent advances in information technology. The increased ability to access and communicate information has resulted in expanded system domains consisting of multiple agents, each exhibiting autonomous decision-making capabilities, with potentially complex logistics. Challenges regarding the management of these systems include heterogenous utility drivers and risk preferences among the agents, and various sources of system uncertainty. This paper presents a distributed options-based model that manages the impact of multiple forms of uncertainty from a multi-agent perspective, while adapting as both the stream of information and the capabilities of the agents are better known. Because the actions of decision makers may have an impact on the evolution of underlying sources of uncertainty, this endogenous relationship is modeled and a solution approach developed that converges to an equilibrium system state and improves the performance of agents and the system. The final result is a distributed options-based decision-making policy that both responds to and controls the evolution of uncertainty in large-scale engineering and operations management domains.

AB Electric vehicle-sharing systems have been introduced to a number of cities as a means of increasing mobility, reducing congestion, and pollution. Electric vehicle-sharing systems can offer one or two-way services. One-way systems provide more flexibility to users since they can be dropped-off at any station. However, their modeling involves a number of complexities arising from the need to relocate vehicles accumulated at certain stations. The planning of one-way electric vehicle-sharing systems involves a host of strongly interacting decisions regarding the number, size and location of stations, as well as the fleet size.
   In this paper we develop and solve a multi-objective MILP model for planning one-way vehicle-sharing systems taking into account vehicle relocation and electric vehicle charging requirements. For real world problems the size of the problem becomes intractable due to the extremely large number of relocation variables. In order to cope with this problem we introduce an aggregate model using the concept of the virtual hub. This transformation allows the solution of the problem with a branch-and-bound approach.
   The proposed approach generates the efficient frontier and allows decision makers to examine the trade-off between operator's and users' benefits. The capabilities of the proposed approach are demonstrated on a large scale real world problem with available data from Nice, France. Extensive sensitivity analysis was performed by varying demand, station accessibility distance and subsidy levels. The results provide useful insights regarding the efficient planning of one-way electric vehicle-sharing systems and allow decision makers to quantify the trade-off between operator's and users' benefits.

AB This study proposes two location allocation models for handling uncertainty in the strategic planning of hospital networks. The models aim to inform how the hospital networking system may be (re)organized when the decision maker seeks to improve geographical access while minimizing costs. Key features relevant in the design of hospital networks, such as hospitals being multiservice providers operating within a hierarchical structure, are modelled throughout a planning horizon in which network changes may occur. The models hold different assumptions regarding decisions that have to be taken without full information on uncertain parameters and on the recourse decisions which will be made once uncertainty is disclosed. While the first model is in line with previous literature and considers location as first-stage decisions, the second model considers location and allocation as first-stage decisions. Uncertainty associated with demand is modelled through a set of discrete scenarios that illustrate future possible realizations. Both models are applied to a case study based on the Portuguese National Health Service. The results illustrate the information that can be obtained with each model, how models can assist health care planners, and what are the consequences of different choices on the decisions to be taken without complete information. The second model has shown to be advantageous on grounds that location allocation decisions are not scenario dependent, and it appears to be more flexible to handle the planning problem at hand.

AB We discuss how to properly decompose economic efficiency when the underlying technology is non-homothetic using alternative allocative and technical efficiency criteria. We first show that only under the production of one output and assuming the particular case of constant returns to scale homotheticity, we may claim that the standard radial models correctly measure pure technical efficiency. Otherwise, when non-homotheticity is assumed, we then show that these traditional estimations would measure an undetermined mix of technical and allocative efficiency. To restore a consistent measure of technical efficiency in the non-homothetic case we introduce a new methodology that takes as reference for the economic efficiency decomposition the preservation of the allocative efficiency of firms producing in the interior of the technology. This builds upon the so-called reversed approach recently introduced by Bogetoft et al. (2006) that allows estimating allocative efficiency without presuming that technical efficiency has been already accomplished. We illustrate our methodology within the Data Envelopment Analysis framework adopting the most simple non-homothetic BCC model and a numerical application. In this application we show that there are significant differences in the allocative and technical efficiency scores depending on the approach. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This paper deals with the robust optimization for the cyclic hoist scheduling problem with processing time window constraints. The robustness of a cyclic hoist schedule is defined as its ability to remain stable in the presence of perturbations or variations of certain degree in the hoist transportation times. With such a definition, we propose a method to measure the robustness of a cyclic hoist schedule. A bi-objective mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model, which aims to optimize cycle time and robustness, is developed for the robust cyclic hoist scheduling problem. We prove that the optimal cycle time is a strictly increasing function of the robustness and the problem has infinite Pareto optimal solutions. Furthermore, we derive the so-called ideal point and nadir point that define the lower and upper bounds for the objective values of Pareto front. A Pareto optimal solution can be obtained by solving a single-objective MILP model to minimize the cycle time for a given value of robustness or maximize the robustness for a specific cycle time. The single-objective MILP models are solved using commercial optimization software CPLEX. Computational results on several benchmark instances and randomly generated instances indicate that the proposed approach can solve large-scale problems within a reasonable amount of time.

AB We present an algorithm for moment-matching scenario generation. This method produces scenarios and corresponding probability weights that match exactly the given mean, the covariance matrix, the average of the marginal skewness and the average of the marginal kurtosis of each individual component of a random vector. Optimisation is not employed in the scenario generation process and thus the method is computationally more advantageous than previous approaches. The algorithm is used for generating scenarios in a mean-CVaR portfolio optimisation model. For the chosen optimisation example, it is shown that desirable properties for a scenario generator are satisfied, including in-sample and out-of-sample stability. It is also shown that optimal solutions vary only marginally with increasing number of scenarios in this example; thus, good solutions can apparently be obtained with a relatively small number of scenarios. The proposed method can be used either on its own as a computationally inexpensive scenario generator or as a starting point for non-convex optimisation based scenario generators which aim to match all the third and the fourth order marginal moments (rather than average marginal moments).

AB Assuming that the proportion defective in a production process p is variable and the component lifetimes are Weibull distributed, integer nonlinear programming problems are formulated and solved in order to determine the optimum component inspection scheme by attributes for k-out-of-n:F system reliability demonstration using available prior knowledge. A limited beta prior model is adopted to reflect the random fluctuations on p. The required quantity of components to test and the permissible number of component failures up to a specified censoring time are found by solving a minimisation problem with nonlinear constraints which are related to the tolerable average producer and consumer risks. First-order Taylor polynomials of the operating characteristic function are used to derive a quite accurate approximate solution. Lower and upper bounds are also deduced. Optimal solutions are usually robust to small variations in the Weibull parameters and prior information. Existing technical knowledge and experience are shown to be of great practical value in designing optimal sampling plans for lot acceptance purposes. The proposed approach generalises the classical viewpoint to those cases in which appreciable prior information on the fraction of defective systems exists, and also allows the analyst to determine the acceptability of a k-out-of-n:F system before assembly and to limit the range of p. Moreover, the practitioners may attain substantial savings in sample size and improved assessments of the true producer and consumer risks. A 4-out-of-5:F system of independent water pumps for cooling a reactor is considered to illustrate the suggested component test plans. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In the first phase, time aggregation is applied for policy optimization in a prescribed subset of the state space, and a novel result is applied to expand the evaluation to the whole state space. This evaluation is then used in the second phase in a policy improvement step, and the two phases are then alternated until convergence is attained. Some numerical experiments illustrate the results.

AB This article describes a foundation for modelling generic cognitive structures, under the heading nomology, sometimes known as the "science of the processes of the mind". It proposes some principles and axioms that are consistent with the evidence in management systems used in business practice. It then reviews previous research about nomology in philosophy, science and the humanities. It shows that the main issue preventing the completion of the foundation of nomology has been the lack of an explanation of the relationship between the objective "nom" part as in economics and the subjective "ology" part as in psychology. It resolves this problem by showing that there are four main objective activities: proposition, perception, pull and push, and for subjective decisions the pull activity becomes redundant. It then describes tests in China and Chinese culture to validate that the results are truly generic. It proposes that nomology will be useful in providing a rigorous foundation for criteria structures in multi-criteria decision-making, and beyond into wider fields, especially those that combine subjective and objective aspects such as in conflict, inter-cultural and inter-disciplinary studies, ethics, and group decision-making.

Incomplete information about attribute weights is transformed by a sequence of change of variables to a set whose extreme points are readily found. This enhanced method fails to derive the extreme points of every type of incomplete attribute weights. Nevertheless, it provides us with a flexible method for finding the extreme points, including widely-used forms of incomplete attribute weights. Finally, incomplete attribute values, expressed in various forms, are also analyzed to find their characterizing extreme points by applying similar procedures carried out in the incomplete attribute weights.

AB In multi-criteria group decision making, a key issue is aggregating individual preference into group one. In this study, we employ a bilateral agreement to conduct group evaluation of alternatives. The bilateral agreement between a pair of individuals could be on the weight of a criterion, a criterion evaluation function, or willingness to pay. Any one of three types of bilateral agreements can derive the group utility. To express the relationship between the bilateral agreement and individual evaluations, the quasi-arithmetic mean is used, which can ensure the consistency property of the pairwise comparison matrices. The minimum requirements are explored to obtain the group preference, which shows that n - 1 pairs of bilateral agreements are necessary. Finally, several examples are provided to illustrate the proposed methods. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This paper proposes an analysis of the effects of consensus,and preference aggregation on the consistency of pairwise comparisons. We define some boundary properties for the inconsistency of group preferences and investigate their relation with different inconsistency indices. Some results are presented on more general dependencies between properties of inconsistency indices and the satisfaction of boundary properties. In the end, given three boundary properties and nine indices among the most relevant ones, we will be able to present a complete analysis of what indices satisfy what properties and offer a reflection on the interpretation of the inconsistency of group preferences.

AB The eigenvector method (EM) is well-known to derive information from pairwise comparison matrices in decision making processes. However, this method is logically incomplete since its actual numerical error is unknown and its reliability is doubted by such phenomena as "right left asymmetry", "rank reversal", and reversal of "order of intensity of preference".
   In this paper, we associate EM with some standard measuring procedure, analyze this procedure from the viewpoint of measurement theory, and find the actual EM error. We show that the above phenomena have the same cause and are eliminated when the EM errors are taken into account.
   The full decision support tool, which has all components of a standard measuring tool, is composed of pairwise comparisons as an initial measuring procedure, EM as a data processor, and the obtained formulas for EM errors as an error indicator. We consider two versions of this tool based on the right and the left principal eigenvectors of a pairwise comparison matrix. Both versions are equally suitable to measure and rank any comparable elements with positive numerical values, and have the same mean relative errors equal to the square root of the double Saaty's Consistency Index.
   Using the mean relative error, we find the simple upper estimate for maximum permissible errors not impeding the reliable ranking. This estimate imposes tight restrictions on inconsistency of expert judgements in decision making processes with a large number of alternatives. These restrictions are much stronger than previously thought. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Nowadays, modern production patterns, such as batch production, have brought new challenges for multi-unit maintenance decision-making. The maintenance scheduling should not only consider individual machine deterioration, but also apply to batch production with variable lot size. An interactive bi-level maintenance strategy is thus proposed in a multi-unit batch production system with degrading machines. In the machine-level scheduling, a multi-attribute model (MAM) is used to obtain maintenance intervals according to individual machine degradation. In the system-level scheduling, a novel production-driven opportunistic maintenance strategy is developed by considering both machine degradation and characteristics of batch production. In this strategy, advance-postpone balancing (APB) utilizes set-up times as opportunities to make real-time schedules for system-level maintenance. The numerical example shows that the proposed MAM-APB methodology can efficiently eliminate unnecessary production breaks, achieve significant cost reduction and overcome complexity of system scheduling.

AB The paper contributes to the contemporary research on bank efficiency in India. We analyze the efficiency dynamics of the Indian banking industry from 2004 to 2012. Based on the recent methodological developments of the conditional and unconditional directional distances introduced by Daraio and Simar (2014), we apply a conditional directional distance estimator in order to analyze the dynamic effects of industry's performance levels. The results indicate that foreign banks perform better compared to national and domestic private banks. There is also evidence of technological change at the period before the Global Financial Crisis. However during and after the Global Financial Crisis these gains diminished. The evidence suggests that national banks fail to sustain their high performance levels gained after the industry's restructuring period. Finally, the findings support the view that ownership structure affects banks' technical efficiency levels. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In this paper, we measure the performance for each of the Brazilian Agricultural Research Corporation research centers by means of a Data Envelopment Analysis model. Performance data are available for a panel covering the period 2002-2009. The approach is instrumentalist, in the sense of Ramalho, Ramalho, and Henriques (2010). We investigate the effects on performance of contextual variable indicators related to the intensity of partnerships and revenue generation. For this purpose, we propose a fractional nonlinear regression model and dynamic GMM (Generalized Method of Moments) estimation. We do not rule out the endogeneity of the contextual variables, cross-sectional correlation or autocorrelation within the panel. We conclude that revenue generation and previous performance scores are statistically significant and positively associated with actual performance. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The problem of long-term production planning of open pit mines is a large combinatorial problem. Application of mathematical programming approaches suffer from reduced computational efficiency due to the large amount of decision variables. This paper presents a new metaheuristic approximation approach based on the Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) for the solution of the problem of open-pit mine production planning. It is a three-dimensional optimization procedure which has the capability of considering any type of objective function, non-linear constraints and real technical restrictions. The proposed process is programmed and tested through its application on a real scale Copper-Gold deposit. The study revealed that the ACO approach is capable to improve the value of the initial mining schedule regarding the current commercial tools considering penalties and without, in a reasonable computational time. Several variants of ACO were examined to find the most compatible variants and the best parameter ranges. Results indicated that the Max-Min Ant System (MMAS) and the Ant Colony System (ACS) are the best possible variants based on the required less amount of memory. It is also proved that the MMAS is the most explorative variant, while the ACS is the fastest method. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The container relocation problem (CRP) is one of the most crucial issues for container terminals. In a single bay, containers belonging to multiple groups should be retrieved by an equipped yard crane in accordance with their retrieval priorities. An operation of the crane can either relocate a container from the top of a stack to another within the bay, or remove a container with the highest retrieval priority among all remaining containers. The objective of the CRP is to find an optimized operation plan for the crane with the fewest number of container relocations. This paper proposes an improved greedy look-ahead heuristic for the CRP and conducts experiments on four existing data sets. The experimental results show that the proposed approach is able to provide better solutions for large-scale instances in shorter runtime, compared to the up-to-date approaches in the recent literature.

ID COST; INFRASTRUCTURE; ALLOCATION
AB This article presents a systems approach to access charges in unbundling railways where an infrastructure manager charges services to operators on an open market. The motive for this research is the fact that until now no universal model of access charges has been defined. We define a universal access charges model for an essential service package for a mid- and small-size network based on a systems approach to recovering the costs that are incurred as a result of the operation of a train. System elements are a railway network, trains and costs. Having in mind the system complexity a combination of an analytical and engineering approach has been used for access charges modelling. The model has been developed for a Serbian mid-size railway network and tested on real data. The numerical results of model application indicate that with charges defined in this way it is possible to track cost and cost management by services. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The proposed method, combining the advantages of evolutionary algorithms and statistical model, has provided useful tools to construct portfolios and generate effective stock trading strategies for investors with different risk-attitudes. Simulation results on five stock indices show that model based on GNP and maximum Sharpe Ratio portfolio performs the best in bull market, and that based on GNP and the global minimum risk portfolio performs the best in bear market. The portfolios constructed by Markowitz's mean-variance model performs the same as mean-CVaR model. It is clarified that the proposed system significantly improves the function and efficiency of original GNP, which can help investors make profitable decisions. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB Cherchye, De Rock, Dierynck, Roodhooft, and Sabbe (2013) introduced a DEA methodology that is specially tailored for multi-output efficiency measurement. The methodology accounts for jointly used inputs and incorporates information on how inputs are allocated to outputs. In this paper, we present extensions that render the methodology useful to deal with undesirable (or "bad") outputs in addition to desirable (or "good") outputs. Interestingly, these extensions deal in a natural way with several limitations of existing DEA approaches to treat undesirable outputs. We also demonstrate the practical usefulness of our methodological extensions through an application to US electric utilities. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This article studies the role of social capital on cotton production efficiency and productivity for a sample of small farms in Maharashtra, India using data envelopment analysis. Input shadow prices are computed as an indicator of the importance of social capital relative to other inputs. Results suggest social capital to be the input with the highest contribution to production efficiency after land. The Luenberger indicator is used to assess the productivity improvement associated to an investment in social capital, which is found to be on the order of 12%. Undertaking collective production activities is found to play an important role in improving productivity. This is especially relevant to agricultural households facing important economic and institutional restrictions that make it difficult to increase conventional (expensive) inputs, (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB We present an information good pricing model with persistently heterogeneous consumers and a rising marginal propensity for them to pirate. The dynamic pricing problem faced by a legal seller is solved using a flexible numerical procedure with demand discretisation and sales tracking. Three offsetting pricing mechanisms occur: skimming, compressing price changes, and delaying product launch. A novel trade-off in piracy's effect on welfare is identified. We find that piracy quickens sales times and raises welfare in fixed size markets, and does the opposite in growing markets. In our model, consumers benefit from very high rates of piracy, legal sellers always dislike it, and pirate providers like moderate but not very high rates. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB In this study, we investigate two important questions related to dynamic pricing in distribution channels: (i) Are coordinated pricing decisions efficient in a context where prices have carry-over effects on demand? (ii) Should firms practice a skimming or a penetration strategy if they choose to coordinate or to decentralize their activities? To answer these questions, we consider a differential game that takes place in a bilateral monopoly where the past retail prices paid by consumers contribute to the building of a reference price. The latter is used by consumers as a benchmark to evaluate the value of the product, and by firms to decide whether to adopt a skimming or a penetration strategy.
   We then compute and compare strategies, total channel profits and individual profits under vertical integration and decentralization at steady state and along the optimal time-paths. One of our main findings states that, for some values of the initial reference price, there is a time interval where channel decentralization performs better than coordination. During this transition period, at least one of the channel members could be tempted to end his cooperation, especially if he is not farsighted and if there are no binding agreements with the other channel partners.

AB This article is motivated by the case of a company manufacturing industrial equipment that faces two types of demand: on the one hand there are the so-called regular orders for installations or refurbishing of existing facilities, these orders have a relatively long lead time; on the other hand there are urgent orders mostly related to spare parts when a facility has a breakdown, the delay in such case is much shorter but higher margins can be obtained. We study the order acceptance problem for a firm that serves two classes of demand over an infinite horizon. The firm has to decide whether to accept a regular order (or equivalently how much capacity to set aside for urgent orders) in order to maximize its profit. We formulate this problem as a multi-dimensional Markovian Decision Process (MDP). We propose a family of approximate formulations to reduce the dimension of the state space via aggregation. We show how our approach can be used to compute bounds on the profit associated with the optimal order acceptance policy. Finally, we show that the value of revenue management is commensurate with the operational flexibility of the firm. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ID GIVEN-DEFAULT; LOAN; RATES
AB Loss given default modelling has become crucially important for banks due to the requirement that they comply with the Basel Accords and to their internal computations of economic capital. In this paper, support vector regression (SVR) techniques are applied to predict loss given default of corporate bonds, where improvements are proposed to increase prediction accuracy by modifying the SVR algorithm to account for heterogeneity of bond seniorities. We compare the predictions from SVR techniques with thirteen other algorithms. Our paper has three important results. First, at an aggregated level, the proposed improved versions of support vector regression techniques outperform other methods significantly. Second, at a segmented level, by bond seniority, least square support vector regression demonstrates significantly better predictive abilities compared with the other statistical models. Third, standard transformations of loss given default do not improve prediction accuracy. Overall our empirical results show that support vector regression techniques are a promising technique for banks to use to predict loss given default. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Firms face a continuous process of technological and environmental changes that requires them to make managerial decisions in a dynamic context. However, costs and constraints prevent firms from making instant adjustments towards optimal conditions and may cause inefficiency to persist in time. We propose a dynamic inefficiency specification that captures differences in the adjustment costs among firms and non-persistent effects of inefficiency heterogeneity. The model is fitted to a ten year sample of Colombian banks. The new specification improves model fit and have effects on efficiency estimations. Overall, Colombian banks present high inefficiency persistence but important differences between institutions are found. In particular, merged banks present low adjustment costs that allow them to recover rapidly efficiency losses derived from merging processes. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This paper presents a multi-level Taguchi-factorial two-stage stochastic programming (MTTSP) approach for supporting water resources management under parameter uncertainties and their interactions. MTTSP is capable of performing uncertainty analysis, policy analysis, factor screening, and interaction detection in a comprehensive and systematic way. A water resources management problem is used to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed approach. The results indicate that interval solutions can be generated for the objective function and decision variables, and a variety of decision alternatives can be obtained under different policy scenarios. The experimental data obtained from the Taguchi's orthogonal array design are helpful in identifying the significant factors affecting the total net benefit. Then the findings from the multi-level factorial experiment reveal the latent interactions among those important factors and their curvature effects on the model response. Such a sequential strategy of experimental designs is useful in analyzing the interactions for a large number of factors in a computationally efficient manner. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB In this paper we present the Selective Graph Coloring Problem, a generalization of the standard graph coloring problem as well as several of its possible applications. Given a graph with a partition of its vertex set into several clusters, we want to select one vertex per cluster such that the chromatic number of the subgraph induced by the selected vertices is minimum. This problem appeared in the literature under different names for specific models and its complexity has recently been studied for different classes of graphs. Here, we describe different models - some already discussed in previous papers and some new ones - in very different contexts under a unified framework based on this graph problem. We point out similarities between these models, offering a new approach to solve them, and show some generic situations where the selective graph coloring problem may be used. We focus on specific graph classes motivated by each model, and we briefly discuss the complexity of the selective graph coloring problem in each one of these graph classes and point out interesting future research directions.

AB In this paper, we consider a generic inexact subgradient algorithm to solve a nondifferentiable quasi-convex constrained optimization problem. The inexactness stems from computation errors and noise, which come from practical considerations and applications. Assuming that the computational errors and noise are deterministic and bounded, we study the effect of the inexactness on the subgradient method when the constraint set is compact or the objective function has a set of generalized weak sharp minima. In both cases, using the constant and diminishing stepsize rules, we describe convergence results in both objective values and iterates, and finite convergence to approximate optimality. We also investigate efficiency estimates of iterates and apply the inexact subgradient algorithm to solve the Cobb Douglas production efficiency problem. The numerical results verify our theoretical analysis and show the high efficiency of our proposed algorithm, especially for the large-scale problems. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Four NP-hard optimization problems on graphs are studied: The vertex separator problem, the edge separator problem, the maximum clique problem, and the maximum independent set problem. We show that the vertex separator problem is equivalent to a continuous bilinear quadratic program. This continuous formulation is compared to known continuous quadratic programming formulations for the edge separator problem, the maximum clique problem, and the maximum independent set problem. All of these formulations, when expressed as maximization problems, are shown to follow from the convexity properties of the objective function along the edges of the feasible set. An algorithm is given which exploits the continuous formulation of the vertex separator problem to quickly compute approximate separators. Computational results are given. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB This study considers a hybrid assembly-differentiation flowshop scheduling problem (HADFSP), in which there are three production stages, including components manufacturing, assembly, and differentiation. All the components of a job are processed on different machines at the first stage. Subsequently, they are assembled together on a common single machine at the second stage. At the third stage, each job of a particular type is processed on a dedicated machine. The objective is to find a job schedule to minimize total flow time (TFT). At first, a mixed integer programming (MIP) model is formulated and then some properties of the optimal solution are presented. Since the NP-hardness of the problem, two fast heuristics (SPT-based heuristic and NEH-based heuristic) and three hybrid meta-heuristics (HGA-VNS, HDDE-VNS and HEDA-VNS) are developed for solving medium- and large-size problems. In order to evaluate the performances of the proposed algorithms, a lower bound for the HADFSP with TFT criteria (HAD-FSP-TFT) is established. The MIP model and the proposed algorithms are compared on randomly generated problems. Computational results show the effectiveness of the MIP model and the proposed algorithms. The computational analysis indicates that, in average, the HDDE-VNS performs better and more robustly than the other two meta-heuristics, whereas the NEH heuristic consume little time and could reach reasonable solutions.

AB We investigate two scheduling problems. The first is scheduling with agreements (SWA) that consists in scheduling a set of jobs non-preemptively on identical machines in a minimum time, subject to constraints that only some specific jobs can be scheduled concurrently. These constraints are represented by an agreement graph. We extend the NP-hardness of SWA with three distinct values of processing times to only two values and this definitely closes the complexity status of SWA on two machines with two fixed processing times. The second problem is the so-called resource-constrained scheduling. We prove that SWA is polynomially equivalent to a special case of the resource-constrained scheduling and deduce new complexity results of the latter. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A Passive Optical Network (PUN) is a network technology for deploying access networks based on passive optical components. In a single PUN access network, the client terminals are connected to a Central Office through optical splitters and interconnecting fibers where each splitter splits in equal parts the input optical signal coming from the Central Office over its different output fibers. In this paper, we consider PUN topology solutions where the splitting ratio and the number of splitting stages are not constrained to a given target design but, instead, are decided based on the cost of the solutions. We present different Integer Linear Programming formulations to model this problem and provide computational results showing that the optimal solutions can be computed for realistic problem instances. In addition, we describe how the formulations can be adapted for the traditional PUN topology approaches and present computational results showing that significant cost gains are obtained with the unconstrained splitting stage approach.

AB The classical objective function of the Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) is to minimize the total distance traveled by all vehicles (Min-Sum). In several situations, such as disaster relief efforts, computer networks, and workload balance, the minimization of the longest route (Min-Max) is a better objective function. In this paper, we compare the optimal solution of several variants of the Min-Sum and the Min-Max VRP, from the worst-case point of view. Our aim is two-fold. First, we seek to motivate the design of heuristic, metaheuristic, and matheuristic algorithms for the Min-Max VRP, as even the optimal solution of the classical Min-Sum VRP can be very poor if used to solve the Min-Max VRP. Second, we aim to show that the Min-Max approach should be adopted only when it is well-justified, because the corresponding total distance can be very large with respect to the one obtained by optimally solving the classical Min-Sum VRP.

AB We study the General Routing Problem defined on a mixed graph and with stochastic demands. The problem under investigation is aimed at finding the minimum cost set of routes to satisfy a set of clients whose demand is not deterministically known. Since each vehicle has a limited capacity, the demand uncertainty occurring at some clients affects the satisfaction of the capacity constraints, that, hence, become stochastic. The contribution of this paper is twofold: firstly we present a chance-constrained integer programming formulation of the problem for which a deterministic equivalent is derived. The introduction of uncertainty into the problem poses severe computational challenges addressed by the design of a branch-and-cut algorithm, for the exact solution of limited size instances, and of a heuristic solution approach exploring promising parts of the search space. The effectiveness of the solution approaches is shown on a probabilistically constrained version of the benchmark instances proposed in the literature for the mixed capacitated general routing problem.

AB The prevalence of intermediaries (middlemen) in supply chains is often seen as a dying remnant of less efficient times. Despite predictions that supply chains will rapidly "cut out the middleman" as technological advances have eased logistics, middlemen have continued to thrive. In this paper, we demonstrate a transaction role of middlemen that may help clarify their staying power. In a model with self-interested decision-making by both a manufacturer and a retailer, wherein incentive misalignment creates investment and production inefficiencies, we show that the integrated (first-best) outcome can be achieved with simple cost-based contracts if and only if a middleman is present. We further show that the approach of utilizing a middleman to fully coordinate the supply chain is robust in that it can be applied to a variety of circumstances discussed in the literature, including multilateral investment/effort choices, multiple product providers, and logistical investments made by the middleman.

ID CHANNEL COORDINATION; PRICE; COMPETITION; PERFORMANCE
AB From the practices of Chinese consumer electronics market, we find there are two key issues in supply chain management: The first issue is the contract type of either wholesale price contracts or consignment contracts with revenue sharing, and the second issue is the decision right of sales promotion (such as advertising, on-site shopping assistance, rebates, and post-sales service) owned by either manufacturers or retailers. We model a supply chain with one manufacturer and one retailer who has limited capital and faces deterministic demand depending on retail price and sales promotion. The two issues interact with each other. We show that only the combination (called as chain business mode) of a consignment contract with the manufacturer's right of sales promotion or a wholesale price contract with the retailer's right of sales promotion is better for both members. Moreover, the latter chain business mode is realized only when the retailer has more power in the chain and has enough capital, otherwise the former one is realized. But which one is preferred by customers? We find that the former is preferred by customers who mainly enjoy low price, while the latter is preferred by those who enjoy high sales promotion level.

Here 'similar' means that the system has the same structure and the component lifetimes have the same dependence (joint reliability copula). Some comparison results are obtained for the likelihood ratio order, failure rate order, reversed failure rate order and the usual stochastic order. Similar results are reported for comparing inactivity time of a coherent system with lifetime of similar coherent system having component lifetimes same as inactivity times of failed components.

AB We present a method to solve the free-boundary problem that arises in the pricing of classical American options. Such free-boundary problems arise when one attempts to solve optimal-stopping problems set in continuous time. American option pricing is one of the most popular optimal-stopping problems considered in literature. The method presented in this paper primarily shows how one can leverage on a one factor approximation and the moving boundary approach to construct a solution mechanism. The result is an algorithm that has superior runtimes-accuracy balance to other computational methods that are available to solve the free-boundary problems. Exhaustive comparisons to other pricing methods are provided. We also discuss a variant of the proposed algorithm that allows for the computation of only one option price rather than the entire price function, when the requirement is such.

AB In this paper we consider a production process at operative level on 171 identical parallel machines, which are subject to stochastic machine failures. To avoid long downtime of the machines, caused by unexpected failures, preventive maintenance activities are planned and conducted, but if a failure could not be averted a corrective maintenance has to be performed. Both maintenance activities are assumed to restore the machine to be "as good as new". The maintenance activities, the number of jobs and their allocation to machines as well as their sequence have a large impact on the performance of the production process and the delivery dates.
   We study an order of n jobs, scheduled for a frozen period on the machines. It is assumed that jobs, interrupted by machine failure, have to get repeated right after the corrective maintenance is finished (non-resumable case). We first derive an exact formula for the expected makespan. Since the exact evaluation of a schedule is highly complex, we propose two approximations for the expected makespan. The excellent performance of the approximations is illustrated in a numerical study. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Necessary and sufficient conditions for input/output estimation are established utilizing Pareto and weak Pareto solutions of linear multiple-objective programming problems. Furthermore, in this paper we introduce a new optimality notion for multiple-objective programming problems, periodic weak Pareto optimality. These solutions are used in inverse DEA, and it is shown that these can be characterized by a simple modification in weighted sum scalarization tool. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This paper addresses the optimization under uncertainty of the self-scheduling, forward contracting, and pool involvement of an electricity producer operating a mixed power generation station, which combines thermal, hydro and wind sources, and uses a two stage adaptive robust optimization approach. In this problem the wind power production and the electricity pool price are considered to be uncertain, and are described by uncertainty convex sets. To solve this problem, two variants of a constraint generation algorithm are proposed, and their application and characteristics discussed. Both algorithms are used to solve two case studies based on two producers, each operating equivalent generation units, differing only in the thermal units' characteristics. Their market strategies are investigated for three different scenarios, corresponding to as many instances of electricity price forecasts. The effect of the producers' approach, whether conservative or more risk prone, is also investigated by solving each instance for multiple values of the so-called budget parameter. It was possible to conclude that this parameter influences markedly the producers' strategy, in terms of scheduling, profit, forward contracting, and pool involvement. These findings are presented and analyzed in detail, and an attempted rationale is proposed to explain the less intuitive outcomes. Regarding the computational results, these show that for some instances, the two variants of the algorithms have a similar performance, while for a particular subset of them one variant has a clear superiority.

ID DEA; MODEL; BANKS
AB To impose the law of one price (LoOP) restrictions, which state that all firms face the same input prices, Kuosmanen, Cherchye, and Sipilainen (2006) developed the top-down and bottom-up approaches to maximizing the industry-level cost efficiency. However, the optimal input shadow prices generated by the above approaches need not be unique, which influences the distribution of the efficiency indices at the individual firm level. To solve this problem, in this paper, we developed a pair of two-level mathematical programming models to calculate the upper and lower bounds of cost efficiency for each firm in the case of non-unique LoOP prices while keeping the industry cost efficiency optimal. Furthermore, a baseenumerating algorithm is proposed to solve the lower bound models of the cost efficiency measure, which are bi-level linear programs and NP-hard problems. Lastly, a numerical example is used to demonstrate the proposed approach. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB We investigate a single-leg airline revenue management problem where an airline has limited demand information and uncensored no-show information. To use such hybrid information for simultaneous overbooking and booking control decisions, we combine expected overbooking cost with revenue. Then we take a robust optimization approach with a regret-based criterion. While the criterion is defined on a myriad of possible demand scenarios, we show that only a small number of them are necessary to compute the objective. We also prove that nested booking control policies are optimal among all deterministic ones. We further develop an effective computational method to find the optimal policy and compare our policy to others proposed in the literature. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In the framework of spatial competition, two or more players strategically choose a location in order to attract consumers. It is assumed standardly that consumers with the same favorite location fully agree on the ranking of all possible locations. To investigate the necessity of this questionable and restrictive assumption, we model heterogeneity in consumers' distance perceptions by individual edge lengths of a given graph. A profile of location choices is called a "robust equilibrium" if it is a Nash equilibrium in several games which differ only by the consumers' perceptions of distances. For a finite number of players and any distribution of consumers, we provide a complete characterization of robust equilibria and derive structural conditions for their existence. Furthermore, we discuss whether the classical observations of minimal differentiation and inefficiency are robust phenomena. Thereby, we find strong support for an old conjecture that in equilibrium firms form local clusters. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ID DATA ENVELOPMENT ANALYSIS
AB Performance-based budgeting has received increasing attention from public and for-profit organizations in an effort to achieve a fair and balanced allocation of funds among their individual producers or operating units for overall system optimization. Although existing frontier estimation models can be used to measure and rank the performance of each producer, few studies have addressed how the mismeasurement by frontier estimation models affects the budget allocation and system performance. There is therefore a need for analysis of the accuracy of performance assessments in performance-based budgeting. This paper reports the results of a Monte Carlo analysis in which measurement errors are introduced and the system throughput in various experimental scenarios is compared. Each scenario assumes a different multi-period budgeting strategy and production frontier estimation model; the frontier estimation models considered are stochastic frontier analysis (SFA) and data envelopment analysis (DEA). The main results are as follows: (1) the selection of a proper budgeting strategy and benchmark model can lead to substantial improvement in the system throughput; (2) a "peanut butter" strategy outperforms a discriminative strategy in the presence of relatively high measurement errors, but a discriminative strategy is preferred for small measurement errors; (3) frontier estimation models outperform models with randomly-generated ranks even in cases with relatively high measurement errors; (4) SFA outperforms DEA for small measurement errors, but DEA becomes increasingly favorable relative to SFA as the measurement errors increase.

ID GAUSSIAN RANDOM-VARIABLES; ALGORITHM; NETWORKS; SET
AB In the stochastic variant of the vehicle routing problem with time windows, known as the SVRPTW, travel times are assumed to be stochastic. In our chance-constrained approach to the problem, restrictions are placed on the probability that individual time window constraints are violated, while the objective remains based on traditional routing costs. In this paper, we propose a way to offer this probability, or service level, for all customers. Our approach carefully considers how to compute the start-service time and arrival time distributions for each customer. These distributions are used to create a feasibility check that can be "plugged" into any algorithm for the VRPTW and thus be used to solve large problems fairly quickly. Our computational experiments show how the solutions change for some well-known data sets across different levels of customer service, two travel time distributions, and several parameter settings.

AB Generating companies use the maintenance cost function as the sole or main objective for creating the maintenance schedule of power generators. Usually only maintenance activities related costs are considered to derive the cost function. However, in deregulated markets, maintenance related costs alone do not represent the full costs of generators. This paper models various cost components that affect the maintenance activities in deregulated power markets. The costs that we model include direct and indirect maintenance, failures, interruptions, contractual compensation, rescheduling, and market opportunity. The loss of firm's reputation and selection of loyalty model are also considered using the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) within an opportunity cost model. A case study is used to illustrate the modelling activities. The enhanced model is utilised in generator maintenance scheduling cases. The experimental results demonstrate the importance and impact of market related costs in maintenance schedules. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The shortage of medical resources (mainly beds) is a critical and increasingly prevalent problem affecting hospitals. Of the factors that contribute to these shortages, the ambiguity and insufficiency of the criteria used to identify whether an inpatient should be discharged are among the most detrimental. To address this issue, this study applies data envelopment analysis (DEA) on existing inpatient data from the Neurorehabilitation Center at Toronto's Bridgepoint Hospital to create a dynamic benchmarking system to evaluate the health stage of an inpatient ready to be discharged. Unlike the more traditional parametric techniques, DEA provides non-subjective benchmarking that does not require any prior specification of the production function making it a more desirable choice for this application. The dynamic model categorizes the inpatient's discharge status as rejected, under observation, or approved. This new approach not only allows managers to gain insight into the potential causes of medical resource shortages, but also allows clinicians to treat inpatients more effectively based on their discharge categories. For validation, the results of the dynamic model were compared with actual inpatient discharge assessments provided by the Bridgepoint Hospital. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The aim of this paper is twofold. On the one hand, it provides a contribution to the debate on judicial efficiency by conducting an applied research on the Italian tax judiciary thanks to a database covering the activities of the Italian tax courts over a 3-year period (2009-2011). On the other hand, it also contributes to the methodological debate, as it compares results obtained with Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) and Directional Distance Function (DDF), two related non-parametric techniques which allow evaluating the efficiency of each observation as the radial distance from the efficient frontier defined by the best observations. While DEA has already been used to assess the mere technical efficiency of judicial systems, the DDF offers a valuable additional contribution, since it makes it possible to minimize the social cost of production of adjudication in the measurement. This feature makes it particularly attractive in those sectors in which production externalities may arise, such as judicial delays in the case investigated here. Additionally, the paper first applies the bootstrap to the DDF procedure in order to provide more robust estimates and to compare them with the DEA results. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB This paper introduces a multi-project problem environment which involves multiple projects with assigned due dates; activities that have alternative resource usage modes; a resource dedication policy that does not allow sharing of resources among projects throughout the planning horizon; and a total budget. Three issues arise when investigating this multi-project environment. First, the total budget should be distributed among different resource types to determine the general resource capacities, which correspond to the total amount for each renewable resource to be dedicated to the projects. With the general resource capacities at hand, the next issue is to determine the amounts of resources to be dedicated to the individual projects. The dedication of resources reduces the scheduling of the projects' activities to a multi-mode resource constrained project scheduling problem (MRCPSP) for each individual project. Finally, the last issue is the efficient solution of the resulting MRCPSPs. In this paper, this multi-project environment is modeled in an integrated fashion and designated as the resource portfolio problem. A two-phase and a monolithic genetic algorithm are proposed as two solution approaches, each of which employs a new improvement move designated as the combinatorial auction for resource portfolio and the combinatorial auction for resource dedication. A computational study using test problems demonstrated the effectiveness of the solution approach proposed. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In particular, we describe several alternatives to specialize the construction and improvement components of GRASP when two or more objectives are considered. GRASP has been successfully coupled with Path Relinking for single-objective optimization. Moreover, we propose different hybridizations of GRASP and Path Relinking for multiobjective optimization. We apply the proposed GRASP with Path Relinking variants to two combinatorial optimization problems, the biobjective orienteering problem and the biobjective path dissimilarity problem. We report on empirical tests with 70 instances and 30 algorithms, that show that the proposed heuristics are competitive with the state-of-the-art methods for these problems. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB In some important group decision making, a moderator representing the collective interest, who has predetermined, and possesses an effective leadership and strong interpersonal communication and negotiation skills, is crucial to the consensus reaching. In the process of consensus reaching, the moderator needs to persuade each individual to change his/her opinion towards a consensus opinion by paying a minimum cost, while the individuals have to modify and to gradually approach this consensus opinion by expecting to obtain a maximum compensation. This paper, which proposes two kinds of minimum cost models with regard to all the individuals and one particular individual respectively, shows the economic significance of these two models by exploring their dual models grounded in the primal-dual linear programming theory, and builds the conditions under which these two models have the same optimal consensus opinion. The validity of the theoretical analysis is confirmed by numerical examples. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB It has been reported that since year 2000, there have been an average 700 water main breaks per day only in Canada and the USA costing more than CAD 10 billions/year. Moreover, water main leaks affect other neighboring infrastructure that may lead to catastrophic failures. For this, municipality authorities or stakeholders are more concerned about preventive actions rather reacting to failure events. This paper presents a Bayesian Belief Network (BBN) model to evaluate the risk of failure of metallic water mains using structural integrity, hydraulic capacity, water quality, and consequence factors. BBN is a probabilistic graphical model that represents a set of variables and their probabilistic relationships, which also captures historical information about these dependencies. The proposed model is capable of ranking water mains within distribution network that can identify vulnerable and sensitive pipes to justify proper decision action for maintenance/rehabilitation/replacement (M/R/R). To demonstrate the application of proposed model, water distribution network of City of Kelowna has been studied. Result indicates that almost 9% of the total 259 metallic pipes are at high risk in both summer and winter. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This paper uses a fully nonparametric approach to estimate efficiency measures for primary care units incorporating the effect of (exogenous) environmental factors. This methodology allows us to account for different types of variables (continuous and discrete) describing the main characteristics of patients served by those providers. In addition, we use an extension of this nonparametric approach to deal with the presence of undesirable outputs in data, represented by the rates of hospitalization for ambulatory care sensitive condition (ACSC). The empirical results show that all the exogenous variables considered have a significant and negative effect on efficiency estimates. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This paper examines the combined use of predictive analytics, optimization, and overbooking to schedule outpatient appointments in the presence of no-shows. We tackle the problem of optimally overbooking appointments given no-show predictions that depend on the individual appointment characteristics and on the appointment day. The goal is maximizing the number of patients seen while minimizing waiting time and overtime. Our analysis leads to the definition of a near-optimal and simple heuristic which consists of giving same-day appointments to likely shows and future-day appointments to likely no-shows. We validate our findings by performing extensive simulation tests based on an empirical data set of nearly fifty thousand appointments from a real outpatient clinic. The results suggest that our heuristic can lead to a substantial increase in performance and that it should be preferred to open access under most parameter configurations. Our paper will be of great interest to practitioners who want to improve their clinic performance by using individual no-show predictions to guide appointment scheduling. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB This study surveys the increasing research field of performance measurement by making use of a bibliometric literature analysis. We concentrate on two approaches, namely Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) and Stochastic Frontier Analysis (SFA) as the most important methods to evaluate the efficiency of individual and organizational performance. It is the first literature survey that analyses DEA and SFA publications jointly, covering contributions published in journals, indexed by the Web of Science database from 1978 to 2012. Our aim is to identify seminal papers, playing a major role in DEA and SFA development and to determine areas of adoption. We recognized a constant growth of publications during the years identifying DEA as a standard technique in Operations Research, whereas SFA is mainly adopted in Economic research fields. Making use of document co-citation analysis we identify Airports and Supplier Selection (DEA) as well as Banking and Agriculture (SFA) as most influential application areas. Furthermore, Sensitivity and Fuzzy Set Theory (DEA) as well as Bayesian Analysis and Heterogeneity (SFA) are found to be most influential research areas and seem to be methodological trends. By developing an adoption rate of knowledge we identify that research, in terms of citations, is more focusing on relatively old and recent research at the expenses of middle-aged contributions, which is a typical phenomenon of a fast developing discipline.

AB Assigning tasks to work stations is an essential problem which needs to be addressed in an assembly line design. The most basic model is called simple assembly line balancing problem type 1 (SALBP-1). We provide a survey on 12 heuristics and 9 lower bounds for this model and test them on a traditional and a lately-published benchmark dataset. The present paper focuses on algorithms published before 2011. We improve an already existing dynamic programming and a tabu search approach significantly. These two are also identified as the most effective heuristics; each with advantages for certain problem characteristics. Additionally we show that lower bounds for SALBP-1 can be distinctly sharpened when merging them and applying problem reduction techniques. (C) 2014 The Author. Published by Elsevier B.V.

DT Article
DE Packing; 2D bin-packing; Sequential value correction
ID RECTANGULAR STRIP PACKING; ALGORITHM
AB A heuristic approach for the two-dimensional bin-packing problem is proposed. The algorithm is based on the sequential heuristic procedure that generates each pattern to produce some items and repeats until all items are produced. Both guillotine and non-guillotine patterns can be used. Each pattern is obtained from calling a pattern-generation procedure, where the objective is to maximize the pattern value. The item values are adjusted after the generation of each pattern using a value correction formula. The algorithm is compared with five published algorithms, using 50 groups of benchmark instances. The results indicate that the algorithm is the most efficient in improving solution quality. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB We consider a random yield inventory system, where a company has access to real time information about the actual yield realizations. To contribute to a better understanding of the value of this information, we develop a mathematical model of the inventory system and derive structural properties. We build on these properties to develop an optimal solution approach that can be used to solve small to medium sized problems. To solve large problems, we develop two heuristics. We conduct numerical experiments to test the performances of our approaches and to identify conditions under which real time yield information is particularly beneficial. Our research provides the approaches that are necessary to implement inventory control policies that utilize real time yield information. The results can also be used to estimate the cost savings that can be achieved by using real time yield information. The cost savings can then be compared against the required investments to decide if such an investment is profitable. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Deceptive counterfeits differ from non-deceptive ones in that they are packaged and sold as authentic brand name products so that consumers may buy counterfeits unknowingly. When a distribution channel, referred to as the general channel, has been penetrated with deceptive counterfeits, a brand name company may need to restructure the way its products are distributed and rely on reliable channels such as certified stores or manufacturer-owned stores to guarantee 100% authenticity. In this paper, we first identify the conditions under which the general channel will carry deceptive counterfeits, and then analyze the optimal supply chain structure in the presence of counterfeits as well as by incorporating the wholesale price decisions, consumers' risk attitude towards counterfeits and consumer loyalty towards the reliable stores. Our main finding is that the brand name company should continue to sell, sometimes exclusively, through the general channel despite deceptive counterfeiting under various conditions.

AB This paper implements and tests a label-setting algorithm for finding optimal hyperpaths in large transit networks with realistic headway distributions. It has been commonly assumed in the literature that headway is exponentially distributed. To validate this assumption, the empirical headway data archived by Chicago Transit Agency are fitted into various probabilistic distributions. The results suggest that the headway data fit much better with Loglogistic, Gamma and Erlang distributions than with the exponential distribution. Accordingly, we propose to model headway using the Erlang distribution in the proposed algorithm, because it best balances realism and tractability. When headway is not exponentially distributed, finding optimal hyperpaths may require enumerating all possible line combinations at each transfer stop, which is tractable only for a small number of alternative lines. To overcome this difficulty, a greedy method is implemented as a heuristic and compared to the brute-force enumeration method. The proposed algorithm is tested on a large scale CTA bus network that has over 10,000 stops. The results show that (1) the assumption of exponentially distributed headway may lead to sub-optimal route choices and (2) the heuristic greedy method provides near optimal solutions in all tested cases.

AB Metro station corridor width design considering demand fluctuation as well as the randomness and state-dependence of service time is an urgent concern and a complicated random planning issue. This paper confirms the accuracy of phase-type distribution (PH) fitting for passenger arrival intervals and service times with randomness and state-dependence in metro station corridors. A PH/PH(n)/C/C state-dependent queuing model is thus established by a finite level-dependent quasi-birth-death (QBD) process. The existing M/G(n)/C/C, M/G/1/C, and D/D/1/C models are proved to be special cases of the PH/PH(n)/C/C model through theoretical derivation and the precision of the proposed model is analyzed through simulation tests. The quantitative relationship between the level of service (LOS) and the corridor width is established based on the proposed model. A total of 81 experiments are designed to compare the calculations between the proposed model and the M/G(n)/C/C, M/G/1/C, and D/D/1/C models. Comparison results demonstrate that (1) the value of effective width of the PH/PH(n)/C/C queuing model is higher than those of the MIG(n)/C/C, M/G/1/C, and D/D/1/C models; (2) the real area occupied per person in the corridor of the PH/PH(n)/C/C queuing model is mostly proximate to the designed LOS, whereas those of the MIG(n)/C/C, M/G/1/C, and D/D/1/C models fail to meet the designed LOS; and (3) the performance measures of the PH/PH(n)/C/C queuing model enjoy high performance-width elasticity and are significantly improved compared with those of the M/G(n)/C/C, M/G/1/C, and D/D/1/C models.

AB Consider a general coherent system with independent or dependent components, and assume that the components are randomly chosen from two different stocks, with the components of the first stock having better reliability than the others. Then here we provide sufficient conditions on the component's lifetimes and on the random numbers of components chosen from the two stocks in order to improve the reliability of the whole system according to different stochastic orders. We also discuss several examples in which such conditions are satisfied and an application to the study of the optimal random allocation of components in series and parallel systems. As a novelty, our study includes the case of coherent systems with dependent components by using basic mathematical tools (and copula theory). (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

DE The M/G/2 queue; The M/(M+G)/2 queue; The M/M,G/2 queue
AB This article discusses the steady state analysis of the M/G/2 queuing system with two heterogeneous servers under new queue disciplines when the classical First Come First Served '(FCFS)' queue discipline is to be violated. Customers are served either by server-I according to an exponential service time distribution with mean rate it or by server-II with a general service time distribution B(t). Sequel to some objections raised in the literature on the use of the classical FCFS queue discipline in heterogeneous service systems, two alternative queue disciplines (Serial and Parallel) are considered in this work with the objective that if the FCFS is violated then the violation is a minimum in the long run. Using the embedded method under the serial queue discipline and the supplementary variable technique under the parallel queue discipline, we present an exact analysis of the steady state number of customers in the system and most importantly, the actual waiting time expectation of customers in the system. Our work shows that one can obtain all stationary probabilities and other vital measures for this queue under certain simple but realistic assumptions. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Given a set of players and the cost of each possible coalition, the question we address is which coalitions should be formed. We formulate mixed integer linear programming models for this problem, considering core stability and strong equilibrium. The objective function looks for minimizing the total cost allocated among the players. Concerned about the difficulties of managing large coalitions in practice, we also study the effect of a maximum cardinality constraint per coalition. We test the models in two applications. One is in collaborative forest transportation and the other one in inventory of spare parts for oil operations. In these situations, collaboration opportunities involving significant savings exist, but for several reasons, it may be better to group the players in different sub-coalitions rather than in the grand coalition. The models we propose are thus relevant for deciding how to partition the set of players. We also prove that if the strong equilibrium model is feasible, its optimal cost is equal to the optimal cost of the core stability model and, consequently, a coalition structure that solves one problem also solves the other problem. We present results that illustrate this property. We also present results where the core stability problem is feasible and the strong equilibrium problem is infeasible. Setting an upper bound on the maximum cardinality of the coalitions, allows us to study the marginal savings of enlarging the cardinality of the coalitions. We find that the marginal savings of allowing one more player significantly decreases as the bound increases. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ID PRODUCTION-INVENTORY GAMES; COST-REDUCTION; PROCESS INNOVATION; SUPPLY
   CHAIN; EXTENSIONS
AB Process improvement plays a significant role in reducing production costs over the life cycle of a product. We consider the role of process improvement in a decentralized assembly system in which a buyer purchases components from several first-tier suppliers. These components are assembled into a finished product, which is sold to the downstream market. The assembler faces a deterministic demand/production rate and the suppliers incur variable inventory costs and fixed setup production costs. In the first stage of the game, which is modeled as a non-cooperative game among suppliers, suppliers make investments in process improvement activities to reduce the fixed production costs. Upon establishing a relationship with the suppliers, the assembler establishes a knowledge sharing network - this network is implemented as a series of meetings among suppliers and also mutual visits to their factories. These meetings facilitate the exchange of best practices among suppliers with the expectation that suppliers will achieve reductions in their production costs from the experiences learned through knowledge sharing. We model this knowledge exchange as a cooperative game among suppliers in which, as a result of cooperation, all suppliers achieve reductions in their fixed costs. In the non-cooperative game, the suppliers anticipate the cost allocation that results from the cooperative game in the second stage by incorporating the effect of knowledge sharing in their cost functions. Based on this model, we investigate the benefits and challenges associated with establishing a knowledge sharing network. We identify and compare various cost allocation mechanisms that are feasible in the cooperative game and show that the system optimal investment levels can be achieved only when the most efficient supplier receives the incremental benefits of the cost reduction achieved by other suppliers due to the knowledge transfer.

AB The Choquet integral preference model is adopted in Multiple Criteria Decision Aiding (MCDA) to deal with interactions between criteria, while the Stochastic Multiobjective Acceptability Analysis (SMAA) is an MCDA methodology considered to take into account uncertainty or imprecision on the considered data and preference parameters. In this paper, we propose to combine the Choquet integral preference model with the SMAA methodology in order to get robust recommendations taking into account all parameters compatible with the preference information provided by the Decision Maker (DM). In case the criteria are on a common scale, one has to elicit only a set of non-additive weights, technically a capacity, compatible with the DM's preference information. Instead, if the criteria are on different scales, besides the capacity, one has to elicit also a common scale compatible with the preferences given by the DM. Our approach permits to explore the whole space of capacities and common scales compatible with the DM's preference information. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In most multi-objective optimization problems we aim at selecting the most preferred among the generated Pareto optimal solutions (a subjective selection among objectively determined solutions). In this paper we consider the robustness of the selected Pareto optimal solution in relation to perturbations within weights of the objective functions. For this task we design an integrated approach that can be used in multi-objective discrete and continuous problems using a combination of Monte Carlo simulation and optimization. In the proposed method we introduce measures of robustness for Pareto optimal solutions. In this way we can compare them according to their robustness, introducing one more characteristic for the Pareto optimal solution quality. In addition, especially in multi-objective discrete problems, we can detect the most robust Pareto optimal solution among neighboring ones. A computational experiment is designed in order to illustrate the method and its advantages. It is noteworthy that the Augmented Weighted Tchebycheff proved to be much more reliable than the conventional weighted sum method in discrete problems, due to the existence of unsupported Pareto optimal solutions.

AB Soft OR tools have increasingly been used to support the strategic development of companies at operational and managerial levels. However, we still lack OR applications that can be useful in dealing with the "implementation gap", understood as the scarcity of resources available to organizations seeking to align their existing processes and structures with a new strategy. In this paper we contribute to filling that gap, describing an action research case study where we supported strategy implementation in a Latin American multinational corporation through a soft OR methodology. We enhanced the 'Methodology to support organizational self-transformation', inspired by the Viable System Model, with substantive improvements in data collection and analyses. Those adjustments became necessary to facilitate second order learning and agreements on required structural changes among a large number of participants. This case study contributes to the soft OR and strategy literature with insights about the promise and constraints of this soft OR methodology to collectively structure complex decisions that support organizational redesign and strategy implementation.

AB We study appointment scheduling problems in continuous time. A finite number of clients are scheduled such that a function of the waiting time of clients, the idle time of the server, and the lateness of the schedule is minimized. The optimal schedule is notoriously hard to derive within reasonable computation times. Therefore, we develop the lag order approximation method, that sets the client's optimal appointment time based on only a part of his predecessors. We show that a lag order of two, i.e., taking two predecessors into account, results in nearly optimal schedules within reasonable computation times. We illustrate our approximation method with an appointment scheduling problem in a CT-scan area. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This study applies the Dynamic Slacks Based Model (DSBM) developed by Tone and Tsutsui (2010) in order to assess the evolution of input saving/output increasing potentials in major Brazilian Banks from 1996 to 2011. We propose that these potentials or slacks can be used as proxies for an eventual financial distress situation in the future. The main research objective is to determine whether or not different characteristics of bank type related to ownership, size, and merger and acquisition processes are significantly related to inefficiency levels and, by extension, to an eventual financial distress situation, since higher inefficiency levels also imply lower input saving/output decreasing potentials. Based on a balanced panel model, secondary data from Economatica were collected and analyzed. Results indicate higher inefficiency levels and slacks in small public and national banks. Policy implications are also addressed. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Using a market share attraction structure of advertising competition and following a supermodular game approach, this article demonstrates for an asymmetric oligopoly, the directional impact of changes in model parameters on the marketing controlled variables of all rivals (advertising budgets) and the operations controlled variables of all rivals (ordered quantities). Importantly, the various changes are examined analytically, empirically and numerically in both non-dominated and dominated asymmetric oligopolies.
   In this regard, the results indicate that firms in a dominated oligopoly (one firm of market share larger than or equal to 50%) behave differently compared to firms in a non-dominated oligopoly (each firm of market share less than 50%) in response to changes in model parameters. Furthermore, changes in model parameters are investigated in terms of their relative influential impact on a variety of equilibrium measures. In this regard, the findings indicate that for the analyzed model the marketing parameters exert much more influence on the equilibrium measures than the operations parameters.
   Additionally, a change in the mode of competition from non-cooperation (oligopoly) to cooperation (joint ownership) dictates that strong asymmetric firms (of favorable marketing and operations parameters) continue advertising (but at lower levels) and weak asymmetric firms (of less favorable parameters) cease advertising altogether.

AB We analyze the role of quality, which we define as an attribute of a product that increases consumers' willingness to buy, as a competitive tool in a quality-price setting. We consider an incumbent's entry-deterrence strategies using quality as a deterrent when faced by a potential entrant. We investigate settings motivating the incumbent to blockade the entrant (i.e., prevent entry without extra effort), deter the entrant (i.e., prevent entry with extra effort), or accommodate the entrant (i.e., allow the entry to take place). We identify conditions under which the incumbent may actually over-invest in quality to deter entrance. More interestingly, we also identify conditions under which the incumbent may decrease his quality investment to make it easier for the entrant to penetrate the market. Our model sheds light on entry scenarios of particular platform product markets such as the entry of Xbox to the video game console market. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
