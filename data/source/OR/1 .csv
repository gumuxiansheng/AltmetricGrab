AB In this paper we address the question of how to allocate the total cost of building and maintaining an airport runway among its users based on a non-cooperative approach. We present a non-cooperative bargaining game with a unique Nash equilibrium outcome whose payoffs are the Shapley value of an airport problem. Furthermore, it is shown that all strategy profiles leading to a subgame perfect equilibrium in these games are also coalition-proof.

AB Bank industry plays a critical role in the economic development of China. In this paper, we develop a new two-stage data envelopment analysis approach for measuring the slacks-based efficiency of Chinese commercial banks during years 2008-2012, where the banking operation process of each bank is divided into a deposit-generation stage (division) and a deposit-utilization stage (division). In the approach, the increase of desirable outputs and the decrease of undesirable outputs are simultaneously considered in order to identify the inefficiency of a bank. Three efficiency statuses are first defined for such a system to investigate its input-output performance and divisional performances, and a full efficiency status is then defined based on these statuses. The empirical results show that the improvement of the banks' performances during this period was mainly contributed by the improvement of deposit-utilization stage. Besides, the results also show that our approach can provide a benchmark for the intermediate measures of the two stages of an inefficient bank.

AB We consider a discrete-time queueing system in which the arriving customers can decide to follow a LCFS discipline or to join the queue. Breakdowns can occur with geometrical lifetime and repair times governed by an arbitrary distribution. The repair times can exert changes governed by a geometrical law. We carry out a thorough study of the model deriving analytical results for the stationary distributions. We obtain generating functions of the number of customers in the queue and in the system. We also obtain the generating function of the repair times taking into account possible changes in the remaining repair times. The generating functions of the busy period, sojourn time in the server, sojourn time in the queue as well as some performance measures are also provided.

AB This article is motivated by two related research questions about research activity in the Operations Research/Management Science/Operations Management (OR/MS/OM) and Finance disciplines. First, we investigate the influence of co-authorship on article impact in OR/MS/OM. Second, we develop a number of citation metrics to explore the nature of scholarly exchange between top OR/MS/OM and Finance journals. We work with a large sample of articles published across 2001-2008 for twenty OR/MS/OM journals and nineteen Finance journals, with corresponding citations up to and including year 2012. Key findings from the first research question indicate a higher impact for articles with multiple authors, but with the marginal gain brought by an additional author being insignificant for articles with three or more authors. For the second research question, we find that the Finance discipline borrows less from OR/MS/OM than vice versa, which highlights the potential for wider collaboration among researchers-particularly for Finance academics in exploring how various OR/MS/OM techniques can be adopted or adapted into their research. Finally, we discover that the ranking of OR/MS/OM journals is determined more by the extent that they are cited in other disciplines, but observe a gradual rise in self-perpetuating behavior in the OR/MS/OM discipline.

AB In order to reduce informational asymmetry a signaling contract seems to be an efficient solution. Standard theory argues that insurance contracts typically produce separating equilibria. Mostly, this property is based on the assumption of two states of the world only. If however, there is a world with a continuum of states the solution is different. We prove that there is no longer a separating equilibrium. As a result, insurance markets are characterized by pooling equilibria or self-insurance structures.

AB A key issue in the practical applicability of the support vector machine methodology is the identification of the support vectors in very large data sets, a problem to which a great deal of attention has been given in the literature. In the present article we propose methods based on sampling and nearest neighbors, that allow for an efficient implementation of an approximate solution to the classification problem and, at least in some problems, will help in identifying a significant fraction of the support vectors in large data sets at low cost. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated in different examples and some of its theoretical properties are discussed.

AB The intent of this research is to generate a set of non-dominated finite-memory policies from which one of two agents (the leader) can select a most preferred policy to control a dynamic system that is also affected by the control decisions of the other agent (the follower). The problem is described by an infinite horizon total discounted reward, partially observed Markov game (POMG). For each candidate finite-memory leader policy, we assume the follower, fully aware of the leader policy, determines a (perfect memory) policy that optimizes the follower's (scalar) criterion. The leader-follower assumption allows the POMG to be transformed into a specially structured, partially observed Markov decision process that we use to determine the follower's best response policy for a given leader policy. We then approximate the follower's policy by a finite-memory policy. Each agent's policy assumes that the agent knows its current and recent state values, its recent actions, and the current and recent possibly inaccurate observations of the other agent's state. For each leader/follower policy pair, we determine the values of the leader's criteria. We use a multi-objective genetic algorithm to create the next generation of leader policies based on the values of the leader criteria for each leader/follower policy pair in the current generation. Based on this information for the final generation of policies, we determine the set of non-dominated leader policies. We present an example that illustrates how these results can be used to support a manager of a liquid egg production process (the leader) in selecting a sequence of actions to maximize expected process productivity while mitigating the risk due to an attacker (the follower) who seeks to contaminate the process with a chemical or biological toxin.

AB We consider a leader-follower partially observed Markov game (POMG) and analyze how the value of the leader's criterion changes due to changes in the leader's quality of observation of the follower. We give conditions that insure improved observation quality will improve the leader's value function, assuming that changes in the observation quality do not cause the follower to change its policy. We show that discontinuities in the value of the leader's criterion, as a function of observation quality, can occur when the change of observation quality is significant enough for the follower to change its policy. We present conditions that determine when a discontinuity may occur and conditions that guarantee a discontinuity will not degrade the leader's performance. We show that when the leader and the follower are collaborative and the follower completely observes the leader's initial state, discontinuities in the leader's value function will not occur. However, examples show that improving observation quality does not necessarily improve the leader's criterion value, whether or not the POMG is a collaborative game.

AB Missing values and inconsistency of pairwise comparison matrices (PCM) in AHP are tackled with different methods in extant studies. In this article, we prove that connecting path method (CPM), which is a well-known approach of estimating missing judgments, also guarantees minimal geometric consistency index, and only involves elementary connecting paths by unraveling its connection with logarithmic least square method. The formal proofs suggest that CPM alone is sufficient to fix both missing judgments and inconsistency of PCM in AHP. Based on this well grounded merit, a procedure is proposed to improve consistency for incomplete PCM. The validity of the proposed procedure is illustrated by classical examples, and its advantages over other consistency improving approaches are also discussed in detail.

AB Firms that use an emerging technology often face uncertainty in both the arrival of new versions and the revenue that may be earned from their deployment. Via a sequential decision-making framework, we determine the value of the investment opportunity and the optimal replacement rule under three different strategies: compulsive, laggard, and leapfrog. In the first one, a firm invests sequentially in every version that becomes available, whereas in the second and third ones, it first waits for a new version to arrive and then either invests in the older or the newer version, respectively. We show that, under a compulsive strategy, technological uncertainty has a non-monotonic impact on the optimal investment decision. In fact, uncertainty regarding the availability of future versions may actually hasten investment. By comparing the relative values of the three strategies, we find that, under a low output price the compulsive strategy always dominates, whereas, at a high output price, the incentive to wait for a new version and adopt either a leapfrog or a laggard strategy increases as the rate of innovation increases. By contrast, high price uncertainty mitigates this effect, thereby increasing the relative attraction of a compulsive strategy.

TI Robust timing of markdowns

ID OPTIMIZATION
AB We propose an approach to the timing of markdowns in a continuous-time finite-horizon setting that does not require the precise knowledge of the underlying probabilities, instead relying on range forecasts for the arrival rates of the demand processes, and that captures the degree of the manager's risk aversion through intuitive budget of uncertainty functions. These budget functions bound the cumulative deviation of the arrival rates from their nominal values over the lengths of time for which a product is offered at a given price. A key issue is that using lengths of time as decision variables introduces non-convexities when budget functions are concave. In the single-product case, we describe a tractable and intuitive framework to incorporate uncertainty on customers' arrival rates, formulate the resulting robust optimization model, describe an efficient procedure to compute the optimal sale times, and provide theoretical insights. We then describe how to use the solution of the static robust optimization model to implement a dynamic markdown policy. We also extend the robust optimization approach to multiple products and suggest the idea of constraint aggregation to preserve performance for this type of problem structure.

TI The single-item lot-sizing polytope with continuous start-up costs and

SO ANNALS OF OPERATIONS RESEARCH

DT Article
DE Lot-sizing; Continuous start-up; Polyhedral combinatorics
AB In this work we consider the uniform capacitated single-item single-machine lot-sizing problem with continuous start-up costs. A continuous start-up cost is generated in a period whenever there is a nonzero production in the period and the production capacity in the previous period is not saturated. This concept of start-up does not correspond to the standard (discrete) start-up considered in previous models, thus motivating a polyhedral study of this problem. In this work we explore a natural integer programming formulation for this problem. We consider the polytope obtained as convex hull of the feasible points in this problem. We state some general properties, study whether the model constraints define facets, and present an exponentially-sized family of valid inequalities for it. We analyze the structure of the extreme points of this convex hull, their adjacency and bounds for the polytope diameter. Finally, we study the particular case when the demands are high enough in order to require production in all the periods. We provide a complete description of the convex hull of feasible solutions in this case and show that all the inequalities in this description are separable in polynomial time, thus proving its polynomial time solvability.

TI Microgrid investment under uncertainty: a real option approach using

AB The traditional net present value approach to investment in microgrid assets does not take into account the inherent uncertainties in fuel prices, cost of technology, and microgrid load profile. We propose a real option approach to microgrid investment, which includes solar photovoltaic (PV) and gas-fired generation assets. Likewise the (n, m) exchange literature in real option analysis, we examine cases with interdependency and independency of fuel price and the cost of PV technology. This work, however, makes a major contribution by the way of introducing a new parameter, which is defined as the elasticity of the option value to prices and is used in the formulation of closed form solutions. We further extend the (1, 1) exchange problem here to include operational flexibility of microgrid, such that optimal switching between investment, suspension and re-activation can be examined.

AB This paper investigates information security investment strategies under both targeted attacks and mass attacks by considering strategic interactions between two competitive firms and a hacker. We find that the more attractive firm invests more in information security, suffers more frequent attacks and enjoys a lower expected benefit, while the hacker achieves a higher expected benefit under targeted attacks than under mass attacks. We further examine the effect of security requirements on the two firms' investment strategies in information security. We indicate that security requirements sometimes can drastically alter the comparisons of these investment strategies under the two types of cyber attacks. The hacker would balance the firms' attractiveness in information assets and security requirements when determining its investment decisions in cyber attacks. By assuming that security requirements are endogenous, we demonstrate that under targeted attacks and mass attacks both firms would like to regulate rigorous security requirements when their degree of competition becomes fierce but would like to choose loose security requirements when the degree of competition remains mild.

AB We consider in this paper solutions for TU-games where it is not assumed that the grand coalition is necessarily the final state of cooperation. Partitions of the grand coalition, or balanced collections together with a system of balancing weights interpreted as a time allocation vector are considered as possible states of cooperation. The former case corresponds to the c-core, while the latter corresponds to the aspiration core or d-core, where in both case, the best configuration (called a maximising collection) is sought. We study maximising collections and characterize them with autonomous coalitions, that is, coalitions for which any solution of the d-core yields a payment for that coalition equal to its worth. In particular we show that the collection of autonomous coalitions is balanced, and that one cannot have at the same time a single possible payment (core element) and a single possible configuration. We also introduce the notion of inescapable coalitions, that is, those present in every maximising collection. We characterize the class of games for which the sets of autonomous coalitions, vital coalitions (in the sense of Shellshear and Sudholter), and inescapable coalitions coincide, and prove that the set of games having a unique maximising coalition is dense in the set of games.

AB The paper presents new approximability results for single machine scheduling problems with jobs requiring some non-renewable resources (like raw materials, energy, or money) beside the machine. Each resource has an initial stock and additional supplies over time. A feasible schedule specifies a starting time for each job such that no two jobs overlap in time, and when a job is started, enough resources are available to cover its requirements. The goal is to find a feasible schedule of minimum makespan. This problem is strongly NP-hard. Recently, the authors of this paper have proposed a PTAS for the special case with a single non-renewable resource and with a constant number of supply dates, as well as an FPTAS for the special case with two supply dates and one resource only. In this paper we prove APX-hardness of the problem when the number of resources is part of the input, and new polynomial time approximation schemes are devised for some variants, including (1) job release dates, and more than one, but constant number of resources and resource supply dates, and (2) only one resource, arbitrary number of supply dates and job release dates, but with resource requirements proportional to job processing times.

AB Nowadays the power generation and transmission are substantial elements for the society, and will definitely play a more important role in the future. In this paper a modeling framework is presented to analyze security constrained composite generation and transmission expansion planning problem in power systems. Despite of the traditional expansion planning approaches where only supply side options are considered, the proposed approach accounts for both supply and demand side management (DSM) options simultaneously. DSM options are incorporated to correct the shape of the load duration curve in terms of peak clipping and load shifting programs. A mixed integer non-linear programming model is developed to find the optimal location and timing of electricity generation/transmission as well as DSM options while the effect of transmission losses are also taken into account. Nonlinearity of the transmission loss terms is eliminated using the piecewise linearization. Motivating from the structure of the model, Benders decomposition (BD) algorithm is devised. Three effective strategies named: valid inequalities, multiple generation cuts and strong high density cut are also employed to improve the convergence of the proposed BD algorithm. The performance of the accelerated BD algorithm is validated via applying it to the modified 6, 21, 48, 57, 118 and 300 bus IEEE reliability test systems. The computational experiments ensure the practicality of the proposed BD algorithm in terms of decreasing the number of iterations and CPU times.

AB Approximating stochastic processes by scenario trees is important in decision analysis. In this paper we focus on improving the approximation quality of trees by smaller, tractable trees. In particular we propose and analyze an iterative algorithm to construct improved approximations: given a stochastic process in discrete time and starting with an arbitrary, approximating tree, the algorithm improves both, the probabilities on the tree and the related path-values of the smaller tree, leading to significantly improved approximations of the initial stochastic process. The quality of the approximation is measured by the process distance (nested distance), which was introduced recently. For the important case of quadratic process distances the algorithm finds locally best approximating trees in finitely many iterations by generalizing multistage k-means clustering.

AB On the one hand, constraint satisfaction problems allow one to expressively model problems. On the other hand, propositional satisfiability problem (SAT) solvers can handle huge SAT instances. We thus present a technique to expressively model set constraint problems and to encode them automatically into SAT instances. We apply our technique to the social golfer problem and we also use it to break symmetries of the problem. Our technique is simpler, more expressive, and less error-prone than direct modeling. The SAT instances that we automatically generate contain less clauses than improved direct instances such as in Triska and Musliu (Ann Oper Res 194(1):427-438, 2012), and with unit propagation they also contain less variables. Moreover, they are well-suited for SAT solvers and they are solved faster as shown when solving difficult instances of the social golfer problem.

AB The practice of emergency operations often involves the travelling of medical teams and the distribution of medical supplies. In an emergency, such as an earthquake, a medical team often has to visit various hospitals (the customers) one after another in a predetermined sequence in order to perform on-site operations that require certain amounts of medical supplies. Because of their perishable nature, the medical supplies are typically shipped in batches from upstream suppliers and kept at multiple distribution centers during the disaster relief process. The scheduling of the medical teams and the provisioning of the medical supplies give rise to a scheduling problem that involves the timely dispatching of supplies from distribution centers to hospitals in coordination with the scheduling of medical teams so as to minimize the total tardiness of the completions of the operations to be performed. We introduce a mathematical programming based rolling horizon heuristic that is able to find near optimal solutions for networks of up to 80 hospitals very fast. We also report on empirical observations with regard to the computational performance of the heuristic; we consider 5420 randomly generated test cases as well as a case that is based on an actual hospital-distribution center network in the greater New York metropolitan area. Managerial insights are drawn from numerical studies regarding the benefits of pre-positioning medical supplies at the distribution centers.

AB Complex decision support systems often consist of component modules which, encoding the judgements of panels of domain experts, describe a particular sub-domain of the overall system. Ideally these modules need to be pasted together to provide a comprehensive picture of the whole process. The challenge of building such an integrated system is that, whilst the overall qualitative features are common knowledge to all, the explicit forecasts and their associated uncertainties are only expressed individually by each panel, resulting from its own analysis. The structure of the integrated system therefore needs to facilitate the coherent piecing together of these separate evaluations. If such a system is not available there is a serious danger that this might drive decision makers to incoherent and so indefensible policy choices. In this paper we develop a graphically based framework which embeds a set of conditions, consisting of the agreement usually made in practice of certain probability and utility models, that, if satisfied in a given context, are sufficient to ensure the composite system is truly coherent. Furthermore, we develop new message passing algorithms entailing the transmission of expected utility scores between the panels, that enable the uncertainties within each module to be fully accounted for in the evaluation of the available alternatives in these composite systems.

AB The bilevel programming problem is strongly NP-hard and non-convex, which implies that the problem is very challenging for most canonical optimization approaches using single-point search techniques to find global optima. In the present paper, a class of nonlinear bilevel programming problems are considered where the follower is a linear fractional program. Based on a novel coding scheme, a genetic algorithm with global convergence was developed. First, potential bases of the follower's problem were taken as individuals, and a genetic algorithm was used to explore these bases. In addition, in order to evaluate each individual, a fitness function was presented by making use of the optimality conditions of linear fractional programs. Also, the fitness evaluation, as a sub-procedure of optimization, can partly improve the leader's objective. Finally, some computational examples were solved and the results show that the proposed algorithm is efficient and robust.

AB We present an algorithm to solve two-stage stochastic convex problems, whose objective function and constraints are nonlinear. It is based on the twin-node-family concept involved in the Branch-and-Fix Coordination method. These problems have 0-1 mixed-integer recourse variables in the first stage and only continuous variables in the second stage. The non-anticipativity constraints are satisfied by means of the twin-node-family strategy. In this work to solve each nonlinear convex subproblem at each node we propose the solution of sequences of quadratic subproblems. Since the convexity of the constraints we can approximate them by means of outer approximations. These methods have been implemented in C with the help of Cplex 12.1, which only solves the quadratic approximations. The test problems have been randomly generated by using a C code developed by this author. Numerical experiments have been performed and its efficiency has been compared with that of well-known codes.

AB Having multiple optimal solutions to weights affects to a great extent the consistency of operations related to weights. The cross efficiency method is the most frequently studied topic in data envelopment analysis (DEA) literature. Originally, the cross efficiency method included the efficiency evaluations that were obtained for a decision making unit (DMU) by the classical DEA for the reuse of optimal weights in other DMUs. As the optimal weights in classical DEA solutions usually have multiple solutions, this reduces the usefulness of the cross evaluation. Lam (J Oper Res Soc 61:134-143, 2010) proposed a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) formulation based on linear discriminant analysis and super efficiency method to choose suitable weight sets to be used in cross efficiency evaluation. In this study, Lam's MILP model has been modified to reduce the steps during the solution process. The model also becomes a linear programming model after the modification to make it easier to use and to reduce the computational complexity. Numerical examples indicate that the proposed weight determination model both reduces the steps and minimizes computational complexity. Furthermore, it has similar performance with Lam's MILP model for the cross efficiency evaluation.

We characterize especially semidefinite positive correlation measures consistent with the choices of risk-averse investors. Moreover, we propose a new approach to portfolio selection problem, which optimizes the correlation between the portfolio and one or two market benchmarks. We also discuss why should correlation measures be used to reduce the dimensionality of large scale portfolio problems. Finally, through an empirical analysis, we show the impact of different correlation measures on portfolio selection problems and on dimensionality reduction problems. In particular, we compare the ex post sample paths of several portfolio strategies based on different risk measures and correlation measures.

AB Coordination and integration among various members of a supply chain has become one of the vital strategies for the modern manufacturers to gain competitive advantages. This paper studies an NP-hard problem of the two-stage scheduling in which jobs are processed by two parallel machines and delivered to the distribution center with the objective of minimizing the makespan. There exists an unavailable interval on one of the machines due to preventive maintenance and an unfinished job can resume processing after the machine becomes available again. Wang and Cheng (Nav Res Logist 54:11-20, 2007) first studied this problem and presented an algorithm H2 with a worst-case ratio of 5/3. This paper proposes a new algorithm which leads to a best possible solution with a worst-case ratio of 3/2.

   DELIVERY GAMES
AB A multi-depot Chinese postman problem (MDCP) arises from a network (e.g. cityplan) in which several depots are located wherefrom edges (e.g. streets) have to be served. Since costs are involved with each visit to an edge, the objective is to find a minimum cost tour in the network that visits all edges of the network. Such a minimum cost tour consists of a collection of subtours such that the subtours originate from different depots, and each subtour starts and ends at the same depot. This typical OR problem turns into a multi decision maker problem if agents are assigned to the streets. In this new setting the cost of a minimum cost tour that visits all edges have to be paid by the agents. However, now each group of agents (coalition) has the opportunity to find its own minimum cost tour, i.e. a minimum cost tour that only visits the edges owned by the group of agents. Therefore, the main objective is to find allocations of the cost of a minimum tour that visits all agents in such a way that no coalition has higher costs than the costs incurred by its own minimum tour. We will use cooperative game theory to investigate whether these so-called core allocations exist. Therefore, we consider a cooperative Chinese postman (CP) game that is induced by an MDCP by associating every edge of the network with a different agent. In this paper, we characterize classes of networks that ensure the existence of core allocations, the so-called CP balanced graphs, and the existence of specific core allocations, the so-called CP submodular graphs.

This is a subset of cutting and packing problems of renowned practical and theoretical relevance. A mixed integer-linear programming formulation is proposed to optimize the packing of particular polygonal shapes, convex forms with 3-8 sides, since their opposite sides are parallel. The model can be used to pack enclosures of general irregular shapes, generating upper bounds to the optimal solutions. The model was tested with 270 mass generated instances of small dimensions.

AB Conventional data envelopment analysis (DEA) models make the assumption of non-negativity and real values in the input and output of the systems that are under study. This paper combines these two interrelated ideas. One is the non-radial measurement of efficiency by establishing an aggregate directional distance formulation of the DEA model (ADDM). Another is the introduction of an integer directional distance function. Usually, directional distance formulations of DEA and ADDM projections of efficient targets for inefficient decision making units (DMUs) have non-integer values. In this paper directional distance function is modified and a mixed integer directional distance formulation of DEA is proposed. This model guarantees integer targets for inefficient DMUs and is applicable to measure efficiency even when input and output variables are negative integer values.

AB Consider a system which is subject to occasional failures over its lifetime. Under general stochastic assumptions concerning the occurrence of these failures, the duration of the repair times, and the length of the system's lifetime, the distribution of the total uptime the system accumulates over its lifetime may be determined. While the distribution is unfortunately complicated except in certain circumstances, it is possible to derive useful bounds based on the aging characteristics of the distributions of interfailure times, repair times, and system life. Bounds are developed for the cases where the system lifetime follows (1) a degenerate distribution (or constant mission duration), (2) an exponential distribution, and (3) a general distribution. These bounds may be interpreted as extensions of well-known bounds based on aging notions from renewal theory. Conditions are identified for when the bounds are sharp, and examples are used to show the computational tractability and usefulness of the results.

AB When to stop testing is an important aspect in software test management. This paper discusses a new approach to this problem. There are two major improvements in this approach in comparison to the earlier studies. It uses failure size proportional model to estimate the number of failures and the corresponding cost of repair. Instead of reliability it uses a new measure called attained failure size. Failure size is the probability of finding a failure causing input in the input domain. Attained failure size is the failure size at the termination of testing. The advantages of these improvements are also discussed.

ID CONTRACTS; MARKETS; COMPETITION; INNOVATION
AB In this study we investigate the effort of a service platform in cooperation with a hotel and its influence on the hotel's decision about the quantity of reserved rooms. We begin with a newsvendor hotel facing two kinds of customers: D-customers and C-customers. The D-customers order rooms from the hotel's front desk while the C-customers book rooms through a service platform, i.e., Ctrip.com. The hotel makes decisions about how many rooms to allot to Ctrip.com to achieve optimal profit. Two newsvendor settings are proposed that depict the demands of the two parties independently. We discuss a fixed payment contract and a cost sharing contract and find that the cost sharing contract achieves channel coordination and that the division of profit depends upon the hotel's payment to Ctrip.com. We then extend our study by taking into consideration the effort Ctrip.com exerts. We verify that a cost sharing contract can achieve channel coordination imperfectly if the idle cost of a vacant reserved room is shared between the hotel and Ctrip.com. Further, given that the cost of effort is shared, the channel is coordinated and a win-win is guaranteed as well if the terms of the new cost sharing contract are properly chosen.

AB In this paper we present a greedy algorithm for solving the problem of the maximum partitioning of graphs with supply and demand (MPGSD). The goal of the method is to solve the MPGSD for large graphs in a reasonable time limit. This is done by using a two stage greedy algorithm, with two corresponding types of heuristics. The solutions acquired in this way are improved by applying a computationally inexpensive, hill climbing like, greedy correction procedure. In our numeric experiments we analyze different heuristic functions for each stage of the greedy algorithm, and show that their performance is highly dependent on the properties of the specific instance. Our tests show that by exploring a relatively small number of solutions generated by combining different heuristic functions, and applying the proposed correction procedure we can find solutions within only a few percent of the optimal ones.

ID MEASURING EFFICIENCY; DEA; PERFORMANCE; MODELS; DECOMPOSITION; INDUSTRY
AB Sales fluctuations lead to variations in the output levels affecting technical efficiency measures of operations when units sold are used at an output measure. The present study uses the concept of "effective production" and "effectiveness" to account for the effect of sales on operational performance measurements in a production system. The effectiveness measure complements the efficiency measure which does not account for the sales effect. The Malmquist productivity index is used to measure the sales effects characterized as the difference between the production function associated with efficiency and the sales-truncated production function associated with effectiveness. The proposed profit effectiveness is distinct from profit efficiency in that it accounts for sales. An empirical study of US airlines demonstrates the proposed method which describes the strategic position of a firm and a productivity-change analysis. These results demonstrate the concept of effectiveness and quantifies the effect of using sales as output.

ID ACHIEVEMENT SCALARIZING FUNCTION; EVOLUTIONARY; SEARCH
AB Reference point-based methods are very useful techniques for solving multiobjective optimization problems. In these methods, the most commonly used achievement scalarizing functions are based on the Tchebychev distance (minmax approach), which generates every Pareto optimal solution in any multiobjective optimization problem, but does not allow compensation among the deviations to the reference values given that it minimizes the value of the highest deviation. At the same time, for any , compromise programming minimizes the distance to the ideal objective vector from the feasible objective region. Although the ideal objective vector can be replaced by a reference point, achievable reference points are not supported by this approach, and special care must be taken in the unachievable case. In this paper, for , we propose a new scheme based on the distance, in which different single-objective optimization problems are designed and solved depending on the achievability of the reference point. The formulation proposed allows different compensation degrees among the deviations to the reference values. It is proven that, in the achievable case, any optimal solution obtained is efficient, and, in the unachievable one, it is at least weakly efficient, although it is assured to be efficient if an augmentation term is added to the new formulation. Besides, we suggest an interactive algorithm where the new formulation is embedded. Finally, we show the empirical advantages of the new formulation by its application to both numerical problems and a real multiobjective optimization problem, for achievable and unachievable reference points.

AB In this paper, we discuss scheduling problems motivated by a real-world production setting found in 300-mm semiconductor wafer fabrication facilities (wafer fabs). Front opening unified pods (FOUPs) transfer wafers in 300-mm wafer fabs. Several orders can be grouped in one FOUP. We study lot and single item processing environments. The total weighted tardiness (TWT) and the weighted number of tardy orders (WNTO) objectives are considered. Mixed integer programming (MIP) formulations are presented for the scheduling problems. We prove that the researched scheduling problems are NP-hard. Grouping genetic algorithms (GGAs) are proposed to form the content of the FOUPs. We compare the performance of the GGAs with another GA from the literature available for the problem with TWT measure based on randomly generated problem instances. It turns out that the GGA outperforms the heuristic from the literature for both environments. For the WTNO measure, we assess the performance of the GGA approach using MIP formulations for small-size problem instances and a GA-based heuristic for large-size problem instances. Again, the GGA performs well with respect to solution quality and amount of computing time.

We compute contribution of risk factors to credit spreads of Chinese corporate bonds by establishing the unbalanced panel data model, identify the key factors impacting the size of credit spreads of corporate bonds. Knowledge extracted by data mining is helpful to investors for reasonable pricing of bonds and making rational investment decisions. When selecting variables, the unbalanced panel data model is used to calculate the Zero-volatility credit spreads, which are more accurate. We use term structure adjusted return of bond index as the systemic risk factor of corporate bond market, the three Fama/French systemic factors as the systemic risk factors of stock markets and idiosyncratic stock/bond volatility and idiosyncratic bond value-at-risk as the idiosyncratic risk factors. Empirical analysis of corporate bonds sampling China's listing Corporation issued and traded on Shanghai Stock Exchange from 2008 to 2011 shows that the size of credit spreads is mainly determined by the systemic risk factors of bond market, i.e. risk factors of stock market make very little contribution to the spread; the idiosyncratic risk factors also contribute. An interesting phenomenon is that we find that the relationship between idiosyncratic stock volatility and credit spread is negative, which is contrary to extant research while the relationship is positive and mainly focuses on impact of risk factors on credit spread of corporate bond.

AB The rapid development of social network theory provides a new perspective for the research on counter-terrorism, however, current research mostly relates to terrorists and terrorist organizations. Firstly, the "six-element" analysis method for terrorist activities based on social network is proposed in this paper, namely, a variety of sub-networks are constructed according to the correlation among the six elements-people, organization, time, location, manner and event. These sub-networks are assessed through using centrality analysis, cohesive subgroup analysis, spatial correlation analysis, invulnerability analysis and descriptive statistic analysis; the characteristics and laws of terrorist activities are revealed from several different perspectives. Then, the "six-element" analysis method is applied to conduct empirical research on "East Turkistan" terrorist activities since the founding of the People's Republic of China, so as to effectively identify core people and key organizations of the "East Turkistan" terrorist activity network, to assess the invulnerability of the "East Turkistan" terrorist network and to reveal the temporal and spatial distribution rules as well as the characteristics of the means and manners adopted in all previous terrorist activities. Lastly, the analysis results are interpreted qualitatively. This research can provide a basis for decision making and an analysis method for the identification of core terrorists and key terrorist organizations, determination of the key alert period, location of counter-terrorism and the early warning of the means of major terrorist activities.

AB This work addresses a new transportation problem in outbound logistics in the automobile industry: the finished-vehicle transporter routing problem (FVTRP). The FVTRP is a practical routing problem with loading constraints, and it assumes that dealers have deterministic demands for finished vehicles that have three-dimensional irregular shapes. The problem solution will identify optimal routes while satisfying demands. In terms of complex packing, finished vehicles are not directly loaded into the spaces of transporters; instead, loading patterns matching finished vehicles with transporters are identified first by mining successful loading records through virtual and manual loading test procedures, such that the packing problem is practically solved with the help of a procedure to discover loading patterns. This work proposes a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model for the FVTRP considering loading patterns. As a special class of routing models, the FVTRP is typically difficult to solve within a manageable computing time. Thus, an evolutionary algorithm is designed to solve the FVTRP. Comparisons of the proposed algorithm and a commercial MILP solver demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is more effective in solving medium- and large-scale problems. The proposed scheme for addressing the FVTRP is illustrated with an example and tested with benchmark instances that are derived from well-studied vehicle routing datasets.

AB Optimization of oil-imports portfolio has attracted considerable attention from corporate operators as well as government and its strategic planners. This paper proposes a methodology of oil-importing portfolio optimization based on the fundamental process of intelligent knowledge management (IKM). Centering on the maritime system, optimal solutions are derived for different risk scenarios. Specifically, three main steps are involved: formulating a multi-objective programming (MOP) model, integrating the composite risk exposure with domain knowledge, as well as knowledge acquisition on risk scenarios and influence of transportation risk. For illustration, optimization of the maritime structure of China's oil imports is performed to verify the practicability of the novel methodology. Experimental results suggest that the risk-adjusted factors' augmentation can spread the risk wider and eventually enhance risk optimization capability in the MOP model. With a given risk-adjusted factor, the influence of transportation risk on an optimal plan is simulated and analyzed. The paper uses the fundamental IKM process for transforming the data (rough knowledge) into intelligent knowledge (transformation from T1 to T2) in the empirical study on risk integration and optimization of oil-importing maritime system. It is helpful to explore hidden patterns. What's more, results suggest that it is necessary to highlight the influence of transportation risk in order to support decision makers from different domains to obtain more reasonable optimal solutions.

AB Previous studies have revealed that Internet search data is a new source of data that can be used to predict the stock market. In this new, data-driven research field, choosing a method for preprocessing data is crucial to achieving accurate prediction performance. This paper proposes a preprocessing method of Internet search data: composite leading search index (CLSI), which is composed of three steps: (a) keyword selection, (b) time difference measurement, and (c) leading index composition. We demonstrate the validity of CLSI by comparing this method's results with the results from search volume index (SVI), which is most commonly used in previous literatures. We build a time series model (TS) with error correction and support vector regression (SVR) for stock trend prediction, and combine into four models for comparison: SVI-TS, CLSI-TS, SVI-SVR, and CLSI-SVR. We test these four models in the context of the Chinese stock market, which interests more and more investors nowadays, and analyzed results in nine datasets: stable periods, peak periods and trough periods of Shanghai Composite Index, Shenzhen Composite Index, and Hushen 300 index respectively. The results show that using TS and SVR as forecasting models, CLSI performs better than SVI on majority of the test dataset while has almost the same performance with that of SVI on the remaining test dataset. It is to some extent convincing that CLSI is a more efficient preprocessing method of Internet search data for stock trend prediction.

AB The vulnerability assessment is important for earthquake prevention and mitigation. Since many criteria need to be considered during the evaluation process, it can be modeled as a multiple criteria decision making (MCDM) problem. This paper proposes an approach which integrates the results of different MCDM methods to provide regional earthquake vulnerability assessment. The key idea of this approach is to determine the most trustable MCDM method by calculating the weights of several MCDM methods using the Spearman's ranking correlation coefficients. The most trustable MCDM method is the one with the highest weight, which indicates that it has the strongest agreements with other MCDM methods, and is used to provide a final assessment using the combination of other MCDM methods. The proposed approach is applied to evaluate the earthquake vulnerability of 31 Chinese regions using six MCDM methods and eleven vulnerability evaluation indices. The results indicate that the proposed approach can integrate the inconsistent evaluation results of different MCDM methods and produce a comprehensive assessment of regional earthquake vulnerability.

AB We propose a novel mode-characteristic-based decomposition ensemble model for nuclear energy consumption forecasting. Our method is based on the principles of "data-characteristic-based modeling" and "decomposition and ensemble". The model improves on existing decomposition ensemble learning techniques (with "decomposition and ensemble") by using "data-characteristic-based modeling" to forecast the decomposed modes. Ensemble empirical mode decomposition is first used to decompose the original nuclear energy consumption data into a series of comparatively simple modes, reducing the complexity of the data. Then, the extracted modes are thoroughly analyzed to capture hidden data characteristics. These characteristics are used to determine appropriate forecasting models for each mode. Final forecasts are obtained by combining these predicted components using an effective ensemble tool, such as least squares support vector regression. For illustration and verification purposes, we have implemented the proposed model to forecast nuclear energy consumption in China. Our numerical results demonstrate that the novel method significantly outperforms all considered benchmarks. This indicates that it is a very promising tool for forecasting complex and irregular data such as nuclear energy consumption.

AB This paper deals with the problem of optimally controlling the service rates for the perishable inventory system at service facilities with impatient customers. We consider a finite capacity inventory system with Poisson demands and exponentially distributed service times. The maximum inventory level is fixed at . The ordering policy is policy, that is, whenever the inventory level drops to , an order for items is placed. The ordered items are received after a random time which is also distributed as exponential. The waiting customer independently reneges the system after an exponentially distributed amount of time. The items in the inventory have shelf life times that are assumed to follow an exponential distribution. Here we determine the service rates to be employed at each instant of time so that the long run total expected cost rate is minimized. The problem is modelled as a semi-Markov decision problem. The stationary optimal policy is computed using linear programming algorithm and the results are illustrated numerically.

AB In this article, we consider a continuous review perishable inventory system with service facility consisting of finite waiting hall and a single server. The primary customers arrive according to a Markovian arrival process. An arriving customer, who finds the waiting hall is full, is considered to be lost. The individual customer's unit demand is satisfied after a random time of service which is distributed as exponential. The life time of each item is assumed to be exponentially distributed. The items are replenished based on variable ordering policy. The lead time is assumed to have phase type distribution. After the service completion, the primary customer may decide either to join the secondary (feedback) queue, which is of infinite size, or leave the system according to a Bernoulli trial and the server decides to serve either for primary or feedback customer according to a Bernoulli trail. The primary and secondary service are at different counters. The service time for feedback customers is assumed to be independent exponential distribution. After the service completion for feedback customer, the server starts immediately for primary customer's service, whenever the inventory level and the primary customer level is positive, otherwise the server becomes idle for an exponential duration. If the primary customer level and inventory level becomes positive during the server idle period then he starts service for primary customer immediately. After completing his idle period, the server goes to secondary counter to serve for feedback customer, if any. The joint probability distribution of the system is obtained in the steady state. Important system performance measures are derived and the long-run total expected cost rate is also calculated. The results are illustrated numerically.

AB An intuitionistic fuzzy economic order quantity (EOQ) inventory model with backlogging is investigated using the score functions for the member and non-membership functions. The demand rate is varying with selling price and promotional effort (PE). A crisp model is formulated first. Then, intuitionistic fuzzy set and score function (or net membership function) are applied in the proposed model, considering selling price and PE as fuzzy numbers. To obtain the best inventory policy, ranking index method has been adopted, showing that the score function can maintain the ranking rule also. Moreover, optimization is made under the general fuzzy optimal (GFO) and intuitionistic fuzzy optimal (IFO) policy. Finally, a graphical illustration, numerical examples with sensitivity analysis and conclusion is made to justify the model.

ID QUALITY-CONTROL; NUMBER
AB In doing a six-sigma analysis of a process one must first determine the set of possible factors that potentially drive the response of interest. This stage of the the work, known as process mapping, is time consuming. Spending too much time on it wastes investigators and employees time. Yet, spending too little time may result in failing to uncover important factors that drive the process. We model this situation as a general coupon collector's problem with N distinct coupons, where the exact value of N is not known. Our objective is to devise effective strategies to minimize the total cost incurred due to sampling in addition to the cost of unidentified coupons when the collector stops sampling. We propose a policy based on an asymptotic analysis when N is large and prove that the proposed policy is asymptotically optimal. We also illustrate the effectiveness of this policy with numerical experiments.

AB A queueing model consisting of two multi-server service systems is considered. Primary customers arrive at a multi-server queueing system-1 having an infinite buffer. The input flow is described by a MAP (Markovian Arrival Process). The service time of a primary customer has a PH (Phase-type) distribution. Besides the primary customers, a MAP of interruptions arrives to the system. An interruption removes one of the primary customers from the service if the state (phase) of its PH service process does not belong to some given set of so called protected phases when an interruption is successful. The interrupted customer leaves the system permanently with some probability. With complementary probability, the interrupted primary customer moves for service to system-2. This system consists of K independent identical servers and has no buffer. If all K servers are busy at the moment of a primary customer interruption, this customer will be lost. Otherwise, this primary customer starts the service in an arbitrary idle server of system-2. It is assumed that the service time of a primary customer by a server of system-2 has a PH distribution. Upon completion of the service at system-2, the customer becomes priority customer. If, at the service completion moment, there are free servers at system-1, the priority customer immediately starts getting the service at system-1. It is assumed that the service time of a priority customer by a server of system-1 has a PH distribution and this service can not be interrupted. If, at the moment when the primary customer finished the service at system-2, there are no idle servers at system-1, this customer is placed into the finite buffer for priority customers of capacity K. The customers will be picked up for the service according to the FIFO discipline. When a server of system-1 becomes free, it takes for service a priority customer from this buffer, if any. Type-1 customers are picked-up from the infinite buffer only if the buffer for priority customers is empty at the service completion moment at system-1.
   Behavior of this system is described by a multi-dimensional Markov chain. Algorithms for checking ergodicity condition and computing the stationary distribution are presented. Formulas for computing important performance measures of the system are derived.

AB We consider two versions of bottleneck (or min-max) generalized assignment problem (BGAP) under capacity uncertainty: Task-BGAP and Agent-BGAP. A robust optimization approach is employed to study this issue. The decision maker's degree of risk aversion and the penalty weighting parameter are incorporated into the objective function. A state-of-the-art linearization method is introduced to deal with the mathematical model and find the solution scheme. Two penalties of weighting parameters that realize the trade-off between solution robustness and model robustness are obtained. Illustrative examples are presented with managerial implications highlighted for decision-making considerations.

AB In this paper, we study a multiperiod mean-variance portfolio optimization problem in the presence of proportional transaction costs. Many existing studies have shown that transaction costs can significantly affect investors' behavior. However, even under simple assumptions, closed-form solutions are not easy to obtain when transaction costs are considered. As a result, they are often ignored in multiperiod portfolio analysis, which leads to suboptimal solutions. To provide better insight for this complex problem, this paper studies a two-period problem that considers one risk-free and one risky asset. Whenever there is a trade after the initial asset allocation, the investor incurs a linear transaction cost. Through a mean-variance model, we derive the closed-form expressions of the optimal thresholds for investors to re-allocate their resources. These thresholds divide the action space into three regions. Some important properties of the analytical solution are identified, which shed light on solving multiperiod problems.

AB VoIP ("Voice Over Internet Protocol") is the transmission of voice communication through the Internet via IP-based telephony networks. VoIP has become very popular over recent years due to the cost advantages for consumers and businesses compared to the traditional telephony networks. Since it is deployed on packet-based networks, one of the major Quality of Service (QoS) concerns of VoIP technology is the average end-to-end connection delay. The objective of this paper is to present a queuing model for obtaining the end-to-end delay of a VoIP connection. The paper first describes all the partial delay components, and their mathematical formulations. Subsequently, based on all the partial delay components, a queuing model for the end-to-end delay of a VoIP connection is presented. The proposed queueing model is analyzed using a generalized stochastic Petri net (GSPN) model. From the GSPN model, we obtain numerical results for the end-to-end delay, which are presented graphically. The results are in accordance with the expected behavior of delay in a VoIP network.

AB The paper explores the implications of heterogeneous consumer response to advertising for the equilibrium strategies chosen by firms in a distribution channel. We solve a simple game theoretic model using a variation of consumers' Hotelling utility model for a decentralized and a coordinated channel. The key findings show that heterogeneity considerably affects the value of channel coordination. Overlooking heterogeneous responses to advertising can lead to either undercutting or overestimating channel coordination benefits. In particular, our results indicate that, in contrast to previous findings in the literature, channel coordination might result in higher consumer prices especially when the average response to brand advertising exceeds consumers' marginal disutility cost.

ID SERVICE INTERRUPTIONS
AB In this paper we discuss a queueing system with service interruption. The service gets interrupted due to different environmental factors. Here it is assumed that interruption due to only one factor is allowed at a time. Further we assume that while in interruption no other interruption befalls the system. Even though any number of interruptions can occur during the service of a customer, the maximum number of interruptions is restricted to a finite number K and if the number of interruptions exceeds the maximum, the customer leaves the system without completing service. The difference between the model under discussion and those considered earlier in literature is that the customer/server is unaware of the interruption until a random amount of time elapses from the moment interruption strikes. At the moment the interruption occurs, a random clock and a superclock start ticking. The interruption is identified only when the random clock is realized. The superclock measures the total interruption time during the service of a customer. On realization of superclock the customer goes out of the system without completing service. The kind of service to be started after the interruption depends on the environmental factor that caused the interruption. Here we first analyze the service process to find the response time and to compute the stability condition. The optimal values of K for a suitable cost function is investigated. Numerical investigations indicates the cost function as convex/increasing/decreasing in K.

AB Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) are autonomous wireless systems consists of a variety of collaborative sensor nodes forming a self-configuring network with or without any pre-defined infrastructure. The common challenges of a WSN are network connectivity, node mobility, energy consumption, data computation and aggregation at sensor nodes. In this paper we focus on intermittency in network connectivity due to mobility of sensor nodes. We propose a new mathematical model to capture a given entire WSN as is with intermittency introduced between the communication links due to mobility. The model involves open GI/G/1/N queuing networks whereby intermittency durations in communication links are captured in terms of mobility models. The analytical formulas for the performance measures such as average end-to-end delay, packet loss probability, throughput, and average number of hops are derived using the queuing network analyzer and expansion method for models with infinite- and finite-buffer nodes, respectively. For models with 2-state intermittency, we analyze the performance measures by classifying these models into three types: namely, model with intermittent reception, model with intermittent transmission and/or reception, and model with intermittent transmission. We extend the analysis to multi-state intermittency models. We demonstrate the gained insight of WSNs through extensive numerical results.

AB Online customer segmentation is a significant research topic of customer relationship management. Previous literatures mainly studied the differences between non-purchasers and purchasers, lacking further segmentation of online purchasers. There is still existing significant heterogeneity within purchaser-groups. This paper focuses on Chinese online purchaser segmentation based on large volume of real transaction data on Taobao.com, we firstly extracted and investigated Chinese online purchaser behavior indicators and classified them into six types by cluster analysis, these six categories are: economical purchasers, active-star purchasers, direct purchasers, high-loyalty purchasers, risk-averse purchasers and credibility-first purchasers; then we built an empirical model to estimate the sensitivity of each type of online purchasers to three mainstream promotion strategies (discount, advertising and word-of-mouth), and found that economical purchasers are the most sensitive to discount promotion; direct purchasers are the most sensitive to advertising promotion; active-star purchasers are the most sensitive to word-of-mouth promotion; finally, the implications of online purchaser classification for marketing strategies were discussed.

AB Trust plays an important role in commercial cloud environments. It is one of the biggest challenges of cloud technology. Trust enables users to select the best resources in a heterogeneous cloud infrastructure. We introduce a novel trust model based on past credentials and present capabilities of a cloud resource provider. Trust value is calculated using four parameters such as availability, reliability, turnaround efficiency, and data integrity. A trust management system is proposed implementing this trust model. The paper describes how a service level agreement is prepared combining quality of service requirements of user and capabilities of cloud resource provider. We also demonstrate that our proposed model performs better than the first in first out model and similar trust models.

AB Businesses today must maintain a laser-like focus on containing costs and increasing efficiencies in every possible way in order to generate profits and maintain competitiveness. Supply chain management (SCM) & optimization is a critical aspect of modern enterprises and an ever-green research area. IT dept plays a major role in the optimization of supply chains. This paper presents a critical review of IT methodologies for optimizing supply-driven chains which have complex inventory systems. The convergence of business unit and IT dept using state-of-art cloud technology is recently accepted as a solution to optimize such complicated supply chains. On the other hand, there is still ongoing debate on the choice of the model among private cloud, community cloud, public cloud and conventional Enterprise IT models. Specifically, it is not certain which model is the most appropriate for supply-driven enterprises. Google and Amazon argue that public cloud is a better choice from the perspective of resource management since public cloud provides the least elasticity. Business growth is the main objective of any enterprise. Resource Management is one of the parameters of business growth. Even though public cloud is an optimal model from the perspective of resource management, this paper states that community cloud is the most suitable model for supply-driven enterprises from the perspective of business growth. We conduct simulation experiments and demonstrate that community cloud is the optimal model to supply-driven enterprises.

AB We consider a multiserver Markovian queuing model where each server provides service only to one customer. Arrival of customers is according to a Poisson process and whenever a customer leaves the system after getting service, that server is also removed from the system. Here the servers are considered as an inventory that will be replenished according to the standard (s,S) policy. Behavior of this system is studied using a two dimensional QBD process. The condition for checking ergodicity, the steady state solutions and average inventory cycle time are obtained using matrix analytic methods. Also we have studied an optimization problem that minimizes the total cost induced by the waiting cost of arrivals, holding cost of the inventory of servers and ordering cost.

AB This paper considers a continuous review stochastic (s,S) inventory system with Poisson demand and exponentially distributed delivery time. The demands that occur during the stock out period or during the server vacation period enter into an orbit of infinite size. These orbiting demands retry to get satisfied by sending out signals so that the time durations are exponentially distributed. We consider two models which differ in the way that server go for vacation. The joint probability distribution of the inventory level, the number of demands in the orbit and the server status is obtained in the steady state case. Various system performance measures in the steady state is derived and the long-run total expected cost rate is calculated. Several numerical examples, which provide insight into the behaviour of the cost function, are presented.

AB We study a two-item two-warehouse periodic review inventory model that allows transshipment between warehouses and emergency orders. The model helps to determine two decisions: (i) the order up to levels for the two items at the two warehouses, and (ii) whether to accept a transshipment request from the other warehouse. The acceptance of a transshipment request in a warehouse depends on the time until the next review epoch and the inventory level of the warehouse. We propose a search procedure, which is a combination of greedy heuristics and a Lagrangian relaxation method, to minimize the total operating cost of the system. Numerical experiments reveal that optimality can be achieved using the proposed procedure. The time threshold to accept a transshipment request in a warehouse increases with the emergency shipment cost. In addition, the more inventory available in the warehouse the more likely for a transshipment request to be accepted.

The average expected cost function is formulated by trading off setup cost, purchasing cost, lead-time crashing cost, inventory cost and costs of lost sale and partial backordering. In this cost function, order quantity, reorder point and lead-time are decision variables. The above average expected cost function is analysed by calculus method in light of both distribution-free and known distribution function. Numerical example is illustrated to justify our proposed model.

AB In this paper, we show how ordering time can be used as a mechanism to mitigate the supply risks of the unreliable newsboy. We consider the situation where a firm has an option of placing a series of sequential orders such that a new order is placed only after the yield from the previous order is known and derive an optimal order quantity for each ordering stage. The effectiveness of our approach is assessed by comparing its expected cost with the expected cost of the conventional reliable newsboy problem. It is demonstrated that the adverse effect of supply side risks can be almost completely negated by adopting our approach when the combined purchasing and holding costs for a low cost supplier at an earlier stage are equal to those of a high cost supplier at the next stage. Computational experiments suggest that the sequential ordering policy performs better than a simultaneous ordering strategy when customer service level norms become stringent and inventory holding costs decrease.

AB This study investigates a production-inventory model considering system maintenance, variable setup costs, and trade credits. In production systems, manufacturers usually carry out system maintenance when systems are in an out-of-control state. We also consider setup costs because these costs may decrease over time, for example, when manufacturers effectively improve production efficiency because of the effect of the learning curve. The model considers trade credits because suppliers commonly provide credit periods to manufacturers. This study determines the optimal replenishment frequencies that minimize total costs. We provide lemmas for optimality, develop a piecewise nonlinear optimization algorithm to solve the problems described, and verify the model using a practical case in the automotive parts industry. Based on numerical experiments, we discuss how system parameters affect the decision behaviors of manufacturers. The results of this study can serve as references for business managers and administrators.

AB Our interest is in forecasting for call centres, and in particular out-of-hours call centres (OOHCC) which deal with patient requests for medical advice outside normal working hours. Planning needs accurate forecasts of incoming call volumes. These vary by hour, day, and season, and must account for calendar effects such as Christmas. Using historical data, we explain how to use simple regression models to forecast call volumes arriving on specified days, taking into account calendar effects. We then show how we forecast the pattern of arrivals of calls during a specified day. These result in predictions for volumes of calls arriving for each day of the year, and their pattern of arrival during the day. We show how simulation models may then be used for resource allocation, uncertainty analysis, and staff scheduling. The data are details of call numbers and queue lengths from all parts of the patient-advice process for around five years, for a call centre based in Newcastle-upon-Tyne. There are around 350,000 complete cases in total. The methods are easily extended to other kinds of call centre. We describe the impact Swine flu had on call volumes in the summer of 2009, and our reactions to amend models in order to maintain forecast quality.

TI Two substitutable perishable product disaster inventory systems

ID MODEL
AB A disaster inventory system is considered in which two substitutable items are stored for disaster management. In the event of disaster management, a particular product may become stock-out and the situation warrants that a demand for the particular product during its stock-out period may be substituted with another available similar product in the inventory. From the utility point of view, continuous review inventory models are quite appropriate in disaster inventory management. In this paper, a continuous review two substitutable perishable product disaster inventory model is proposed and analyzed. Since the inventory is maintained for disaster management, an adjustable joint reordering policy for replenishment is adopted. There is no lead time and the replenishment is instantaneous. For this model, some measures of system performance are obtained. The stationary behavior of the model is also considered. Numerical examples are also provided to illustrate the results obtained.

ID SELECTION; CRITERIA
AB In a typical project portfolio optimization problem, the decision makers would choose the optimal project portfolio from the candidates under the constraints of certain resources. However, in lots of real world examples, traditional approaches cannot perfectly solve the project portfolio optimization problems with unknown information about the importance of attributes. An innovative feature of this paper is to propose a stochastic multiattribute acceptability analysis (SMAA) to solve the multiattribute project portfolio optimization problems. SMAA includes a series of methods, which provide full ranks for a set of alternatives by exploring the weight space to make each alternative the most preferred one. Our proposed method provides feasible procedures to deal with the project portfolio optimization problems and, as an extension of traditional SMAA methods, expands the SMAA applications from the comparison of single alternatives to the comparison of sets of alternatives.

AB A queueing-inventory system, with the item given with probability gamma to a customer at his service completion epoch, is considered in this paper. Two control policies, (s,Q) and (s,S) are discussed. In both cases we obtain the joint distribution of the number of customers and the number of items in the inventory as the product of their marginals under the assumption that customers do not join when inventory level is zero. Optimization problems associated with both models are investigated and the optimal pairs (s,S) and (s,Q) and the corresponding expected minimum costs are obtained. Further we investigate numerically an expression for per unit time cost as a function of gamma. This function exhibit convexity property. A comparison with Schwarz et al. (Queueing Syst. 54:55-78, 2006) is provided. The case of arbitrarily distributed service time is briefly indicated.

We compare two different policies-one where the two classes of customers are treated exactly alike and the other where a threshold rationing policy is used. We prove that under certain conditions there is a sub-optimal rationing policy which yields a lower cost for the supplier and higher service levels for both the high priority and low priority customers than the optimal policy where the two customers are treated alike.

AB Due to the revolution in green manufacturing for the global market, Green Supply Chain Management (GSCM) concepts have become an important issue that can play a pivotal role in a company's competitive advantage and help strategic decision making. GSCM is a concept, by which companies assess their suppliers to improve the environmental performance of their products or production processes of the suppliers. The tide of globalization has also resulted in pressure on multinational firms to improve environmental performance. Due to the increasing realization of the importance of integrating environmental factors into assessing suppliers' performance, this study developed a model for analyzing the criteria and sub-criteria involved in the implementation of GSCM using an Interpretive Structural Modeling (ISM) framework. Finally, the proposed model is validated based on a case study involving textile manufacturing industry in southern part of India.

AB This paper documents a new series two-stage DEA modeling framework for credit risk evaluation in terms of operating performance efficiency and effectiveness that is implemented to a sample of listed Greek firms of basic resources and chemicals sector. In the series stages two types of DEA metrics are used: The first type is based on the range adjusted measure (RAM) whereas the second type is based on a common set of weights (CSW) of RAM. Performance inefficiency is uncovered in both performance dimensions, but the real problem of inefficiency of the sampled firms is a lower level of effectiveness, rather than operating performance efficiency. The operating efficiency is not correlated with effectiveness, and thus it seems that there is not a link between the performance at the operational (cost-oriented) and financial (profit-oriented) spaces of the firm. Therefore, sample firms should give more emphasis on their profit-oriented policies to ensure their success in the industry. The research framework may benefit not only Greek listed firms, but also firms in other countries to quantify their performance and improve their competitive advantages.

AB Timber extraction is based on two transportation modes-off-road and on-road-that are connected by a set of landing nodes. Forest operations planning that is oriented toward harvesting consists of concurrently locating a truck road network, designating landing/loading sites along that network, and allocating stands to specific harvest technologies (e.g., cable roads). In central Europe, this problem has, until recently, been solved primarily with rules of thumb. By contrast, only a few attempts, designed for plantation systems, have been made to find the mathematical optima. Here, we present a modeling approach to identify a minimal-cost solution for this problem of laying out truck roads and cable roads when the terrain is steep. This technique is based on a Mixed Integer Linear Programming formulation. Our approach is as good as or better than state-of-the-art methods. Here, the overall costs of harvesting and roading were decreased by about 7 % compared with techniques that called for a heuristic solution only. Depending upon parameter choices, we also determined that a computing time ranging from 4 min to 8 hrs was required when assessing a logging area of 4.3 km(2).

AB In this paper we present the solution to a weekly log-truck scheduling problem (LTSP) integrating the routing and scheduling of trucks where all goods are transported in full truckloads. We must take into account pick-up and delivery requirements, multiple products, inventory levels, and lunch breaks. The objective is to minimize the overall transportation cost including wait times and the empty and loaded distance traveled. Our solution is based on a two-phase approach. The first phase involves an integer linear program that determines the destinations of full truckloads. The second phase uses an implicit integer linear program based on an arc formulation to ensure that the trucks are routed and scheduled at a minimum cost. Experiments have been conducted using Cplex 12.4.0, and almost all instances were solved within six hours with a reasonable gap.

AB In a typical decision-making process, preference elicitation methods require a priori knowledge about the desired outcomes. It is expected that the decision maker (DM) has a rough idea of the alternatives or the production possibilities, and has a relatively clear idea of his/her preferences regarding the decision. For those DMs who do not have this general understanding, the determination of preferences (and/or targets for specific criteria) can be difficult, uncertain and may lead towards a suboptimal solution for the particular DM. In a typical planning process, a limited set of alternatives are generated by a professional. These are then evaluated using preference information. A more useful approach would be to use that preference information towards developing a more acceptable alternative. The method proposed in this article is an interactive system which first requires the DM to indicate their initial preference value for each criterion. Then a series of pre-determined goal programming functions generate a solution. The solutions are then compared simultaneously, so that the DM can understand how feasible the preferences are when used in the creation of alternative solutions. The DM is then asked to provide a minimum preference level guided by a comparison of the alternative solutions. By proceeding in an iterative fashion, the DM can adjust his/her preferences until the DM is satisfied with one of the generated solutions. A real forest planning situation is described as a case study of this method.

AB Policy makers need research based decision analysis models that include carbon sequestration and forest products in order to make policies that are both economically viable and effective. Forests and wood products have been identified as important mechanisms for carbon sequestration and storage. Policies often cover carbon sequestration but not product storage and substitution. Furthermore, many researchers have developed and published models on carbon management. However, a gap exists in operational level models that include product substitution. We developed a model to investigate optimal stand level management with competing objectives of maximizing soil expectation value, carbon storage in the forest, and carbon dioxide emission savings from product storage and substitution. Our purpose was to produce an accurate and usable analytical product for Southeastern U.S. foresters growing loblolly pine (Pinus taeda) in the presence of carbon policies. The decision variables were traditional stand level management variables: planting density, thinning timing and density, and rotation length. Over time these variables influence the proportion of wood going into pulp, chip-n-saw, and sawtimber where each of these classes has an expected use (carbon storage) life. Compromise programming was employed to solve the multiple-objective problem and to demonstrate the tradeoffs between the competing objectives. This type of model demonstrates a practical method for comparing tradeoffs associated with adjusting forest management for a carbon market. The difference in costs among objectives is important for decision makers considering climate change policies, as it represents the minimum value a rational landowner would accept to sequester a unit of carbon.

AB Companies that operate a commodity delivery service, lumber for instance, often own trucks to ship from a warehouse to their customers. One of these companies may consider purchasing new trucks to reduce operation costs, when operating new trucks is cheaper than operating old ones. That is, a company can save on future operational expenditures at the cost of purchasing new trucks. Once new trucks have been bought, the fleet consists of two sub-fleets: the subfleet of new and the subfleet of old trucks. The cheaper operation [currency units/min] of new trucks makes them preferable to old trucks. Thus, old trucks start servicing orders only when all new trucks are busy. For a given time horizon, the optimal cost of the project is a trade-off between the times serviced with old trucks, new trucks, and the cost of the new trucks to be purchased. This article puts forward a method to determine the number of new trucks to purchase that maximizes the expected present value of the project that applies to full payload deliveries. It uses historical information on hour-specific expected intensities of delivery requests and delivery services. Our approach can incorporate restrictions preventing deliveries to specific customers during certain time windows.

AB Harvesting plans for Canadian logging companies tend to cover wider territories than before. Long transportation distances for the workers involved in logging activities have thus become a significant issue. Often, cities or villages to accommodate the workers are far away. A common practice is thus to construct camps close to the logging regions, containing the complete infrastructure to host the workers. The problem studied in this paper consists in finding the optimal number, location and size of logging camps. We investigate the relevance and advantages of constructing additional camps, as well as expanding and relocating existing ones, since the harvest areas change over time. We model this problem as an extension of the Capacitated Facility Location Problem. Economies of scale are included on several levels of the cost structure. We also consider temporary closing of facility parts and particular capacity constraints that involve integer rounding on the left hand side. Results for real-world data and for a large set of randomly generated instances are presented.

AB Fuel management and suppression preparedness planning are elements of forest fire management that are strongly interrelated with one another. Despite this interrelation, previous forest fire management optimization models have tended to consider these components in isolation from one another. Here we present an integer programming model that incorporates both fuel management and suppression preparedness decisions, thus providing an integrated planning framework. A series of hypothetical test landscapes are used to demonstrate the model's functionality with easily interpretable results. A number of possible extensions to the model formulation are also discussed.

AB We calculate expected bare land values, assuming forestry is the highest and best land use, using a real options methodology with stochastic mean-reverting timber and carbon prices. Land values relect the contribution of both timber as well as carbon stored in three separate pools-the forest, harvested wood products, and emissions avoided by using wood versus carbon-intensive substitute materials. Land values reflect one of three sequestration scenarios that vary the percentages of carbon sequestered in the three pools relative to the carbon sequestered in the forest just prior to the harvest activity. At harvest time, the value of the carbon sequestered in the three pools determines if the forest owner retains income gained from the sale of carbon credits, or must purchase credits to offset emissions associated with the harvest activity. A case study involving a hypothetical western Washington Douglas-fir stand suggests that carbon sequestration may be a significant income contribution for forest owners if the three carbon pools are recognized as credible offsets. However, the income contribution is sensitive to the amount of credit realized for carbon sequestered in each of the pools. The analysis demonstrates the significance of including carbon sequestered in the three separate pools when designing carbon offset policies.

AB Spatially explicit harvest scheduling models optimize the layout of harvest treatments to best meet management objectives such as revenue maximization subject to a variety of economic and environmental constraints. A few exceptions aside, the mixed-integer programming core of every exact model in the literature requires one decision variable for every applicable prescription for a management unit. The only alternative to this "brute-force" method has been a network approach that tracks the management pathways of each unit over time via four sets of binary variables. Named after their linear programming-based aspatial predecessors, Models I and II, along with Model III, which has no spatial implementation, each of these models rely on static volume and revenue coefficients that must be calculated pre-optimization. We propose a fundamentally different approach that defines stand volumes and revenues as variables and uses difference equations and Boolean algebra to transition forest units from one planning period to the next. We show via three sets of computational experiments that the new model is a computationally promising alternative to Models I and II.

In this article, we describe the current status of research on the application of OR methods to forestry and a number of research challenges or open questions that we believe will be of interest to both researchers and practitioners. The areas covered include strategic, tactical and operational planning, fire management, conservation and the use of OR to address environmental concerns. The paper also considers more general methodological areas that are important to forestry including uncertainty, multiple objectives and hierarchical planning.

AB In this paper, we develop a mixed integer linear model for a practical multi-facility wood-procurement planning problem using a cut-to-length (CTL) bucking system. This forest management problem is difficult to solve since it integrates the forest bucking problem and the multi-facility supply planning problem. A priority-list approach was used to generate adequate bucking patterns in the Eastern Canadian context. The model provides decision support with respect to how to harvest the different cut-blocks according to the bucking priority list used, and in what quantities harvested logs should be transported to sawmills. It aims to minimize the nonlinear harvesting cost, the transportation cost, and the inventory cost and to maximize the product value (i.e., profit maximization). The harvesting cost considers the nonlinearity of the harvester productivity function, which is an important aspect of the decision-making process in forest management. The model was used to compare the current bucking scenario to two new possibilities. These scenarios allow us to investigate the gains and losses that arise from the use of different bucking aggregations. Specifically, we consider the impact on the number of different log types per block and thus on the associated harvesting cost. Moreover, we aim to better understand the cost/benefit trade-offs of a more complex decision structure in a Canadian wood-procurement context. The results of our scenario tests showed that forest bucking aggregation (the current practice) significantly reduces the company's profit. A simple bucking disaggregation that does not increase the operational cost can improve the outcome.

AB We study a problem of integrating the supply chain of roundwood with the supply chain of forest biomass. The developed optimization model is a multiperiod, multicommodity network planning problem with multiple sources of supply, i.e., harvest areas, and multiple types of destinations, i.e., sawmills, pulp mills, and heating plants. This paper presents an extension of previous work where the set of harvest areas was given and market prices for raw materials had linear relationship with corresponding volumes. In this paper, the assumption of predefined areas is removed, and we must make the selection of harvest areas. Instead of using a traditional sequential approach to first select areas and then determine the prices, we present a new synchronous approach that can jointly choose areas and define price levels for different assortments at those chosen supply points. We test the possible settings of discretized price and use sensitivity analysis to evaluate how the variation of fixed cost concerning log forwarding at each supply point affects the wood procurement decisions. A case study from Sweden is used to analyze the market prices in an integrated market. The computational results also highlight the advantage of the proposed synchronous approach over the sequential one in both solution quality and solution time.

AB We consider the important problem of medium term forest planning with an integrated approach considering both harvesting and road construction decisions in the presence of uncertainty modeled as a multi-stage problem. We give strengthening methods that enable the solution of problems with many more scenarios than previously reported in the literature. Furthermore, we demonstrate that a scenario-based decomposition method (Progressive Hedging) is competitive with direct solution of the extensive form, even on a serial computer. Computational results based on a real-world example are presented.

AB Forest harvest scheduling is a complicated management exercise because of the diverse and competing uses of forest resources, such as economic productivity, recreation and flora and fauna sustainability. In an effort to ensure the long-term viability of forest resources, restrictions are typically placed on the size of harvest areas, green-up intervals and proximity between disturbed areas in the United States. In order to satisfy consumer demands and maintain spatial and temporal restrictions, forest planners rely widely on optimization models to develop harvest schedules. A problematic element of work to date, however, is that spatial information relied upon in such analysis is typically uncertain in many ways, particularly spatial location and harvest unit boundaries. This paper develops new optimization models that explicitly account for spatial uncertainty in harvest scheduling. Application results demonstrate the effectiveness of this new perspective, enabling potential spatial uncertainty impacts to be better understood in management planning.

Although the title includes both "manufacturing" and "service" operations, the main emphasis is on manufacturing. The term "service system operations" is intended to refer mainly to functions that are supportive of manufacturing system operations. The volume includes thirteen state-of-the art articles that can be classified in three categories: stochastic modeling and analysis for design and optimization of manufacturing systems; production planning, management, and control; and analytical approaches to supply chain management.

AB In manufacturing systems, batch building processes are very common, as goods are often transported or processed in batches and must therefore be collected before these transport or processing steps can occur. In this paper, we present a method for the performance analysis of general batch building processes in material flow systems under the timeout and capacity rules. The proposed model allows for stochastic collecting times and incorporates no restrictions with respect to the number of arriving units and their interarrival times. The accuracy of the discrete-time approach is demonstrated by comparing this approach with a discrete-event simulation model in continuous-time. Subsequently, the model is applied to two cases: a transportation case from the health care industry and the process of building a batch for a batch processor.

AB This paper deals with the performance evaluation of production lines in which well defined machine start/stop control policies are applied.
   A modeling approach has been developed in order to reduce the complexity of a two-machine one-buffer line where a specific control policy, called "restart policy", is adopted. The restart policy exercises control over the start/stop condition of the first machine: when the buffer gets full and, as a consequence, the first machine is forced to stop production (i.e., it is blocked), the control policy keeps the first machine in an idle state until the buffer becomes empty again. The rationale behind this policy is to reduce the blocking frequency of the first machine, i.e. the probability that a blockage occurs on the first machine due to the buffer filling up. Such a control policy is adopted in practice when outage costs (e.g., waste production) are related to each restart of the machine.
   The two-machine one-buffer line with restart policy (RP line) is here modeled as a continuous time Markov process so as to consider machines having different capacities and working in an asynchronous manner. The mathematical RP model is described along with its analytical solution. Then, the most critical line performance measures are derived and, finally, some numerical examples are reported to show the effects of such a policy on the blocking frequency of the first machine.

AB We consider the buffer content of a fluid queue or storage process. The buffer content varies in a way that depends on the state of an underlying three-state Markov process. In state 0 the buffer content increases at a rate alpha(x) that is a function of the current buffer level x; in states 1 and 2 it decreases linearly, with different speeds. We study the steady-state buffer content, by using level crossing theory and by exploiting relations between the fluid queue and queues with instantaneous input and/or output.

AB Continuous material flow systems operating in bulk port marine terminals give rise to networks of mineral flows through nodes experiencing random stoppages. Material arrives at the system via trains and departs from the system via ships. Operational aspects of the material flow are quite varied and complicated. Therefore, a decomposition approximation method is proposed to study the steady-state behavior of the system to produce performance measures such as the long run pile levels, down time probabilities and the system throughput. Pseudo failure and repair rates of the subsystems are obtained and the subsystems are studied within an iterative algorithm. Numerical examples are provided.

AB The optimization of stochastic Discrete Event Systems (DESs) is a critical and difficult task. The search for the optimal system configuration (optimization problem) requires the assessment of the system performance (simulation problem), resulting in a simulation-optimization problem. In the past ten years, a noticeable research effort has been devoted to this area. Recently, mathematical programming has been proposed to integrate simulation and optimization for multi-stage open queueing networks. This paper proposes the application of this approach to closed queueing networks. In particular, the optimal pallet allocation problem is tackled through linear mathematical programming models for simulation-optimization.

AB This paper presents stochastic models for multi-tier warehouse systems that handle unit load transactions using autonomous vehicle-based technology. In this system, self-powered autonomous vehicles carry out unit-load transactions by moving along rails within a tier and using lifts or conveyors for vertical movement between tiers. We develop semi-open queuing network models to evaluate congestion effects in processing storage and retrieval transactions in this system. The queuing network is evaluated using a decomposition-based approach. The queuing model provides design insights on the effect of vehicle interference and vertical transfer mechanism on various system performance measures of interest. Insights from such studies can be especially useful during the conceptualization stage of warehouses that use autonomous vehicle technology.

AB The problem of optimal workload allocation in closed queueing network models with multi-server exponential infinite capacity workstations and finite capacity state dependent queueing models is examined. The processing rates (i.e. service times) of jobs in the queueing system are the main focus. State dependent queues are appropriate for modeling the transportation and material transfer of the customers and products within the system. By combining these two types of queues, we can model the processing of jobs or customers at service stations and also the material handling transfer of job and customers between these stations. Because the environment is a closed queueing network model, it allows for the dynamic interaction of the jobs and customers in the optimal workload allocation values. This combination of queues and optimal search process provides a broad range of potential applications in manufacturing and service type design operations where the travel time between workstations is important. Conveyors, automated-guided vehicle systems (AGVS), and fork lift trucks are utilized to show the full range of material handling component systems.

AB In this paper, we study the capacity flexibility problem of a maintenance service provider, who is running a repair shop and is responsible for the availability of numerous specialized systems which contain a critical component that is prone to failure. Upon a critical component failure, the component is sent to the repair shop and the service provider is responsible for the repair as well as the down-time costs resulting from the system unavailability. In order to decrease the down-time costs, the repair shop keeps an inventory for the critical components, such that a failed critical component can be replaced with a spare one immediately, if it is available. The component inventory stock level and the repair shop capacity level decisions have to be taken jointly by the service provider. The shop floor manager resorts to two different capacity modes in order to make use of capacity flexibility. First one is the single-level capacity mode, in which the capacity level is fixed and is the only capacity related decision. The best results in this mode serve as a reference to the two-level capacity mode, in which there are low (permanent) and high (permanent plus contingent) capacity levels. In this mode, the permanent capacity is always available in the shop, whereas the deployment of the contingent capacity is decided at the start of each period based on the number of components waiting to be repaired in the shop. The relevant capacity decisions of this mode are the permanent and contingent capacity levels, the period length and the states (in terms of number of failed components waiting) where the contingent capacity is deployed. We develop quantitative models based on queuing theory that integrate the inventory level decision with the capacity related decisions for the repair shop, in each of the two capacity modes, in order to minimize the total cost rate of the service provider. Our numerical results suggest that two-level capacity mode can bring substantial savings compared to the best fixed capacity mode and these savings are mostly resulting from lower repair shop capacity usage. Moreover, we find that the system, in most cases, chooses the shortest period length possible, indicating the overarching importance of a fast response to the system state. The system switches to the high capacity mode if the spare part stock is just one or two, then it uses a quite high contingent capacity level, in order to avoid out of stock. If contingent capacity costs are high, system chooses a high level of permanent capacity to prevent frequent capacity switches.

AB We investigate the structural properties of a finite horizon, discrete time single product inventory rationing problem, where we allow random replenishment (production) opportunities. In contrast to the standard models of dynamic capacity control in revenue management or production/inventory systems, we assume that the demand/production rates are not known with certainty but lie in some interval. To address this uncertainty, we formulate a robust stochastic dynamic program and show how the structural properties of the optimal policy propagate to the robust counterpart of the problem. Further, we explore how the optimal policy changes with respect to the uncertainty set. We also show that our results can be extended to certain alternative robust formulations.

ID SERVICE-LEVEL CONSTRAINTS; SUPPLY CHAINS; LARGE DEVIATIONS; OPTIMAL

AB This paper tackles linear programming problems with data uncertainty and applies it to an important inventory control problem. Each element of the constraint matrix is subject to uncertainty and is modeled as a random variable with a bounded support. The classical robust optimization approach to this problem yields a solution with guaranteed feasibility. As this approach tends to be too conservative when applications can tolerate a small chance of infeasibility, one would be interested in obtaining a less conservative solution with a certain probabilistic guarantee of feasibility. A robust formulation in the literature produces such a solution, but it does not use any distributional information on the uncertain data. In this work, we show that the use of distributional information leads to an equally robust solution (i.e., under the same probabilistic guarantee of feasibility) but with a better objective value. In particular, by exploiting distributional information, we establish stronger upper bounds on the constraint violation probability of a solution. These bounds enable us to "inject" less conservatism into the formulation, which in turn yields a more cost-effective solution (by 50 % or more in some numerical instances). To illustrate the effectiveness of our methodology, we consider a discrete-time stochastic inventory control problem with certain quality of service constraints. Numerical tests demonstrate that the use of distributional information in the robust optimization of the inventory control problem results in 36-54 % cost savings, compared to the case where such information is not used.

AB We investigate the option of keeping dedicated stocks at customer sites in addition to stock kept at some central location as a tool for applying service differentiation in spare parts supply. We study the resulting two-echelon system in a multi-item setting, both under backordering and under the use of emergency shipments (equivalent to lost sales for the inventory system). In an extensive computational experiment, we show that dedicated stocks have significant added value: the approach results in clear savings compared to a strategy of providing all customers with uniform service. Furthermore, the savings found with dedicated stocks are close to those with critical level policies, with dedicated stocks usually being much easier to implement in practice.

AB The paper addresses a problem of inventory control in a two-echelon retailer-customer setting. The problem incorporates the reputation of the retailer as a key factor influencing its policy. The retailer's reputation depends on the degree to which past demand was satisfied. In turn, the reputation impacts the distribution of future demand. The optimality conditions developed by means of a perturbation analysis technique enable an optimal base-stock policy, in which the current level of base-stock depends on the retailer's current reputation.

ID STOCHASTIC LEAD TIMES; MODEL; POLICIES
AB This paper is concerned with the analysis of periodic-review order-up-to inventory systems with backorders in which stochastic replenishment order crossovers may be observed, i.e., where it is possible that orders arrive in a different sequence to that in which they were issued due to high stochastic lead time fluctuations. This may be the case whenever sequentially placed orders are processed on parallel replenishment systems with independent stochastic processing times, and multiple orders may be open at the same time. Following the widespread tendency in the manufacturing industry to reduce order sizes and thus increase order frequency while parts and materials are replenished from distant sources, these conditions are nowadays met in many real-world processes. Such systems typically use regular order intervals, e.g. to enable joint replenishment of various item positions. In this paper, the concept of effective lead times is elaborated as a methodological basis for analyzing periodic replenishment processes that may exhibit order crossover. It is compared with the existing concept of outstanding orders. Based on this, formulae are developed to give an exact analysis of three essential performance indicators of a periodic-review order-up-to inventory system with independent stochastic lead times.

AB Socially Responsible Service Operations Management (SRSOM) can be defined as managerial activities to design and control (or optimize) various service operations that involve (or integrate) social responsibility toward legal, ethical, and environmental concerns. We propose a framework of research on SRSOM from the perspective of the service triad: target market, service concept, and service delivery system design choices. Unlike conventional service operations management, SRSOM focuses on: (1) non-voluntary citizens rather than voluntary customers as the main target group; (2) the provision of a general necessary service to citizens as the service concept; and (3) effectiveness and responsibility rather than efficiency as the service delivery system design choice. We also provide an overview of the related research on SRSOM published over the past 20 years, and attempt to place the seven papers shown in this collection in the proposed framework. While the current literature on SRSOM is limited, the number of papers has been steadily increasing. We hope that this paper will lead to further research on SRSOM among researchers and practitioners in related fields.

AB We propose an optimization model for patient delivery and medical resource allocation with capacity restrictions. Our model considers the severity of the victims' injuries in the initial search and rescue period and their survival probabilities, which decrease proportionally with the elapsed time. We develop a mixed integer programming model to select the location and network flow of an on-site clinic for supporting first-aid treatment near disaster areas. We also build a model of a general hospital as an objective function to maximize the number of patients whose survival probability exceeds the marginal level. Our model also considers patients waiting at the on-site clinic and hospital. We apply our optimization approach in a case study with data from a department store collapse in South Korea. Our computational results will facilitate future studies of logistics to support wounded victims of disasters.

AB Unlike ordinary outpatient clinics, an emergency care center sees a variety of patients with diverse diseases and injuries of different levels of severity. Since patients who are in a critical condition face serious consequences, target waiting times must be determined based on patient acuity levels. To reflect the special situation in emergency care centers included in this study, patient flows are formulated using an open Jackson network with multiple patient classes. This paper is unique because of the integration of pooling and prioritizing patient classes with the open Jackson network. In particular, a hybrid priority model is presented in which a first-come-first-served discipline is applied in some processes and a priority discipline is applied in other processes in the open Jackson network, in order to minimize waiting times for patients with more urgent concerns. A case study based on actual data from an emergency care center demonstrates that the proposed model of pooling and prioritizing patient classes is effective in decreasing waiting times for higher-priority classes without substantially sacrificing those for lower-priority classes.

AB Identifying the optimal screening strategies for breast cancer, the second leading cause of female cancer deaths in the US, is a major societal problem creating much controversy. The optimal screening strategies significantly depend on the sensitivity and specificity of the screening modality used. While the current state-of-the-art screening technology is mammography, its sensitivity or specificity may increase over time, or mammography may be replaced by another technology such as tomosynthesis in the near future. The purpose of this study is to identify the optimal use of the next generation of breast cancer screening modalities, whose sensitivity and specificity in clinical practice are either yet unknown or keep improving over time. Contrary to the prior literature that focuses on finding the optimal screening policy for given sensitivity and specificity values, we take an inverse optimization approach and focus on finding the range of sensitivity and specificity values, for which a given screening policy is optimal. To replicate breast cancer progression in the US population under various screening policies, we develop a parametric Partially Observable Markov Chain (POMC) model, which accounts for unobservable and age-specific disease progression, age-specific mortality, and the possibility of detecting cancer without a screening exam (either via self-detection or a clinical breast exam). We then formulate a nonlinear program (NLP) to identify the range of sensitivity and specificity values that optimize a particular screening policy. We show that this NLP is nonconvex for some parameter values, and hence difficult to solve. We prove several structural properties of the model, and by exploiting these properties, we propose a complete solution algorithm for this problem. We use real data in our numerical analysis and show that with the current technology, biennial breast cancer screening is slightly better than annual screening for the average-risk population. We also find that an improvement only in sensitivity (but not in specificity) will not change the current optimal policy. Furthermore, we characterize the lost potential quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) due to suboptimal practice, and show that biennial screening is more robust than annual screening in the sense that it results in fewer lost QALYs due to choosing a suboptimal screening policy. Given that the design of multicenter clinical trials may be prohibitively expensive and lengthy, our findings may be especially valuable to policymakers in deciding about the optimal use of an emerging breast cancer screening modality, and adapting a new technology in different settings.

DE Vaccines; Supply chain; Cold chain; Cold storage device; Device design
AB A major priority in many low and middle income countries is the eradication of infectious diseases through an effective vaccination program. However, the lack of reliable infrastructure, equipment and support often prove to be significant barriers in such countries. In particular, unreliable electric power and refrigeration equipment are major concerns and this has prompted research into the development of passive cold storage devices (PCDs) that are not dependent on electric power and can maintain cold temperatures for extended periods of time using a passive medium such as ice. The development of PCDs is in its early stages, and there are many open questions including how they should be sized, the interaction between price and device size, and how often they should be replenished. So far, these types of questions have not been systematically analyzed anywhere in the research literature, and this paper describes a model to address these issues in order to better guide the development of PCDs in the near future. This paper examines actual use cases with real data from a representative country, and presents a model that captures the various tradeoffs that must be considered in developing a suitable PCD while providing guidance on what would constitute a useful, robust and economical design.

ID FACILITY LOCATION; CAPACITY EXPANSION; UNCERTAINTY; NETWORK
AB In this paper, we study the optimal location decision for a network of alternative fuel stations (AFS) servicing a new market where the demand rate for the refueling service can be learned over time. In the presence of demand learning, the firm needs to make a decision, whether to actively learn the market through a greater initial investment in the AFS network or defer the commitment since an overly-aggressive investment often results in sub-optimal AFS locations. To illustrate this trade-off, we introduce a two-stage location model, in which the service provider enters the market by deploying a set of stations in the first stage under uncertainty, and has the option to add more stations in the second stage after it learns the demand. The demand learning time (length of the first stage) is endogenously determined by the service provider's action in the first stage. To solve this problem, we develop an efficient solution method that provides a framework to achieve a desired error rate of accuracy in the optimal solution. Using numerical experiment, we study the trade-off between active learning and deferred commitment in AFS deployment strategy under different market characteristics. Further, we find that the lack of planning foresight typically results in an over-commitment in facility investment while the service provider earns a lower expected profit.

AB This paper presents a methodology of measuring greenhouse gas emissions (mainly CO2) for the transportation sector and illustratively applies it in Korea. The transportation sector is one of the most critical sectors concerning environmental pollution and represents about 20 percent of the yearly total greenhouse gas emissions for the energy sector in Korea. In spite of the increasing importance of the transportation sector in the eco-environment, current methodologies to analyze greenhouse gas emissions use a Tier 1 method, which is the simplest type among the methodologies recommended by IPCC guidelines. For a new methodology, we consider characteristics of transportation modes and operational environments in Korea. The proposed methodology can analyze the amount of greenhouse gas emissions for each transport mode and integrate it through transportation environments. It also provides a decision-making tool for governments to make transportation polices. As a result, the Korean government can manage the transportation sector in an eco-friendly manner and improve the national eco-environment.

AB Whether in-kind or cash, coordinated help organizations such as the American Red Cross, count on donations to help those in need when and after disasters happen. Yet, it has been observed that the type (in-kind versus cash) and the quality of donations largely impact the success of meeting urgent demand in humanitarian operations. In particular, unsolicited items hamper the synchronization of logistical operations and hence may create more problems than solutions. This research sheds light on the behavioral and decision making aspects of a donor while developing analytical models of how that behavior can be influenced by soliciting a minimum amount of cash donation, which in turn mitigates the negative impact of unsolicited items. We investigate the literature on donor psychology and feed those extant findings to the analytical model. We provide explicit expressions for the optimal solicitation amount and the impact of that amount on maximizing the donor's likelihood to donate cash, as opposed to in-kind items. Also provided are some execution insights through extensive sensitivity analysis.

ID HEURISTIC ORDERINGS; ALGORITHM
AB We address the examination timetabling problem proposed in the second International Timetabling Competition (ITC2007). This paper presents new preprocessing stages and an improved mixed integer mathematical model. An exam-based conflict graph in which edges represent incompatibilities between exams is used. The preprocessing stages make use of the graph, together with hard constraints and room capacities, to reveal implicit constraints. Results show that the new preprocessing stages increase up to 106 % the number of conflict constraints an have more than doubled the size of the maximum clique. The improved mixed integer model comprises fewer constraints and is therefore more memory-efficient than the model presented after the competition. We propose valid inequalities based on cliques and a Data-dependent dual-feasible function to enhance our model. We run the tests on the twelve instances presented in the competition and the Yeditepe instances. The problem contains several criteria, which were also tested individually to help end users decide their respective importance. When our model and the original model are compared on the different instances, results show that the improved model yields better results for the majority of the cases and uses less memory.

AB This paper studies an allocation procedure for coalitional games with veto players. The procedure is similar to the one presented by Arin and Feltkamp (J Math Econ 43:855-870, 2007), which is based on Dagan et al. (Games Econ Behav 18:55-72, 1997). A distinguished player makes a proposal that the remaining players must accept or reject, and conflict is solved bilaterally between the rejector and the proposer. We allow the proposer to make sequential proposals over several periods. If responders are myopic maximizers (i.e. consider each period in isolation), the only equilibrium outcome is the serial rule of Arin and Feltkamp (Eur J Oper Res 216:208-213, 2012) regardless of the order of moves. If all players are fully rational, the serial rule still arises as the unique subgame perfect equilibrium outcome if the order of moves is such that stronger players respond to the proposal after weaker ones.

AB In this study, we propose a single server retrial queueing system with balking, second optional service and single vacation. At the arrival epoch, if the server is busy, the arriving job join the orbit or balks the system whereas if the server is free, then the arriving job starts its service immediately. For each job, the server provides two phases of service. All the jobs demand the first essential service, whereas only some of the jobs demand for the second optional service. If the system is empty, then the server becomes inactive and begins a single vacation. If server comes back from the vacation, it does not go for another vacation even if the system is still empty at that time. The steady state distributions of the server state and the number of jobs in the orbit are obtained along with other performance measures. The effects of various parameters on the system performance are analyzed numerically. A general decomposition law for this retrial queueing system is established.

AB We investigate a periodic review inventory system with demand that is either a Brownian motion or a Poisson process and with costs that accrue in continuous time over the period (and not at the end of the period). We find explicit expressions for the expected inventory costs and for the optimality equation. On the basis of these expressions, a simple search can be designed to obtain the optimal order-up-to level. In addition, we develop a new distribution function with a closed-form quantile function to approximate this level. The approximation can be adjusted to consider lead time. Numerical examples show that the suggested approximation produces substantially lower deviations from the optimal solution compared with approximations recommended in the literature.

AB Linear optimization problems are investigated that have random parameters in their constraints. In constructing a robust solution , we control the risk arising from violations of the constraints. This risk is measured by set-valued risk measures, which extend the usual univariate coherent distortion (=spectral) risk measures to the multivariate case. To obtain a robust solution in variables, the linear goal function is optimized under the restrictions holding uniformly for all parameters in a -variate uncertainty set. This set is built from uncertainty sets of the single constraints, each of which is a weighted-mean trimmed region in and can be efficiently calculated. Furthermore, a possible substitution of violations between different constraints is investigated by means of the admissable set of the multivariate risk measure. In the case of no substitution, we give an exact geometric algorithm, which possesses a worst-case polynomial complexity. We extend the algorithm to the general substitutability case, that is, to robust polyhedral optimization. The consistency of the approach is shown for generally distributed parameters. Finally, an application of the model to supervised machine learning is discussed.

AB Outranking relations such as produced by the Electre I or II or the Tactic methods are based on a concordance and non-discordance principle that leads to declaring that an alternative is "superior" to another, if the coalition of attributes supporting this proposition is "sufficiently important" (concordance condition) and if there is no attribute that "strongly rejects" it (non-discordance condition). Such a way of comparing alternatives is rather natural and does not require a detailed analysis of tradeoffs between the various attributes. However, it is well known that it may produce binary relations that do not possess any remarkable property of transitivity or completeness. The axiomatic foundations of outranking relations have recently received attention. Within a conjoint measurement framework, characterizations of reflexive concordance-discordance relations have been obtained. These relations encompass those generated by the Electre I and II methods, which are non-strict (reflexive) relations. A different characterization has been provided for strict (asymmetric) preference relations such as produced by Tactic. In this paper we briefly review the various kinds of axiomatizations of outranking relations proposed so far in the literature. Then we analyze the relationships between reflexive and asymmetric outranking relations in a conjoint measurement framework, consolidating our previous work. Co-duality plays an essential rle in our analysis. It allows us to understand the correspondence between the previous characterizations. Making a step further, we provide a common axiomatic characterization for both types of relations. Applying the co-duality operator to concordance-discordance relations also yields a new and interesting type of preference relation that we call concordance relation with bonus. The axiomatic characterization of such relations results directly from co-duality arguments.

AB Nowadays, the integration of sustainability into supply chain management (SCM) is a key issue for ensuring corporate competitiveness in face of dynamic ecological and social environments. This paper reviews 185 journal publications of the last 20 years that formalize issues related to sustainable supply chain management (SSCM) in quantitative models. In a content analysis, modeling and SCM characteristics as well as sustainability and SSCM constructs are elaborated. The models are assessed numerically by counting frequencies of occurrence and by clustering the paper sample according to selected characteristics. The findings indicate that SSCM models predominantly focus on deterministic approaches and the integration of environmental aspects of sustainability while neglecting stochastic modeling techniques and the consideration of social factors. By now, comprehensive modeling approaches are most often employed on intra-organizational levels whereas broader application areas are assessed by less complex models. The integration of pressures and incentives of external stakeholders or the formalization of sustainable supplier management and sustainability risks are identified as future research perspectives. Furthermore, the interrelationships between the triple bottom line dimensions are to be scrutinized in greater detail in order to avoid focused optimization of selected sustainability criteria. Seven modeling guidelines are derived from the reviewed literature to facilitate future model-based SSCM research.

AB In many fault detection problems, we want to identify all defective items from a sample set of items using the minimum number of tests. Group testing is for the scenario where each test is performed on a subset of items, and tells whether the subset contains at least one defective item or not. In practice, the number of defective items in the sample set is usually unknown. In this paper, we investigate new algorithms for the group testing problem with unknown number of defective items. We consider the scenario where the performance of a group testing algorithm is measured by two criteria: the primary criterion is the number of tests performed, which measures the total cost spent; and the secondary criterion is the number of stages the algorithm works in, which is referred to as the sequentiality of the algorithm in this paper and measures the minimum amount of time required by using the algorithm to identify all the defective items. We present a new algorithm Recursive Binary Splitting (RBS) for the above group testing problem with unknown number of defective items, and prove an upper bound on the number of tests required by RBS. The computational results show that RBS exhibits very good practical performance, measured in terms of both the above two criteria.

AB This study addresses the problem of combined pricing and inventory control in the context of perishable goods-specifically, when demand is uncertain and price-sensitive and the consumers are free to choose between new and old units, based on the relative affordability of prices. First, the problem is formulated as a periodic review problem for a product with finite arbitrary lifetime and a myopic policy, which is often followed in practice, is discussed. Analytically it is shown that the solution obtained by the policy is also the unique solution that maximizes the individual profits from the inventories at each age. Next, this study addresses a special case-that of products with two-period lifetime, which is a scenario of practical importance. It is proven that under the policy of discounts and sticky pricing, which is often practiced in the brick-and-mortar retail stores, the myopic policy is in fact the steady-state optimal policy of the infinite-horizon problem. The study concludes with a numerical example and directions for future research in the area of joint pricing and inventory management of deteriorating, perishable products.

AB The integration of tactical-level with strategic-level decisions in the supply chain represents an opportunity for substantial cost savings and provides a means for companies to gain a competitive advantage. Much of the previous research on supply chain network design has handled facility location decisions and inventory management decisions independently. In this paper, we develop a new joint facility location inventory model that is based on an approximate one-warehouse multi-retailer inventory model for each warehouse, and on the uncapacitated facility location problem. The proposed integer programming model simultaneously makes decisions pertaining to location and inventory policies on two echelons of the supply chain, the warehouse and the retailers. We develop two Lagrangian-relaxation-based algorithms to solve this model, and compare their performance to that of a conventional branch-and-bound algorithm on randomly generated problems.

AB This paper develops a model for an improved efficiency measure through directional distance formulation of data envelopment analysis. It deals with cases where positive and negative values co-exist as production factors. The developed model has properties such as scalar quantity for measuring efficiency and it identifies all sources of inefficiency. The measure is weakly monotonic; units and translation do not vary with respect to inputs and outputs. The proposed model, under some restrictions, reduces to basic Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) models such as Charnes-Cooper-Rhodes (CCR), Banker-Charnes-Cooper (BCC), and a slack based model (SBM). In addition to the above, the proposed model includes the closest targets for a given inefficient unit to achieve efficiency with less effort. The proposed model is validated using a case study done on Information Technology firms operating in India.

We use each type of tie-breaking rule in the case of three-candidate election in order to make the results more robust. Analyzing our probabilities, we can point out that the probability of individual and coalitional manipulation tend to vanish significantly when the notion of self-selectivity is imposed.

In the first part of the study, we develop and compare specialized methods for scenario generation and scenario tree construction. In the second part, we construct a two-stage stochastic programming problem with conditional measures of risk, which is used to re-balance the portfolio on a rolling horizon basis, with transaction costs included in the model. In the third part, we present an extensive simulation study on real-world data of several versions of the methodology. We show that two-stage models outperform single-stage models in terms of long-term performance. We also show that using high-order risk measures is superior to first-order measures.

Here, the performance of such an aggregation is examined in terms of the calibration and sharpness of the component judgments. The performance is measured through the average quadratic score of the aggregate. Trade-offs between calibration and sharpness are examined and an expression for the optimal weighting of two dependent experts in a linear combination is given. Circumstances where one expert would be disqualified are investigated. Optimal weights for the multiple, dependent experts are found through a concave quadratic program.

AB Scheduling problems are naturally dynamic. Increasing flexibility will help solve bottleneck issues, increase production, and improve performance and competitive advantage of Small Medium Enterprises (SMEs). Maximum make span, as well as the average workflow time and latency time of parts are considered the objectives of scheduling, which are compatible with the philosophy of on-time production and supply chain management goals. In this study, these objectives were selected to optimize the resource utilization, minimize inventory turnover, and improve commitment to customers; simultaneously controlling these objectives improved system performance. In the job-shop scheduling problem considered in this paper, the three objectives were to find the best total weight of the objectives, maximize the number of reserved jobs and improve job-shop performance. To realize these targets, a multi-parametric objective function was introduced with dynamic and flexible parameters. The other key accomplishment is the development of a new method called TIME_GELS that uses the gravitational emulation local search algorithm (GELS) for solving the multi-objective flexible dynamic job-shop scheduling problem. The proposed algorithm used two of the four parameters, namely velocity and gravity. The searching agents in this algorithm are a set of masses that interact with each other based on Newton's laws of gravity and motion. The results of the proposed method are presented for slight, mediocre and complete flexibility stages. These provided average improvements of 6.61, 6.5 and 6.54 %. The results supported the efficiency of the proposed method for solving the job-shop scheduling problem particularly in improving SME's productivity.

AB This study addresses the solution of large-scale, non-convex optimization problems with fixed and linear variable costs in the objective function and a set of linear constraints. A successive smoothing algorithm (SSA) is developed to solve a non-convex optimization problem by solving a sequence of approximated convex problems. The performance of the SSA is tested on a series of randomly generated problems. The computation time and the solution quality obtained by the SSA are compared to a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) solver (CPLEX) over a wide variety of randomly generated problems. The results indicate that the SSA performs consistently well and produces high-quality near optimal solutions using substantially shorter time than the MILP solver. The SSA is also applied to solving a real-world problem related to regional biofuel development. The model is developed for a "system of systems" that consists of refineries, transportation, agriculture, water resources and crops and energy market systems, resulting in a large-scale optimization problem. Based on both the hypothetical problems and the real-world application, it is found that the SSA has considerable advantage over the MILP solver in terms of computation time and accuracy, especially when solving large-scale optimization problems.

ID MULTIPLE PRODUCTS; APPROXIMATIONS; QUANTITY; RESOURCE; POLICIES
AB In this paper, we study an inventory system with multiple retailers under periodic review and stochastic demand. The demand is modelled as a discrete random variable. Linear holding and backorder costs as well as fixed order costs are assumed. Orders to replenish inventories can be placed at a manufacturer with a limited capacity according to a cyclic order schedule. A fixed portion of the total available capacity in a period is allocated to each retailer, who follows a modified base-stock policy to determine the order quantities. Thus, the order policy consists of four policy parameters for each retailer: the length of the review period, the first order point within a planning horizon, the individual capacity limit, and the modified base-stock level. We present an algorithm to compute the exact optimal policy parameters and two heuristics. In a numerical study, we compare the results of these approaches and derive insights into the performance of the heuristics. In addition, we introduce three different schedule types and identify the situations, in which they perform best.

AB An optimization model for the execution of algorithmic orders at multiple trading venues is herein proposed and analyzed. The optimal trajectory consists of both market and limit orders, and takes advantage of any price or liquidity improvement in a particular market. The complexity of a multi-market environment poses a bi-level nonlinear optimization problem. The lower-level problem admits a unique solution thus enabling the second order conditions to be satisfied under a set of reasonable assumptions. The model is computationally affordable and solvable using standard software packages. The simulation results presented in the paper show the model's effectiveness using real trade data. From the outset, great effort was made to ensure that this was a challenging practical problem which also had a direct real world application. To be able to estimate in realtime the probability of fill for tens of thousands of orders at multiple price levels in a liquidity fragmented market place and finally carry out an optimization procedure to find the most optimal order placement solution is a significant computational breakthrough.

AB We propose the new Top-Dog-Index, a measure for the branch-dependent historic deviation of the supply data of apparel sizes from the sales data of a fashion discounter. Our approach individually measures for each branch the scarcest and the amplest sizes, aggregated over all products. This measurement can iteratively be used to adapt the size distributions in the pre-pack orders for the future. A real-world blind study shows the potential of this distribution free heuristic optimization approach: The gross yield measured in percent of gross value was almost one percentage point higher in the test-group branches than in the control-group branches.

AB Kusuoka representations provide an important and useful characterization of law invariant coherent risk measures in atomless probability spaces. However, the applicability of these results is limited by the fact that such representations do not always exist in probability spaces with atoms, such as finite probability spaces. We introduce the class of functionally coherent risk measures, which allow us to use Kusuoka representations in any probability space. We show that this class contains every law invariant risk measure that can be coherently extended to a family containing all finite discrete distributions. Thus, it is possible to preserve the desirable properties of law invariant coherent risk measures on atomless spaces without sacrificing generality. We also specialize our results to risk measures on finite probability spaces, and prove a denseness result about the family of risk measures with finite Kusuoka representations.

AB Two decades of research led to the development of a number of efficient algorithms that can be classified as exterior point simplex-type. This type of algorithms can cross over the infeasible region of the primal (dual) problem and find an optimal solution reducing the number of iterations needed. The main idea of exterior point simplex-type algorithms is to compute two paths/flows. Primal (dual) exterior point simplex-type algorithms compute one path/flow which is basic but not always primal (dual) feasible and the other is primal (dual) feasible but not always basic. The aim of this paper is to explain to the general OR audience, for the first time, the developments in exterior point simplex-type algorithms for linear and network optimization problems, over the recent years. We also present other approaches that, in a similar way, do not preserve primal or dual feasibility at each iteration such as the monotonic build-up Simplex algorithms and the criss-cross methods.

ID DECISION-MAKING; CONSISTENCY
AB Analytic Hierarchy Process is one of the most known multicriteria decision aid methods. Nevertheless, as it relies on decision makers (DM) pairwise comparisons, a problem may occur if some comparisons are not well done. This issue, known as inconsistency, appears when an inconsistency threshold is violated. One way to deal with inconsistency is to redo all judgments, as many times as needed, in order to reach acceptable levels. This work proposes a nonlinear programming model that reduces inconsistency to zero or near zero, without needing to redo all judgments. The reduction is achieved by adjusting the original judgments in a minimum way, keeping the DM's decisions within a tolerable range. Only discrete values are generated, so the solution respects the limits of the Saaty scale (1-9). To illustrate the efficiency of the nonlinear model, a comparison between the proposed model and other models taken from recent literature was made. The results show that the proposed model performed better, since the original judgments were changed in a minimum way, also the inconsistency was completely removed. Alternatively, if some inconsistency is allowed more original judgments can be preserved.

ID OPTIMIZATION; RESOURCES; RIVER; BASIN; MODEL
AB This paper proposes a mathematical model for allocating water to stakeholders of a shared watershed. Each stakeholder in the basin has a water demand and a water profit; however, the available water cannot meet the demands of all stakeholders. This shortage raises a conflict between stakeholders as they use a common resource. To reach an agreement between the stakeholders in water allocation, first a model was developed to obtain the highest possible profit that a stakeholder can achieve if the stakeholder is allowed to utilize as much as possible water after satisfying the basin environmental demands (flows). Then, another model was introduced which allocates water to each stakeholder such that the minimum ratio of stakeholders' profits to their highest possible profits is maximized. It is shown that the obtained solution is non-dominated in terms of considering each stakeholder profit as an objective, which means that none of the objective functions can be improved in value without degrading some of the other objective values. The proposed method is applied to the Sefidrud River basin, which is one of the biggest rivers in Iran. The stakeholders of this basin are eight administrative provinces that compete for utilizing more water while the Basin's water resources could not satisfy all stakeholders' water requirements. The model's results show that it can successfully be used for sustainable conflict resolution in a shared basin because the model satisfies the environmental water requirement in the entire basin and provides equitably the same ratio of the stakeholders' highest possible profits for them.

AB Construction times of new power plants are subject to uncertainty in deregulated electricity markets and they have an important impact on the planning of the expansion of the transmission network. In this paper, we develop a model of transmission expansion planning that is based on Robust optimization and considers the uncertainty in the instant when new power plants are connected into the electricity grid. Using this transmission expansion planning model, we assess the impact of postponing the connection time of some new power plants over the system cost and the optimal network expansion plan. By obtaining the optimal solutions of the proposed model for different levels of robustness, we are able to rank the new power plants with respect to how much the delay of each project negatively affects the system cost. We illustrate our methodology and the performance of two solution approaches proposed to solve our model by using a 34-node stylized version of the main Chilean grid. In the case of the main Chilean grid, the results obtained indicate that some of the projects whose delays negatively affect the most to the system cost are the renewable power plants projected for the next ten years. This is important from the regulator viewpoint because it allows the assessment of renewable energy policies that accelerate the installation of renewable new power plants also in terms of their impact over the transmission expansion planning.

AB The problem of open-shop scheduling includes a set of activities which must be performed on a limited set of machines. The goal of scheduling in open-shop is the presentation of a scheduled program for performance of the whole operation, so that the ending performance time of all job operations will be minimised. The open-shop scheduling problem can be solved in polynomial time when all nonzero processing times are equal, becoming equivalent to edge coloring that has the jobs and workstations as its vertices and that has an edge for every job-workstation pair with a nonzero processing time. For three or more workstations, or three or more jobs, with varying processing times, open-shop scheduling is NP-hard. Different algorithms have been presented for open-shop scheduling so far. However, most of these algorithms have not considered the machine maintenance problem. Whilst in production level, each machine needs maintenance, and this directly influences the assurance reliability of the system. In this paper, a new genetic-based algorithm to solve the open-shop scheduling problem, namely OSGA, is developed. OSGA considers machine maintenance. To confirm the performance of OSGA, it is compared with DGA, SAGA and TSGA algorithms. It is observed that OSGA performs quite well in terms of solution quality and efficiency in small and medium enterprises (SMEs). The results support the efficiency of the proposed method for solving the open-shop scheduling problem, particularly considering machine maintenance especially in SMEs'.

AB Multilevel Stackelberg problems are nested optimization problems which reply optimally to hierarchical decisions of subproblems. These kind of problems are common in hierarchical decision making systems and are known to be NP-hard. In this paper, a systematic evolutionary algorithm has been proposed for such types of problems. A unique feature of the algorithm is that it is not affected by the nature of the objective and constraint functions involved in the problem as long as the problem has a solution. The convergence proof of the proposed algorithm is given for special problems containing non-convex and non-differentiable functions. Moreover, a new concept of -approximation for Stackelberg solutions is defined. Using this definition comparison of approximate Stackelberg solutions has been studied in this work. The numerical results on various problems demonstrated that the proposed algorithm is very much promising to multilevel Stackelberg problems with bounded constraints, and it can be used as a benchmark for a comparison of approximate results by other algorithms.

AB According to regret theory, decision makers may care more about the relative values than the absolute values of alternatives. Generally, the relative values of two alternatives can be reflected from different views. Based on Abelian linearly ordered group, the relative measure is firstly proposed to calculate the relative values from different views. Then two methods are developed to calculate the relative values of alternatives, and are proved to obtain the same result under some conditions on the aggregation operator and the relative measure. Furthermore, based on the relative values of each pair of alternatives, several models are established to identify four types of optimal alternatives. The relationship of these four types of optimal alternatives is also discussed. The proposed methods can be considered as a general framework of the existing ones and can be further extended to identify the most inferior alternatives. Several examples are given to illustrate the proposed methods.

AB In this paper, we study the single-item and the multi-item capacitated lot sizing problem in presence of inventory bounds (CLSP-IB). That is, in any period, both the quantity produced and the stock on hand are limited. For the single-item CLSP-IB with a stationary production capacity, time-dependent inventory bounds and concave costs, we show that the problem can be solved in time by adapting a well-known algorithm in the literature. Restricting to non-speculative costs, we propose an time dynamic programming algorithm. For the multi-item CLSP-IB, we consider the lot-sizing problem with item dedicated machines and a common capacitated storage space shared by all the items. We show that this problem is -hard in the strong sense even if all the cost parameters and capacities of the instance are stationary and identical for each item.

AB In the present paper, we derive a closed-form solution of the multi-period portfolio choice problem for a quadratic utility function with and without a riskless asset. All results are derived under weak conditions on the asset returns. No assumption on the correlation structure between different time points is needed and no assumption on the distribution is imposed. All expressions are presented in terms of the conditional mean vectors and the conditional covariance matrices. If the multivariate process of the asset returns is independent, it is shown that in the case without a riskless asset the solution is presented as a sequence of optimal portfolio weights obtained by solving the single-period Markowitz optimization problem. The process dynamics are included only in the shape parameter of the utility function. If a riskless asset is present, then the multi-period optimal portfolio weights are proportional to the single-period solutions multiplied by time-varying constants which are dependent on the process dynamics. Remarkably, in the case of a portfolio selection with the tangency portfolio the multi-period solution coincides with the sequence of the single-period solutions. Finally, we compare the suggested strategies with existing multi-period portfolio allocation methods on real data.

Analyzing a sample of 70 of the top 100 CPA firms from Accounting Today surveys over the 6 years period 2005-2010, we find that our sample CPA firms as a whole exhibit decreasing returns to scale in the post SOX era, suggesting that these CPA firms had exhausted scale economies by expansions through mergers and acquisitions and organic growth. Thus, these firms may consider stopping their expansion plans and downsizing or divestitures in order to improve their production efficiency.

AB The paper proposes a novel probabilistic model with chance constraints for locating and sizing emergency medical service stations. In this model, the chance constraints are approximated as second-order cone constraints to overcome computational difficulties for practical applications. The proposed approximations associated with different estimation accuracy of the stochastic nature are meaningful on a practical uncertainty environment. Then, the model is transformed into a conic quadratic mixed-integer program by employing a conic transformation. The resulting model can be efficiently addressed by a commercial optimization package. A special case is also considered and a class of valid inequalities is introduced to improve computational efficiency. Lastly, computational experiences on real data and randomly generated data are reported to illustrate the validity of the program.

AB Optimization of industrial structure in agriculture is an important way to promote efficiency and increase farmers' income. After analyzing theories on industrial structure in agriculture, we focus on both the overall growth and the resources of agricultural growth in Western China. We collect per capita net income of rural residents, data on the measurement of agriculture industrial structure, energy efficiency indicators in ten provinces in Western China from 1985 to 2008, and establish a panel data model to explore the influence of agricultural structure on farmers' income in western rural areas, as well as the relationship between agricultural structure and energy efficiency. The empirical results show that optimization of agricultural structure has positive effects on farmers' income and energy efficiency in western rural areas.

AB Over the years, foreign direct investment (FDI) has not only promoted rapid economic growth in China, but also affected the country's environmental quality through technology spillover. This paper tests the variables that may affect the ability of green innovation by using the Granger causality test. It extracts the variables passed the test as input variables, selects the number of patents as output variable, and evaluates the efficiency of various provinces in mainland China by examining their yearly technological progress variables. At the same time, technological progress is defined and divided into capital and environmental factors, and then panel data using the variable coefficients model was used to fit influencing factors to obtain impact coefficients of capital and environment. On this basis, this paper makes the determination of membership to replace the general sense of 'threshold' value by using fuzzy theory and proposes the concept of the 'comprehensive threshold' of economic development and environmental protection. The results show that less than a quarter of China's provinces have crossed the comprehensive threshold. Finally, based on the conclusions of quantitative analysis, some suggestions are proposed that the Chinese government ought to enact different strategies for the introduction of FDI according to different development situations of different provinces.

AB The industry activities produce massive bad by-products, in the form of waste water, waste gas or solid waste, which are the source of environmental issues. The growing concerns over environmental problems make China reconsider the current developing pattern, and partially necessitate the reformation of economic structure. If the environmental consequences from economic structure reformation are subject to empirical testing, it is of vital importance to make some actual measurement for environmental performance. To achieve this goal, this paper proposes a slacks-based environmental efficiency index based on data envelopment analysis (DEA). An empirical application to industry sector of China presents the following findings: (1) approximately two-thirds of the nation's provinces are inefficient due to excessive resource utilization, insufficient products or considerable quantities of wastes; (2) Spearman test shows that SO2 and solid waste intensity have more impacts on industrial aggregated efficiency than those of electricity and COD intensity do, which implies that waste gas and solid waste should be paid more attention in pollution abatement; (3) the environmental protection activities have yielded the expected benefits, as the aggregated efficiency of regional industry has been on a rising trend during the past decade; (4) the west region of China has been developing quickly in recently years and performs well both in economy and environmental control.

AB Traditional efficiency studies using data envelopment analysis (DEA) models considered all input and output variables as continuous, which appears to be unwarranted. Some integer-valued DEA models have been proposed for dealing with the integral constraints in many cases, such as environmental performance measurement, Olympics efficiency assessment, hotel performance evaluation and so on. In existing integer-valued DEA models, the focus is on either input-oriented projection of an inefficient DMU onto the production frontier that aims at reducing input amounts as much as possible while keeping at least the present output levels, or output-oriented projection that maximizes output levels under at most the present input consumption. The present paper develops an integer-valued DEA model that deals with input excesses and output shortfalls simultaneously in a way that maximizes both. An empirical example in the literature is re-examined to compare the DEA model developed here with existing real and integer valued approaches.

AB Aimed at reducing the loss in the process of controlling environmental pollution, this paper proposes an optimization design of EWMA charts for monitoring and evaluating the environmental performance. By using Rayleigh distribution to approximate probability distribution of the random process with mean shifts, the parameters of the EWMA charts for non-normal data will be determined such that the overall mean of Taguchi's loss function (ML) is minimized. Based on these optimal parameters, ML-EWMA charts are constructed for monitoring environmental pollution processes. Then further analysis has been performed to compare the optimization of the ML-EWMA charts and the conventional EWMA charts in terms of their expected losses, the results of which show that ML-EWMA charts in this paper are significantly superior to the conventional EWMA charts as far as the overall loss of ML is concerned. Finally, a numeric example is illustrated to show the application of optimization design of EWMA charts for non-normal environmental data. The optimization design method proposed in this paper can reduce the loss greatly in environmental control and the general idea can be applied in other control charts.

AB Emission trading system plays an increasingly important vole in reducing the pollution for environment. Through mathematical models, an analysis is made on the emissions trading system under an emission reduction framework. Four conclusions are drawn: (1) The impact by environmental taxes on the existing firm's choices of optimal discharging amounts is uncertain, the existing firm's discharging amounts will decrease with the increased prices of emissions permits, and paid initial emissions allowances will reduce the existing firm's profits; (2) Under an intertemporal trading system, the existing firm's holding permits conforms to the principle of profit maximization; (3) Under the intertemporal trading system, the prices for emissions permits for the entrant firms are always on the rise and so are their access costs into the industries, thus frustrating local governments' efforts in attracting investments; and (4) Emissions reduction policy is a good regulatory measure for promoting local economic welfare and realizing sustainable development. Some suggestions are also given for triggering and activating the emissions trading system and formulating supportive policies, such as local governments are obliged to set prices for initial emissions permits to dampen the purchasing impulse of the existing firm and to avoid a thin market of emissions permits.

AB The contradiction between economic development, resources and environment is becoming more and more important every day. Based on the proposed energy conservation, this paper will study whether reducing energy consumption hinders economic growth. This article considers the spatial heterogeneity factors and the different energy consumption levels between different areas. Through empirical analysis, we discuss the quantitative relationship between energy consumption and economic growth from different areas. Finally, we propose long- and short-term strategic arrangements for energy consumption in order to facilitate sustainable development.

AB China becomes the largest energy consumer in 2010 but its energy productivity is well below the world average. To meet China's fast growing energy using, energy efficiency should be especially emphasized under China's energy policy. This paper focuses on the regional level of energy efficiency change in China. And we analyze total factor energy efficiency for 30 Chinese provinces over the period 1998-2009 using Malmquist index method and Tobit analysis. The Malmquist estimation results suggest there is a dropping change trend of energy productivity growth. Chinese energy efficiency still faces with huge regional disparity, but the energy technical efficiency reflects convergence in the nationwide and west region. As a result of Tobit regression, we find that industrial structure, energy consumption structure and institutional factor have different influences on energy efficiency.

AB The paper focuses on the impact of emission 'cap-and-trade' mechanism in a so-called emission-dependent supply chain with the emission permit supplier and the emission-dependent firm. In the cap-and-trade system, emission permit becomes one of key factors of production for emission-dependent firms. Two major sources of emission permits are considered-emission cap/quota imposed by the government, and permits purchased via emission trading. If the quota is insufficient to satisfy the target production, extra permits should be purchased via trading. In this case, the traditional non-profit green organizations may be endowed with the role of emission permit suppliers. Thus, the introduction of market mechanism injects new life into environment protection. In the context of newsvendor, the paper investigates the behavior and decision-making of each member in the emission-dependent supply chain. A game-theoretical analytical model is proposed and the unique Nash equilibrium is derived. In their own self-interest, the emission permit supplier and the emission-dependent firm make their optimal decisions on permits pricing and production quantity respectively. Players' bargaining power in the game is affected by several exogenous factors, such as the governmental environment policy, the market risk, etc. Several valuable managerial insights on bargaining power affected by external factors (such as environmental policies, market risks, etc.) are further concluded.

AB Long-term health care facilities have gained an important role in today's health care environments, due to the global trend of aging of human population. This paper considers the problem of network design in health-care systems, named the Long-Term Care Facility Location Problem (LTCFLP), which deals with determining locations for long-term care facilities among given potential sites. The objective is to minimize the maximal number of patients assigned to established facilities. We have developed an efficient hybrid method, based on combining the Evolutionary Approach (EA) with modified Variable Neighborhood Search method (VNS). The EA method is used in order to obtain a better initial solution that will enable the VNS to solve the LTCFLP more efficiently. The proposed hybrid algorithm is additionally enhanced by an exchange local search procedure. The algorithm is benchmarked on a data set from the literature with up to 80 potential candidate sites and on large-scale instances with up to 400 nodes. Presented computational results show that the proposed hybrid method quickly reaches all optimal solutions from the literature and in most cases outperforms existing heuristic methods for solving this problem.

The model is applied to a sample of public hospitals in Greece and provides estimates of capacity utilization and optimal input usage. Our results indicate that the sample hospitals operated with excess capacity and by underutilizing doctors and nursing personnel. We also found some variation in capacity and variable input utilization across urban and non-urban hospitals. The results from the second stage SUR system of equations show that hospital size and location have a positive effect on hospital capacity utilization while the average length of stay a negative one.

AB In this paper we develop an interactive decision analysis approach to treat a large scale bicriterion integer programming problem, addressing a real world assembly line scheduling problem of a manufacturing company. This company receives periodically a set of orders for the production of specific items (jobs) through a number of specialised production (assembly) lines. The paper presents a non compensatory approach based on an interactive implementation of the epsilon-constraint method that enables the decision maker to achieve a satisfactory goal for each objective separately. In fact, the method generates and evaluates a large number of non dominated solutions that constitute a representative sample of the criteria ranges. The experience with a specific numerical example shows the efficiency and usefulness of the proposed model in solving large scale bicriterion industrial integer programming problems, highlighting at the same time the modelling limitations.

AB This paper introduces a new centrality measure, nominated by the authors as mobility centrality (C (m) ), which arose during the study of the interregional road network in Greece. The proposed measure is constructed by the use of the anagogic method considering the formula of the kinetic energy of a particle in Physics and adjusting its mathematical analogue to the case of the interregional road network. The new centrality measure is estimated to be useful for the operational analysis of a network (such as the analysis of network flows), since it characterizes as central these vertices that appear to have the greatest tendency to attract or expel network flows. The ability of the proposed centrality measure to illustrate flow tendencies was examined empirically by correlating and regressing mobility centrality to the commuting status of the Greek interregional network and to four of the most common existing centrality measures (betweenness, closeness, straightness and degree centrality) of the available data. The empirical analysis indicated that the proposed centrality measure (C (m) ) presents sufficient ability to describe the status of the Greek interregional commuting system and it is believed that it is able to describe the inner potential that produces flows in a network.

This paper has been motivated by the statistical analysis that the author conducted in the past in order to support the management of a Greek basketball team and specifically the decision-making process of its coach regarding the team's strategy during its games. The aim of the paper is on the one hand to present some indicative, simple ideas for the statistical analysis of basketball data, and on the other hand to show that any basketball team can improve significantly its decision-making process if it chooses to be statistically supported. Basketball data is numerous; consequently its elaboration can be extensive and fruitful.

AB This paper addresses the optimal design of a multiproduct, multi-echelon supply network under uncertainty of demand. The network consists of multiproduct production sites, warehouses and distribution centers and decisions about the selection of facilities and their capacity are taken. Furthermore, information about the flows of products transferred and the safety stock at each distribution center is derived. The lead time of an order to a customer is computed, using the probabilities of overstocking and understocking. All these decisions are incorporated into a single period mixed integer non-linear programming problem (MINLP) which minimizes cost. Linearization techniques for selected highly non-linear terms of the models are explored in order to reduce the computational effort for the solution of the model. Finally, a sensitivity analysis is performed by changing product demand parameters and assessing their effect on the supply chain structure.

AB This paper deals with a special case of the non-homogeneity problem related to the determination of the global benchmark technology when measuring productivity changes over time. The authors propose a new way of constructing the global framework of the Malmquist index which applies the minimum extrapolation principle on the aggregation of the experienced contemporaneous technologies. The proposed index, called overall Malmquist index, preserves the role of each contemporaneous technology in the determination of the newly-proposed best practice technology, whereby an acceptable level of discrimination between non-homogeneous observations is provided. With respect to both computational and test properties, the proposed index possesses the circularity property, generates a single measure of productivity change and is immune to infeasibility under variable returns to scale. Furthermore, unlike in the global form, previously computed results by the overall Malmquist index are more stable and less sensitive to changes in the shape of the best practice technology when a new time period is incorporated. Similar to traditional indices, it can be decomposed into various components such as efficiency change, scale efficiency change, and best practice change. The suggested index will be illustrated by means of a real-world example from banking. In particular, it will be compared to the contemporaneous and global forms of the Malmquist index introduced into the literature by Fare et al. (J Product Anal 3:85-101, 1992) and Pastor and Lovell (Econ Lett 88:266-271, 2005) , respectively.

AB This paper proposes a double-sided flexibility in adjusting the lease price as an alternative, more accessible tool for managing revenues or controlling costs in volatile markets. The double-sided flexibility addresses the dilemma of allowing only one party of a lease contract to have the price adjustment flexibility while both parties want it. Although the proposed clause grants both contract parties the right to adjust the lease price for one time during the contract life, one party can enjoy superior flexibility over the counterparty by buying a preemptive right to exercise it. The paper models the double-sided flexibility as sequentially compounded real options and optimizes the exercise decision for each option owner. The proposed flexibility clause is embedded in time charter contracts in the maritime transport industry to illustrate the effectiveness of it in helping manage the price risk of lease contracts.

AB Ticket pricing in public transport usually takes a welfare maximization point of view. Such an approach, however, does not consider fairness in the sense that users of a shared infrastructure should pay for the costs that they generate. We propose an ansatz to determine fair ticket prices that combines concepts from cooperative game theory and linear and integer programming. The ticket pricing problem is considered to be a constrained cost allocation game, which is a generalization of cost allocation games that allows to deal with constraints on output prices and on the formation of coalitions. An application to pricing railway tickets for the intercity network of the Netherlands is presented. The results demonstrate that the fairness of prices can be improved substantially in this way.

AB Megacities around the world are highly concerned about the impacts of urban transportation. The rapid urbanization and motorization in megacities have a direct impact on sustainable development. Hence, it is very frequently to find the multiple actors from both private and public sectors involved in the design and operation of urban passenger transportation systems to make decisions that seek at optimizing their own particular objectives. However, urban passenger transport system is a very complex task involving multiple criteria related to economic, environmental and socio-political issues. Multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) techniques actually aid the decision making process by assessing such problems. This paper presents a review of research papers published between 1982 and 2014 (up to May) concerning MCDM for the design and operation of urban passenger transport systems. From the analysis over more than 30 years, the current paper highlights the importance of taking into account the multiplicity of actors and their own decision criteria, as well as the resolution technique. Finally, some suggestions for future research are discussed.

AB The -median model is used to locate facilities to serve a geographically distributed population. Conventionally, it is assumed that the population patronizes the nearest facility and that the distance between the resident and the facility may be measured by the Euclidean distance. Carling et al. (Ann Oper Res 201(1):83-97, 2012) compared two network distances with the Euclidean in a rural region with a sparse, heterogeneous network and a non-symmetric distribution of the population. For a coarse network and small, they found, in contrast to the literature, the Euclidean distance to be problematic. In this paper we extend their work by use of a refined network and study systematically the case when is of varying size (1-100 facilities). We find that the network distance give almost as good a solution as the travel-time network. The Euclidean distance gives solutions some 2-13 % worse than the network distances, and the solutions tend to deteriorate with increasing . Our conclusions extend to intra-urban location problems.

ID GENETIC ALGORITHM
AB The quadratic multiple knapsack problem (QMKP) consists in assigning objects with both individual and pairwise profits to a set of limited knapsacks in order to maximize the total profit. QMKP is a NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem with a number of applications. In this paper, we present an iterated responsive threshold search (IRTS) approach for solving the QMKP. Based on a combined use of three neighborhoods, the algorithm alternates between a threshold-based exploration phase where solution transitions are allowed among those satisfying a responsive threshold and a descent-based improvement phase where only improving solutions are accepted. A dedicated perturbation strategy is utilized to ensure a global diversification of the search procedure. Extensive experiments performed on a set of 60 benchmark instances in the literature show that the proposed approach competes very favorably with the current state-of-the-art methods for the QMKP. In particular, it discovers 41 improved lower bounds and attains all the best known results for the remaining instances. The key components of IRTS are analyzed to shed light on their impact on the performance of the algorithm.

AB In this paper we develop a multi-item multi-warehouse inventory model for deteriorating items for m secondary warehouses (SWs) and one primary warehouse (PW) with displayed stock and price dependent demand under permissible delay in payment. Items are sold from PW which is located at the main market and due to large stock and insufficient space of existing PW, excess items are stored at m SWs of finite capacity. Due to different preserving facilities and storage environment, inventory holding cost is considered to be different in different warehouses. Here the demand of items is a deterministic function of corresponding selling price and the displayed inventory. Shortages are allowed and partially backlogged. The items of SWs are transported to the PW in continuous release pattern and associated transportation cost is proportional to the distance from PW to SWs. Here , cycle time) be the period of permissible delay in settling account for ith item, without the interest charges. But if the retailer settles the account after , he will have to pay with interest per cycle for the inventory not sold after the due date . A single objective inventory problem is solved numerically by developing Genetic algorithm and the maximum average profit and the corresponding optimum decision variables are evaluated. Finally the model is illustrated using a numerical example. A sensitivity analysis of the optimal solution with respect to the parameters of the system is carried out.

AB The concept of Returns to scale is an important topic in data envelopment analysis since it identifies whether the expansion or contraction of the unit under assessment is beneficial. The quantity of the beneficial expansion or contraction is determined by introducing a most productive scale size (MPSS) pattern. This paper aims at introducing a notion of the nearest MPSS pattern which is the closest MPSS pattern among the others. By the aid of this pattern, a unit would be able to reach its optimal size more easily and by small changes in its inputs and outputs. Finding such a pattern is investigated through BCC and multiplicative models.

AB We describe a compact method to transform arc routing problem instances into node routing problem instances. Any node routing problem instance thus created must be solved by a branch-and-price process, such as the one described in this paper. The purpose is to make the number of nodes in the resulting transformed graphs greater by only one unit than the number of required arcs (arcs having demand) in the original graph, that is, nodes. This low increase in the number of nodes represents an improvement compared to the methods previously presented by Pearn, Assad and Golden ( nodes) and by Longo, Poggi de Arago and Uchoa and also by Baldacci and Maniezzo ( nodes). Using an adapted version of an existing branch-cut-and-price algorithm for a capacitated node routing problem on the transformed graph results in an effective approach for a capacitated arc routing problem. Computational experiments using this approach produced useful lower bounds in reasonable computational time for many challenging numerical instances from the literature. Additionally, some such previously open instances were solved to optimality for the first time.

AB This paper proposes a real options model for valuing the option to delay mobile telecommunications network investment decisions and a method for calculating the real options' impact on mobile service costs. Ranges of option value multiples are calculated for the decisions to invest in a number of network elements, each representing a different part of the mobile network, subject to different demand and technological uncertainties. The value of the option to invest in each network element, net of future replacement options, is modeled as a function of the element's total variable profit and the cost of investment in the element. The model and method are then applied to estimate the real options' impact on mobile termination costs using real cost and volume data.

Shortages are allowed and partially backlogged. The customer returns are assumed to increase with both the quantity sold and the product price. The main objective is to determine the optimal selling price, the optimal length of time in which there is no inventory shortage, and the optimal replenishment cycle simultaneously, to minimize the present value of the total profit. An efficient algorithm is presented to find the optimal solution of the developed model. Finally, a numerical example is extracted to solve the presented inventory model using the proposed algorithm.

ID FIXED ORDERING COST; LOST SALES; STRATEGIES; POLICIES; SYSTEMS
AB We study a periodic review joint inventory and pricing problem of a single item with stochastic demand subject to reference effects. The random demand is contingent on the current price and the reference price that acts a benchmark against which customers compare the price of a product. Randomness is introduced with an additive random term. The customers perceive the difference between the price and the reference price as a loss or a gain. Hence, they have different attitudes towards them, such as loss aversion, loss neutrality or loss seeking. We model the problem using safety stock as the decision variable and show that the problem can be decomposed into two subproblems for all demand models under mild conditions. Using the decomposition, we show that a steady state solution exists for the infinite horizon problem and we characterize the steady state solution. Defining the modified revenue as revenue less the production cost, we show that a state-dependent order-up-to policy is optimal for concave demand models with concave modified revenue functions and provide example demand models with absolute difference reference effects and loss-averse customers. We also show that the optimal inventory level increases with the reference price. All of our results hold for finite and infinite horizon problems.

AB Given and , testing if , the convex hull of , is a fundamental problem in computational geometry and linear programming. First, we prove a Euclidean distance duality, distinct from classical separation theorems such as Farkas Lemma: lies in if and only if for each there exists a pivot, satisfying . Equivalently, if and only if there exists a witness, whose Voronoi cell relative to contains . A witness separates from and approximate to within a factor of two. Next, we describe the Triangle Algorithm: given , an iterate, , and , if , it stops. Otherwise, if there exists a pivot , it replace with and with the projection of onto the line . Repeating this process, the algorithm terminates in arithmetic operations, where is the visibility factor, a constant satisfying and , over all iterates . In particular, the geometry of the input data may result in efficient complexities such as , a natural number, or even . Additionally, (i) we prove a strict distance duality and a related minimax theorem, resulting in more effective pivots; (ii) describe -time algorithms that may compute a witness or a good approximate solution; (iii) prove generalized distance duality and describe a corresponding generalized Triangle Algorithm; (iv) prove a sensitivity theorem to analyze the complexity of solving LP feasibility via the Triangle Algorithm. The Triangle Algorithm is practical and competitive with the simplex method, sparse greedy approximation and first-order methods. Finally, we discuss future work on applications and generalizations.

AB This research considers a flexible flowshop sequence-dependent group scheduling problem with minimization of total completion time. A mixed integer linear mathematical model for the research problem is developed. Since the research problem is shown to be strongly NP-hard, a metaheuristic algorithm based on memetic algorithm (MA) is proposed. A lower bounding method based on the Branch and Price algorithm is also proposed to evaluate the quality of the MA. In order to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithms, random test problems, ranging in size from small, medium, to large are generated and solved by the MA and the lower bounding method. The results show that the average percentage gap of the MA is 6.03 % compared to the result of the lower bounding method for randomly generated test problems.

AB Measuring the performance of participating nations in the Olympic Games is an important application of data envelopment analysis (DEA). Prior literature only considers participating nations' performance in the Summer Olympic Games. It may be unfair to some nations who are good at the Winter Olympics, but poor at the Summer Olympics. Therefore, we believe it is better to consider the two Olympics together when measuring performance of participants. This paper treats the two Olympics as a parallel system in which each subsystem corresponds to a Summer Olympics or a Winter Olympics, and extends a parallel DEA approach to evaluate the efficiency of each participant. An efficiency decomposition procedure is proposed to obtain the efficiency rang of each Olympic subsystem. Finally, we apply the proposed approach to the latest real data set of the 2012 Summer Olympics and 2010 Winter Olympics.

AB The food quality has always played an important role in the retail process since it has been considered as a direct factor to influence a consumer's purchase decision. In this paper, we formulate an inventory model for perishable foods, in which the demand depends on the price and quality that decays continuously. The objective is to determine a joint dynamic pricing and preservation technology investment strategy while maximizing the total profit from selling a given initial inventory of foods. We first prove the existence of an optimal solution based on Filippov-Cesari theorem. Then, we obtain all the candidates and provide the conditions that make a certain candidate be an optimal solution according to Pontryagin's maximum principle. Next, we present an effective algorithm to search for the optimal strategy. Finally, two numerical examples are employed to illustrate the solution procedure and the results, followed by sensitivity analysis and managerial insights.

AB In this paper, multi-stage assembly/disassembly (A/D) queueing networks are analyzed. We consider finite buffer capacities between the stations, generally distributed service times, and synchronization constraints at assembly and disassembly stations. We then describe a decomposition approach for the performance evaluation of such an (A/D) system, especially for the throughput and the variance of the inter-departure times. The two-station subsystems are analyzed as G/G/1/N stopped-arrival queueing systems. The virtual arrival and service rates, and the coefficients of variation are determined using a heuristic approach. A system of decomposition equations which is solved iteratively is presented. Any solution to this system of equations indicates estimated values for the subsystems' unknown parameters. The quality of the presented approximation procedure is tested against the results of various simulation experiments.
   We consider A/D queueing networks with blocking. Our paper extends the work of Manitz (Comput Oper Res 35:2520-2536, 2008) by considering disassembly operations. In addition to that, we give the variability measures of the output process at every station. By considering general service times, it generalizes the work of Gershwin and Burman (Ann Oper Res 93:91-115, 2000). Station failures can be incorporated with the completion-time concept proposed by Gaver (J R Stat Soc 24:73-90, 1962). A comparison to various simulation results shows that the queueing-model based approach presented in this paper yields very good approximations of performance measures.

AB This study presents an iterative local search (ILS) framework used within an agent-based nurse rostering system. This agent based system with the ILS (CNR-ILS) is used to improve nurse rosters with respect to nurse preferences. The system is a heuristic that considers a variety of nurse considerations including informal requested days off, preferences for days-of-the-week off, and preferences for specific numbers of consecutive days off. Since our implementation is not subject to the complexity of mathematical programs, it includes more preference considerations. The system is extensively tested in a federal hospital and is compared to both an integer programming solution from the literature and the scheduling methodology currently used at the test facility. When nurses are surveyed, the solutions found by this system are consistently favored over the solutions from the integer program and hospital's current scheduling practice. Furthermore the variation of those ratings is significantly less.

In this paper, we provide a new necessary condition on the location of these sensors to enable the traffic flow throughout the network to be computed. This condition is not sufficient in general, but we show that for a large class of problem instances, the condition is sufficient. Many typical road networks are included in this category, and we show how our condition can be used to inform traffic sensor placement.

AB In this paper, we develop a supply chain network game theory model with product differentiation, possible outsourcing of production and distribution, and quality and price competition. The original firms compete with one another in terms of in-house quality levels and product flows, whereas the contractors, aiming at maximizing their own profits, engage in competition for the outsourced production and distribution in terms of prices that they charge and their quality levels. The solution of the model provides each original firm with its optimal in-house quality level as well as its optimal in-house and outsourced production and shipment quantities that minimize the total cost and the weighted cost of disrepute, associated with lower quality levels and the impact on a firm's reputation. The governing equilibrium conditions of the model are formulated as a variational inequality problem. An algorithm, which provides a discrete-time adjustment process and tracks the evolution of the product flows, quality levels, and prices over time, is proposed and convergence results given. Numerical examples are provided to illustrate how such a supply chain network game theory model can be applied in practice. The model is relevant to products ranging from pharmaceuticals to fast fashion to high technology products.

AB All the basic models in data envelopment analysis (DEA) divide decision making units (DMUs) in two groups: efficient DMUs and inefficient DMUs, and lack of discrimination of efficient units is a serious problem. Also in spite of completely ranking units in analytical hierarchy process (AHP), the process of making pairwise comparison matrix is based on experts' choices and it causes error and inconsistency in resulted matrix. In this paper first a combined method is suggested for ranking the units and it will use benefits of both AHP and DEA methods to present a rational ranking, also will covers the problem of last methods noticeably and then properties and advantages of suggested method compare with another methods will be explained. Finally, for better comparison some numerical examples will be explained.

AB In operations research and networking problems, random-order-of-service (ROS) provides a well-known alternative to the classic first-come-first-served (FCFS) policy. Models with ROS policy are typically harder to analyze than their FCFS counterparts, with some performance measures notoriously hard to obtain. While significant progress has been realized in the analysis of random-order-of-service models with homogeneous customer service demands, the impact of heterogeneous customer demand is largely unknown. The current contribution studies this impact, with a discrete-time random-order-of-service queue serving customers with heterogeneous demands. Customer service times are independent random variables with type-dependent distribution. The numbers of new arrivals in each slot are independent and identically distributed over time, but can be type-correlated within a single slot. This corresponds to bursty input traffic generated by a finite number of sources, with one source for each type. The burstiness consists in correlation among sources (or types): the rate at which a source generates customers depends on the instantaneous rate of all other sources (and vice versa). Using a transform-based approach yields closed-form formulas for the first few moments of the customer waiting time. Facilitator is a multi-stage description of the customer sojourn, which allows establishing a relation between the so-called conditional waiting time and the actual steady-state customer waiting time. A somewhat unexpected result shows that, under certain conditions on the arrival and service processes, the random-order-of-service policy outperforms the first-come-first-served policy in terms of mean waiting time. A number of numerical examples illustrate this finding.

AB One of the most important aspects of multi-echelon inventory management deals with spare part; because, in the real world, it is more economic to repair equipment than change them. Also, it is possible, when more spare parts bought from an external supplier; seller gives quantity discount for all units. So, this paper considers a multi-echelon spare-part inventory system with backorders and quantity discount of external suppliers. Furthermore, a network approach is applied for modeling and solving these problems. Numerical example shows the efficiency of this algorithm.

AB The security of gas supply is a crucially important question for the economy of any country. South-eastern Australia has a sophisticated network of gas pipelines that connect the production sites on the ocean shelf and in the inner part of the continent with the major consumers, which are the state capital cities (Adelaide, Melbourne, Hobart, Sydney and Brisbane) and the regional industrial town of Gladstone. Two optimization models were developed in order to test the security of the gas supply system against possible global impacts that affect the demand for natural gas. The modeling research in the present work was focused on the simulation of delivery when demands reach their peak values. The first model minimizes squares of shortfalls in major supply nodes. As major constraints the models used the production levels, supply capacities and the mass balance in pipe junctions. The second model minimizes the total cost of gas delivery, which is a sum of production and transportation costs, while the constraints stay the same. Both models were run for a series of plausible economic scenarios which generated the future values of demand. The potential "bottle necks" in the system components were identified. It was found that the first constraint which became scarce is the pipe providing gas to the port of Gladstone. The capacity of this pipe should be increased in order to meet growing demand. Gladstone is also the site of the liquefied natural gas export industry on the east coast. An increase in pipeline capacity will facilitate the increase of export from Gladstone, but will reduce supply to other consumption nodes. A sensitivity analysis (SA) was implemented for both formulations of the model. The objective was to examine how the key indicators of system security and pipeline flow were impacted by changes (increase and decrease) in peak demands. For this analysis the predicted annual scenarios for peak demand increase for four states (ACT was treated as part of NSW in the present work) were used. For the analysis of the decrease of demand, proportional changes of the same magnitude in demand were used for all demand nodes. It can be concluded that with the current infrastructure the most vulnerable components of the system are industrial gas users in Gladstone and Mt. Isa, whereas amongst the domestic consumers it is Brisbane. This conclusion can be utilized in further decisions on pipeline infrastructure upgrades.

AB Maximizing shareholders' value has always been an indispensable goal for publicly traded companies. Shareholders value is highly dependent on the operating expenses, profit margin, return on investment and the overall performance in public companies. We propose a hybrid fuzzy multi-criteria decision making method for measuring the performance of publicly held companies in the Pharmaceutical industry. The proposed method helps investors choose a proper portfolio of stocks in the presence of environmental turbulence and uncertainties. The proposed method is composed of three distinct but inter-related phases. In the pre-screening phase, a set of financial and non-financial evaluation criteria are selected based on the balanced scorecard (BSC) approach. In the efficiency measurement phase, the DEMATEL method is used first to determine the inter-relationships among the BSC perspectives. A fuzzy ANP method is used next to determine the relative importance of the criteria based on the resulting DEMATEL interactive network. In the third step, two different fuzzy data envelopment analysis (DEA) methods are used to evaluate the relative efficiency of the decision making units (DMUs). The fuzzy DEA models are modified by using the relative importance of the criteria and the precedence relations among the input and output weights as additional constraints. Finally, the modified fuzzy DEA models are used to calculate the relative efficiency scores of the DMUs. In the ranking phase, an integration method grounded in the Shannon's entropy concept is used to combine different efficiency scores and calculate the final ranking of the DMUs. The method proposed in this study is used to evaluate the performance of publicly held pharmaceutical companies actively trading on the Swiss Stock Exchange (SSE).

AB Data envelopment analysis (DEA) is a data based mathematical approach, which handles large numbers of variables, constraints, and data. Hence, data play an important and critical role in DEA. Given a set of decision making units (DMUs) and identified inputs and outputs (performance measures), DEA evaluates each DMU in comparison with all DMUs. According to some statistical and empirical rules, a balance between the number of DMUs and the number of performance measures should exist. However, in some situations the number of performance measures is relatively large in comparison with the number of DMUs. These cases lead us to choose some inputs and outputs in a way that produces acceptable results. We refer to these selected inputs and outputs as selective measures. This paper presents an approach toward a large number of inputs and outputs. Individual DMU and aggregate models are recommended and expanded separately for developing the idea of selective measures. The practical aspect of the new approach is illustrated by two real data set applications.

AB We formulate and solve probabilistic constrained stochastic programming problems, where we prescribe lower and upper bounds for -out-of- and consecutive--out-of- reliabilities in the form of probabilistic constraints. Problems of this kind arise in many practical situations where stockout in a number of consecutive or a certain fraction of all periods causes irreparable damage. Examples are determination of reservoir capacities used for irrigation or capital reserves of banks. The optimal solution is typically obtained by the solution of a"reliability equation" involving discrete or continuous random variables. The reliability here is approximated by the use of binomial Boolean probability bounds. For -out-of- reliability, the properties of Gamma distribution are used to approximate the reliability equation. For the consecutive -out-of- case, Binomial probability bounds ( sharp lower bounds, Hunter's upper bound and Cherry tree upper bound) are used to create lower and upper bounds for the reliability constraint and therefore to solve the reliability equation. A bi-section algorithm is finally applied to determine the optimal capacity level.

AB In multivariate stratified sampling more than one characteristic are defined on every unit of the population. An optimum allocation which is optimum for one characteristic will generally be far from optimum for others. To resolve this problem, a compromise criterion is needed to work out a usable allocation. In this manuscript, a compromise criterion is discussed and integer compromise allocations are obtained by using goal programming technique. A numerical example is presented to illustrate the computational details, which reveals that the proposed criterion is suitable for working out a usable compromise allocation for multivariate stratified surveys.

AB In the presence of uncertainty of asset returns, choosing an appropriate risk measure and determining the optimal weights of assets in a portfolio remain formidable and challenging problems. In this paper, we propose and study a mean-conditional value at risk-skewness portfolio optimization model based on the asymmetric Laplace distribution, which is suitable for describing the leptokurtosis, fat-tail, and skewness characteristics of financial assets. In addition, skewness is added into the portfolio optimization model to meet the diverse needs of investors. To solve this multi-objective problem, we suggest a simplified model with exactly the same solution. This modified model greatly reduces the complexity of the problem. Therefore, the mean-conditional value at risk-skewness model can be correspondingly solved. In order to illustrate the method, we provide an application concerning the portfolio allocation of 19 constituent stocks of S&P 500 index using our model. We show that this model could make important contributions to research on investment decision making.

Specifically, the faster server is subject to partial or complete failures, and the slower server is perfectly reliable. The objective is to determine an optimal allocation policy that minimizes the long-run average number of customers in the system. The purpose of this note is to show that some key arguments in Efrosinin (2013) related to the optimality of a threshold policy are incomplete.

ID ANT COLONY OPTIMIZATION; LOCAL SEARCH
AB The car sequencing (CS) problem seeks a production sequence of different car models launched down a mixed-model assembly line. The models can be distinguished by selected options, e.g., sun roof yes/no. For every option, CS applies a so-called sequencing rule to avoid that consecutive models requiring this option lead to a work overload of the respective assembly operators. The aim is to find a sequence with minimum number of sequencing rule violations. This paper presents a graph representation of the problem and develops an exact solution approach based on iterative beam search. Furthermore, existing lower bounds are improved and applied. The experimental results reveal, that our solution approach is superior compared to the currently best known exact solution procedure. Our algorithm can even be applied as an efficient heuristic on problems of real-world size with up to 400 cars, where it shows competitive results compared to the current best known solutions.

AB Revenue sharing is an effective mechanism for coordinating decisions in a supply chain. For a three-stage supply chain, we explore how revenue-based incentives can be used by the stage 1 supply chain agent (retailer) to motivate cooperative behavior from its two upstream partners with conflicting interests. To illustrate our analysis, we provide a food supply chain example, with retailer, processor and farmer. Compared to the frequently studied two-stage problem, a three-stage supply chain leads to a more complex decision and incentive problem. To model and solve this more complex problem, we apply multiscale decision theory (MSDT), a novel approach for multi-level system analysis. MSDT enables us to account for uncertainties at all stages of the supply chain, not just at the final stage, and to derive analytic solutions. Results show and quantify the extent to which contracting and information sharing facilitate chain-wide cooperation. Further, it determines optimal decisions and incentives for agents at each stage. This paper is the first to apply MSDT to supply chains and contributes to its theory by advancing MSDT modeling and analysis capabilities. The modeling and solution approach can be applied to decision and inventive problems in other multi-level enterprise systems.

AB In today's hyper-competitive marketplace, new product introduction is commonly viewed as a vehicle for profitably growing businesses, yet market success remains rare and new innovative products fail at stunning rates. Current corporate thinking identifies a number of potential reasons, one of which lies in the poor execution of marketing-mix strategies. In this paper, we analyze how best to structure the marketing strategy of a company to foster and leverage his innovative new product with a focus on three variables-namely warranty duration, advertising spending and selling price-and attempt to provide a theoretical explanation for factors that affect optimal trajectories of these variables over time. We also conduct a detailed numerical study in order to test which market- and product-related factors have the most influence on and best explain the company's new product introduction strategy, and illustrate the associated profit impacts. Our analysis proposes a time-variant threshold on advertising spending that structures the company's marketing strategy over time. Secondly, we point out that warranty duration and price collectively follow the pattern of the diffusion curve of the new product, but reach their maximum levels before the new product matures. We also provide guidance about the effect of such market- and product-related factors as referral power, failure rates and effectiveness of advertising spending on a company's new product introduction strategy.

AB This study develops a tool to assess livability in European cities covering two components of livability: human wellbeing and environmental impact. First, we propose a conceptual model to assess cities' livability, that extends the concept of urban livability to include a component related to environmental sustainability. Second, we address the measurement of cities' livability. For this purpose, a new composite indicator was constructed based on a data envelopment analysis model specified using a directional distance function. In addition to assigning a summary measure of performance for each city, the composite indicator can be used to guide improvements concerning different livability objectives. One of the innovative features of the model proposed is to enable, by the specification of different directional vectors, focusing separately on each component of livability (e.g., human wellbeing and environmental impact) or alternatively considering cities' potential for improvement in all indicators simultaneously. In addition, it is possible to incorporate a new type of weight restrictions, specified as assurance regions type I, that reflect the relative importance of both desirable and undesirable outputs in percentage terms. Finally, this paper approached the assessment of the evolution of cities' performance over time using the Luenberger productivity indicator.

AB Albizuri and Aurrekoetxea (Soc Choice Welf 26:571-596, 2006a) and Albizuri et al. (Games Econ Behav 57:1-17, 2006b) defined values for games in which the players are organized into an a priori coalition configuration. In games with coalition configuration, we suppose that players organize themselves into coalitions that are not necessarily disjoint. A player can belong to more than one a priori coalition. In this paper we redefine coalition configuration values by using the concept of share function, as introduced by van der Laan and van den Brink (Theory Decis 53:61-86, 2002). A share function assigns to every player in a game its share in the worth to be distributed. We also define and characterize a general class of share function for games with coalition configuration which contains among other values those introduced by Albizuri et al.

These structures contain as particular cases the widely studied communication graph games and permission structures, among others. In this context, we provide axiomatic characterizations of the Harsanyi power solutions which distribute the Harsanyi dividends proportional to weights determined by a power measure for union stable systems. Moreover, the well-known Myerson value is exactly the Harsanyi power solution for the equal power measure, and on a special subclass of union stable systems the position value coincides with the Harsanyi power solution obtained for the influence power measure.

AB We study minimum cost spanning tree problems with groups, where agents are located in different villages, cities, etc. The groups are formed by agents living in the same village. In Bergantios and Gmez-RA(0)a (Economic Theory 43:227-262, 2010) we define the rule F as the Owen value of the irreducible game with groups and we prove that F generalizes the folk rule of minimum cost spanning tree problems. Bergantios and Vidal-Puga (Journal of Economic Theory 137:326-352, 2007a) give two characterizations of the folk rule. In the first one they characterize it as the unique rule satisfying cost monotonicity, population monotonicity and equal share of extra costs. In the second characterization of the folk rule they replace cost monotonicity by independence of irrelevant trees and population monotonicity by separability. In this paper we extend such characterizations to our setting. Some of the properties are the same (cost monotonicity and independence of irrelevant trees) and the other need to be adapted. In general, we do it by claiming the property twice: once among the groups and the other among the agents inside the same group.

AB This paper focuses on compensation rules for multi-stage sequencing games. These rules distribute the implicit losses and gains when the players move from one stage of a multi-stage sequencing game to a subsequent stage. They are necessary because allocation rules that yield core elements for the games in each stage are not guaranteed to yield core elements for the multi-stage game. Three approaches to find compensation rules that yield core elements are studied. Two compensation rules that lead to stable division rules for multi-stage sequencing games are found as a result of these approaches. Axiomatic characterizations of these division rules are discussed.

AB This paper investigates the problem of allocating multiple defensive resources to protect multiple sites against possible attacks by an adversary. The effectiveness of the resources in reducing potential damage to the sites is assumed to vary across the resources and across the sites and their availability is constrained. The problem is formulated as a two-person zero-sum game with piecewise linear utility functions and polyhedral action sets. Linearization of the utility functions is applied in order to reduce the computation of the game's Nash equilibria to the solution of a pair of linear programs (LPs). The reduction facilitates revelation of structure of Nash equilibrium allocations, in particular, of monotonicity properties of these allocations with respect to the amounts of available resources. Finally, allocation problems in non-competitive settings are examined (i.e., situations where the attacker chooses its targets independently of actions taken by the defender) and the structure of solutions in such settings is compared to that of Nash equilibria.

AB Given a finite set X and a collection I =(R (1),R (2),aEuro broken vertical bar,R (v) ) of v binary relations defined on X and given a remoteness rho, a relation R is said to be a central relation of I with respect to rho if it minimizes the remoteness rho(I ,R) from I . The remoteness rho is based on the symmetric difference distance delta(R (i) ,R) between R and the binary relations R (i) of I (1a parts per thousand currency signia parts per thousand currency signv), which measures the number of disagreements between R (i) and R. Usually, the considered remoteness between I and a relation R is the remoteness rho (1)(I ,R) given by the sum of the distances delta(R (i) ,R) over i, and thus measures the total number of disagreements between I and R or, divided by v, provides the (arithmetical) mean number of disagreements between I and R. The computation of a central relation with respect to rho (1) is often an NP-hard problem when the central relation is required to fulfill structural properties like transitivity. In this paper, we investigate other types of remoteness rho, for instance the sum of the pth power of the delta(R (i) ,R)'s for any integer p, the maximum of the delta(R (i) ,R)'s, the minimum of the delta(R (i) ,R)'s, and different kinds of means of the delta(R (i) ,R)'s, or their weighted versions. We show that for many definitions of the remoteness, including the previous ones, the computation of a central relation with respect to rho remains an NP-hard problem, even when the number v of relations is given, for any value of v greater than or equal to 1.

   equilibrium; Perfect equilibrium; Level-k reasoning
ID 2ND-PRICE AUCTIONS
AB In almost common value auctions, even a small private payoff advantage is usually supposed to have an explosive effect on the outcomes in a second-price sealed-bid common value auction. According to (Bikhchandani in J. Econ. Theory 46:97-119, 1988) and (Klemperer in Eur. Econ. Rev. 42:757-769, 1998) the large set of equilibria obtained for common value auction games drastically shrinks, so that the advantaged player always wins the auction, at a price that sharply decreases the seller's payoff. Yet this result has not been observed experimentally. In this paper, we show that Bikhchandani's equilibria are not the only equilibria of the game. By introducing discontinuities in the bids, we establish a new family of perfect equilibria with interesting properties, among them: (i) the advantaged bidder does no longer win the auction regardless of her private information, (ii) she may pay a much higher price than in Bikhchandani's equilibria, (iii) there is no ex-post regret, (iv) the intersection with level-k reasoning is not empty. We also show that a private advantage limits the number of possible discontinuities: one can introduce any number of discontinuities in the common value auction, but this is not possible in presence of a private advantage.

AB This paper deals with simultaneous auctions of two commonly ranked objects following the model studied in Menezes and Monteiro (J. Real Estate Finance Econ., 17(3):219-232, 1998). For these problems we introduce a parametric family of auction mechanisms which includes the three classic auctions (discriminatory-price auction, uniform-price auction and Vickrey auction) and we call it the family. We provide the unique Bayesian Nash equilibrium for each auction in and prove a revenue equivalence theorem for the parametric family. Likewise, we study the value at risk of the auctioneer as a reasonable decision criterion to determine which auctions in may be better taking into account the interests of the auctioneer. We show that there are auction mechanisms in which are better than the classic auction mechanisms with respect to this criterion.

AB This article shows that an apparent puzzle in finance and accounting is resolved by changing from classical to constructive (more specifically, intuitionistic) mathematics. Our position is that it is unproblematic if real-world actors behave inconsistently with nonconstructive mathematical results. Thus the solution to our puzzle lies in a deeper challenge to the standard view of how rational agents reason. The alternative we propose gives refutable predictions that find support in the empirical capital markets literature. Our main tool, intuitionistic mathematics, plays a similar role in the mathematical philosophy literature to that of ambiguity in decision theoretic work.

AB We consider the inventory control of repairable spare parts in a network consisting of a central warehouse, a central repair facility, and multiple local warehouses. Demands for spare parts occur at the local warehouses. If a local warehouse is out of stock, then an arriving demand is satisfied by an emergency shipment from the central warehouse or the central repair facility. Such emergency shipments are common practice for networks that support technical systems with high downtime costs. We develop a new evaluation method that provides accurate approximations for the key performance measures like fractions of demands supplied by the local warehouses or emergency shipments. The method can be easily incorporated in existing (greedy) heuristic optimization methods. Our method outperforms the approximate evaluation method of Muckstadt and Thomas (Manag. Sci. 26:483-494, 1980), as we show via a numerical analysis. Finally, we show that the performance of the system is virtually insensitive to the leadtime distribution of repairs at the central repair facility.

AB High levels of availability and reliability are essential in many industries where production is subject to high costs due to downtime. Examples include the mechanical drive in natural gas pipelines and power generation on oil platforms, where gas turbines are commonly used as a power source. To mitigate the effects of service outages and increase overall reliability, it is also possible to use one or more redundant units serving as cold standby backup units. In this paper, we consider preventive maintenance optimization for parallel k-out-of-n multi-unit systems, where production at a reduced level is possible when some of the units are still operational. In such systems, there are both positive and negative effects of grouping activities together. The positive effects come from parallel execution of maintenance activities and shared setup costs, while the negative effects come from the limited number of units which can be maintained at the same time. To show the possible economic effects, we evaluate the approach on models of two production environments under a no-fault assumption. We conclude that savings were substantial in our experiments on preventive maintenance, compared to a traditional preventive maintenance plan. For single-unit systems, costs were on average 39 % lower when using optimization. For multi-unit systems, average savings were 19 %. We also used the optimization models to evaluate the effects of re-planning at breakdown and effects due to modeling of inclusion relations. Breakdown re-planning saved between 0 and 11 % of the maintenance costs, depending on which component failed, while inclusion relation modeling resulted in an 7 % average cost reduction.

AB We consider an extension of the opportunistic replacement problem, which has been studied by Dickman et al. (The Journal of the Operational Research Society of India, 28:165-175, 1991), Andr,asson (Optimization of opportunistic replacement activities in deterministic and stochastic multi-component systems, Licentiate thesis, Department of Mathematical Sciences, Chalmers University of Technology and University of Gothenburg, Goteborg, Sweden, 2004), and Almgren et al. (The opportunistic replacement problem: analysis and case studies, Preprint, Department of Mathematical Sciences, Chalmers University of Technology and University of Gothenburg, Goteborg, Sweden, 2011), that allows the individuals of the same component to have non-identical lives. Formulating and solving this problem constitute a first step towards solving the opportunistic replacement problem with uncertain component lives. We show that the problem is NP-hard even with time independent costs, and present two 0-1 integer programming models for the problem. We show that in model I the integrality requirement on a majority of the variables can be relaxed; this is in contrast to model II and the model from Andr,asson (Optimization of opportunistic replacement activities in deterministic and stochastic multi-component systems, Licentiate thesis, Department of Mathematical Sciences, Chalmers University of Technology and University of Gothenburg, Goteborg, Sweden, 2004). We remove all superfluous variables and constraints in model I and show that the remaining constraints are facet inducing. We also utilize a linear transformation of model I to obtain a stronger version of model II, i.e., model II+, which inherits the polyhedral properties of model I. Numerical experiments show that the solution time of model I is significantly lower than those of both model II and Andr,asson's model. It is also slightly lower than the solution time of model II+.

AB In Almgren et al. (The opportunistic replacement problem: analysis and case studies, preprint, Department of Mathematical Sciences, Chalmers University of Technology and University of Gothenburg, Goteborg, Sweden, 2011) we studied the opportunistic replacement problem, which is a multi-component maintenance scheduling problem with deterministic component lives. The assumption of deterministic lives is a substantial simplification, but valid in applications where critical components are assigned a technical life after which replacement is enforced. Here, we study the stochastic opportunistic replacement problem, which is a more general setting in which component lives are allowed to be stochastic. We consider a stochastic programming approach for the minimization of the expected cost over the remaining planning horizon. Further, we present a means to compute lower bounds on the recourse function. The lower bounds are used in the construction of a decomposition method which extends the integer L-shaped decomposition method to incorporate stronger optimality cuts. In order to obtain a computationally tractable model, a two-stage sample average approximation scheme is utilized. Numerical experiments on problem instances from the wind power and aviation industry as well as on two test instances are performed. The results show that the decomposition method is faster than solving the deterministic equivalent on all four instances considered. Furthermore, the numerical experiments show that decisions based on the stochastic programming approach compared with simpler maintenance policies yield maintenance decisions with a significantly lower expected total maintenance cost on two out of the four instances tested, and an equivalent maintenance cost compared to the best policy on the remaining two instances.

AB We consider the problem of planning preventive maintenance and overhaul for modules that are used in a fleet of assets such as trains or airplanes. Each type of module, or rotable, has its own maintenance program in which a maximum amount of time/usage between overhauls of a module is stipulated. Overhauls are performed in an overhaul workshop with limited capacity. The problem we study is to determine aggregate workforce levels, turn-around stock levels of modules, and overhaul and replacement quantities per period so as to minimize the sum of labor costs, material costs of overhaul, and turn-around stock investments over the entire life-cycle of the maintained asset. We prove that this planning problem is strongly -hard, but we also provide computational evidence that the mixed integer programming formulation can be solved within reasonable time for real-life instances. Furthermore, we show that the linear programming relaxation can be used to aid decision making. We apply the model in a case study and provide computational results for randomly generated instances.

AB The optimal replacement problem for components with stochastic lives has an appealing solution based on the TTT-transform. The issue is revisited for components which are regularly inspected and where statistical uncertainties are taken into account by means of the method of predicted profile likelihood.
   The ideas are applied on crack growth data on a low pressure nozzle in a jet engine. It turns out that the standard method is not directly applicable and that the effect of uncertainties on the replacement times is not easy to predict.

   ITEM
AB For the spare parts stocking problem, generally METRIC type methods are used in the context of capital goods. A decision is assumed on which components to discard and which to repair upon failure, and where to perform repairs. In the military world, this decision is taken explicitly using the level of repair analysis (LORA). Since the LORA does not consider the availability of the capital goods, solving the LORA and spare parts stocking problems sequentially may lead to suboptimal solutions. Therefore, we propose an iterative algorithm. We compare its performance with that of the sequential approach and a recently proposed, so-called integrated algorithm that finds optimal solutions for two-echelon, single-indenture problems. On a set of such problems, the iterative algorithm turns out to be close to optimal. On a set of multi-echelon, multi-indenture problems, the iterative approach achieves a cost reduction of 3 % on average (35 % at maximum) as compared to the sequential approach. Its costs are only 0.6 % more than those of the integrated algorithm on average (5 % at maximum). Considering that the integrated algorithm may take a long time without guaranteeing optimality, we believe that the iterative algorithm is a good approach. This result is further strengthened in a case study, which has convinced Thales Nederland to start using the principles behind our algorithm.

ID RADIAL-DISTRIBUTION SYSTEMS; ALLOCATION
AB Power distribution utilities must transport quality and reliable electric energy to all of the customers in a given network within specified targets. Failure of one of the network components is the main factor that compromises a system's reliability. Maintenance actions, such as repairs and component replacements, are employed to avoid power interruptions or to resume the healthy network operation. This paper reports the relationship between maintenance activities and reliability as an optimization problem with two criteria: cost of maintenance activities and the maximum value for a system average interruption frequency index planning period. Solving these problems for each network provides local efficient solutions and associated trade-off curves. These solutions are optimally combined to solve a global-level multiple criteria optimization problem, revealing the local efficient solutions and associated trade-off curves for a group of networks or for a whole company. The procedure solves the hierarchical multiple criteria maintenance resources allocation problem and provides information to assess the decisions on maintenance activities at all decision levels in the network management. This procedure is applied to one illustrative example and real-life case studies to demonstrate its benefits.

TI Optimal test planning for High Cycle Fatigue limit testing
SO ANNALS OF OPERATIONS RESEARCH

DT Article
DE High Cycle Fatigue limit; Bayesian experimental design; Staircase method
AB In High Cycle Fatigue (HCF) limit testing the fatigue limit of a mechanical component is determined by applying cyclical stress of a certain amplitude and noting whether the component breaks or not. Since testing is time consuming and expensive, the number of test samples should be kept to a minimum. A common protocol for finding the fatigue limit distribution is the staircase method, in which the testing amplitude is decreased or increased with a fixed step depending on whether the component in the previous test did break or not. We have developed and implemented an alternative protocol, based on Bayesian experimental design, in which the amplitude of each test is selected to maximize the expected information gain of the test. Simulations show that with the proposed method the number of required test samples is significantly decreased as compared to with the staircase method.
