Moreover, the addition of cuprous oxide (Cu2O) could further decrease the total smoke production and carbon monoxide production. The analysis of char residues and evolved gases indicated that Cu2O was beneficial to enhance the formation amount, intumescent degree, and compactness of char. The protective layer of intumescent char residue could hinder the decomposition of EP and diffusion of gaseous products, such as hydrocarbons, aromatic compounds and carbon monoxide (CO). In addition, Cu2O also played a role in conversion of CO to CO2 through a redox cycle, involving the reduction of Cu2+-Cu+-Cu-0 by CO and the oxidation of Cu-0-Cu+-Cu2+ by O-2. The possible flame retardant, smoke suppression, and CO oxidation mechanisms were proposed.

These beds are known to demonstrate heterogeneous mixing and uneven distributions of mass and heat. The effects of the confining wall on flow dynamics were found nonlinear, particularly for aspect ratios lower than 3. High velocities were mainly observed in regions near the wall of aspect ratio value of 1.5 and those of values higher than 3, owing to high local porosities in these zones. Mass dispersion characterized both by experimental near-infrared imaging and by particle tracking showed discrepancies with literature models, particularly for aspect ratios lower than 3. Uncertainties were more significant with the radial dispersion due to bed size limits. Beyond this value, the wall affected more the axial dispersion, confirming the nonlinear impact of the wall on global hydrodynamics.

At a reaction temperature of 500 degrees C, the highest productivity to ethene was observed for the Ni-Ce/Al2O3 catalyst calcined at 500 degrees C. Ni-Ce/Al2O3 catalysts calcined at 500-750 degrees C showed the same selectivity to ethene. The Ni-Ce/Al2O3 catalysts calcined at 900 and 1000 degrees C showed a sharp decrease in the selectivity and the activity, which was probably associated with the formation of NiAl2O4 spinel.

Given an external heating temperature of 655 K, the temporal profiles of the thermal field showed maximum values progressively increasing from 683 to 790 K as the catalyst content was increased from 0 to about 5 wt %. Based on cumulative char and water yields increasing from about 51 to 70 wt % and yields of condensable organics decreasing from about 35 to 15 wt %, the enhancement in the global exothermicity of the conversion process can be attributed to the successive predominance of dehydration with cross-linking reactions over depolymerization reactions. The exothermic effects were found to be qualitatively similar to but quantitatively lower than those associated with a sulfuric acid treatment. For higher acid contents and both additives, the noncatalytic effects associated with their loading were also found to contribute significantly to the characteristics of the thermal field. Specifically, for zinc chloride, the successively higher effective thermal conductivities of the bed caused a progressive reduction in the spatial gradients and maximum temperatures.

In this study, we investigate the reaction of NO2 with solid surfaces of TiO2 covered with a thin layer of an alumina-silica mixture over a range of different compositions. The reactions were conducted in the presence of oxygen under dark or ultraviolet light (UV) illumination conditions. The results show that coating TiO2 with alumina-silica greatly affects the formation of gas-phase products NO and N2O both with or without illumination using UV light. A thick shell of alumina silica enhances the formation of NO in the dark, whereas adding a small amount of alumina on the surface of rutile TiO2 significantly enhances the conversion of NO2 to NO under UV illumination. Overall rates of conversion (on the order of mg/m(2) paint/year) suggest that these materials shoud have negligible impact on NOx levels in the environment.

The degradation of sulfamethoxazole (SMX) with the photocatalyst under UV 350 nm was investigated. The effects of initial target compound concentration, catalyst dosage, and solution pH on the decay performance of SMX were studied. On the basis of the kinetics data, the pseudo-first-order rate constant of SMX decay becomes predictable by using a proposed model in terms of [SMX](0) and catalyst dosage. Light attenuation was found and analyzed by a linear correlation between k and transmission via a common factor (i.e., the catalyst dosage). The photocatalyst was found to be stable within the pH range of 5.2-8.8. The photocatalyst was proved to be easily separated and recycled, and the photocatalytic activity of the recycled catalyst remained intact after extensive reuse, suggesting that the CoFe2O4/TiO2 is a stable and highly efficient catalyst with good potential in real applications.

Based on this nanodispersion, we further fabricate a transparent poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA)/MH nanocomposite with enhanced flame-retardant property by a solution-mixing method. The PVA/MH nanocomposite can keep good transparency even at high MR contents. The limiting oxygen index (LOT) of PVA/MH nanocomposite with 50 phr MH is improved by 45% compared to pure PVA. The peak of heat release rate (pHRR) in the microscale combustion calorimetry (MCC) significantly reduces from 453 W/g for pure PVA to 332 W/g. Importantly, a smooth and compact residue layer for the PVA/MH nanocomposite is formed during combustion, which yields a barrier for the transfer of heat and oxygen. These results indicate that the PVA/MH is an excellent transparent flame-retardant material, which opens a door to manufacture transparent and fire-resistant polymer-based nanocomposites with environmental-friendly process.

The results show that silicon nitride substrates exhibit better load-bearing capability compared with zirconium oxide because of their special physical properties and chemical activity. Meanwhile, alkylphosphate ionic liquids exhibit better friction-reducing and antiwear properties than the common ionic liquid 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium hexafluorophosphate (L-P104) and the base oil poly(alpha-olefin) (PAO). Scanning electron microscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy results indicate that tribochemical reactions occur between the alkylphosphate ionic liquids and ceramic substrates without corrosion during the friction process. When this is combined with the test results for contact angles, it can be concluded that the excellent lubricity of alkylphosphate ionic liquids is ascribed to the synergistic effect between the physical adsorption and tribochemical reactions as well as the polar molecular structure and physical properties of the lubricant.

Untreated KFs of KF35 (large dimension) and KF120 (small dimension) imparted the nucleation effect for PBSA crystallization. KF120 exhibited superior nucleation efficiency compared with KF35. The tensile/flexural moduli of PBSA drastically increased after the addition of KF35 or KF120. Successful modifications of KF35 through NaOH(aq) and 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane (APS) were confirmed. The APS-treated KF (KF35AS) exhibited enhanced interaction with the PBSA matrix compared with NaOH-treated (KF35A) and untreated KF35. KF35A and KF35AS also facilitated the nucleation of PBSA crystallization. The KF3SAS-incorporated composites exhibited the highest tensile/flexural moduli among the different KF-added systems at identical loadings. The tensile and flexural moduli increased to 629% and 360% (40 wt % loading), respectively, compared with PBSA. The enhanced interfacial interaction between KF35AS and PBSA lessened the negative influence of KFs on the thermal stability and water absorption of PBSA.

The technology was used to make hybrid alginate silica microspheres by droplet coagulation. The microspheres were formed starting from suspensions of sodium alginate, and coagulation occurred in an aqueous solution of calcium ions. To enhance the mechanical properties of the alginate raw material, it was combined with two different silica sources: tetramethyl orthosilicate (TMOS) and commercial silica powder. The two different batches of alginate silica microspheres were fully compared with regard to their morphology, composition, shrinking behavior, and stability in acidic conditions. It was shown that the incorporation of an inorganic matrix resulted in a material with a better stabilized porous structure and a higher resistance in an acidic environment. Both are important when functional particles are designed to be used for adsorption of metal ions, either as a stirred suspension or as a stationary phase in a chromatographic column. A study of the adsorption performance was conducted in batch mode for neodymium(III), a representative element for the group of critical rare-earth elements. The effect of stripping (desorption) on the adsorption performance and reusability was also investigated. The functional alginate silica microspheres show a sustainable character.

A simplified theoretical framework for the measurement of particle sizes based on photon scattering is presented, based on the elastic-sphere-vibration and surface-tension models.

The results are used to generalize semicontinuous separation to N-component mixtures. The proposed five-component separation system, called quintenary semicontinuous separation, requires just a single distillation column with three middle vessels. In contrast, a conventional continuous distillation process would require four columns to achieve the same separation objectives. This process is an extension of three- and four-component semicontinuous separation. These processes are more economical at intermediate throughputs when compared to traditional continuous separations processes as has been demonstrated in previous literature. The feasibility of the process and profitability compared to a conventional continuous process was demonstrated using a mixture of n-alkanes from C6-C10. Dynamic simulation results show that this system is able to remain within safe operating limits. An economic comparison between the continuous and semicontinuous processes shows that the semicontinuous separation process is economically favorable at intermediate flow rates.

The effect of various parameters such as temperature, quality of fuming sulfuric acid, quality of fuming nitric acid, and reaction time was studied for optimization of the nitration reaction condition. In the optimum conditions, the mass ratio of fuming sulfuric acid to sodium 2-chlorotoluene-4-sulfonate and molar ratio of fuming nitric acid to sodium 2-chlorotoluene-4-sulfonate were 4 and 1.05, respectively. The reaction temperature was 5 degrees C, and the time of reaction was 3 h. By applying the optimum reaction conditions, the yield of nitration reaction was increased to 91%, larger than that of the current industrial process whose yield is only 65.7%. The solubilities of sodium 2-chloro-5-nitrotoluene-4-sulfonate in aqueous sulfuric acid solutions were determined by a dynamic method, and the results showed that the lowest sodium 2-chloro-5-nitrotoluene-4-sulfonate solubility was exhibited in 0.7 mass fraction aqueous sulfuric acid solutions. So the product sodium 2-chloro-5-nitrotoluene-4-sulfonate of nitration reaction was separated by filtration from 0.7 mass fraction aqueous sulfuric acid solutions, and the obtained concentrated aqueous sulfuric acid solution was reused.

The estimator is designed based on a principal component analysis (PCA) based method and the nonlinear wave theory of HIDiC. The PCA-based method is introduced to determine the locations of a limited number of measurements, while the nonlinear wave theory is presented to estimate the stage concentration according to the wave profile parameters estimated from the selected measurements. Then the EGMC controller coupling with the online estimation is established. A benzene-toluene system is taken as an illustration, and a comparative simulation study is carried out among the proposed EGMC, a nonlinear-wave-based classical generic model controller (WGMC), proportional-integral-derivative control (PID), and a model predictive control scheme (MPC). Finally, EGMC shows a superior performance over the other control schemes, which confirms the validity of the proposed control scheme.

Extractive distillation was used for separating n-heptane and isobutanol. A sequential iterative optimization procedure optimized the steady state extractive distillation process to obtain a minimal total annual cost (TAC). The dynamic control of the optimal extractive distillation process showed poor controllability. It was found that the dynamic control performance could be improved if the solvent flow rate was increased properly with a small increase in TAC. Hence, the choice of the optimal extractive distillation process for separating a binary azeotropic mixture should be considered from the perspectives of both TAC and the dynamic control performance.

Therefore, a major concern in designing and optimizing natural gas liquefaction processes is the enhancement of energy efficiency. A liquefaction ratio in the natural gas liquefaction process affects the specific energy consumption, which is the energy consumption per unit mass of liquefied natural gas (LNG). However, most of the previous research has not considered the liquefaction ratio of the natural gas. This study focuses on minimizing specific energy consumption of a LNG plant considering the liquefaction ratio. To analyze the effects of the liquefaction ratio, four different cases are set and the optimizations are performed. The objective function to be minimized includes the total energy consumption and specific energy consumption. The result of minimizing total energy consumption converges on the lower bound of the liquefaction ratio, but the result of minimizing specific energy consumption converges between the lower and upper bound. This shows that the total energy minimization does not always have the same meaning as the specific energy minimization when the liquefaction ratio is not fixed. Through this analysis, the relationships between the energy consumption and the liquefaction ratio are found. As the result of the optimization, the optimal compression ratio, temperature, intermediate pressure, and refrigerant flow rate are found, and the specific power was reduced by 16.40% over that of the LNG pilot plant design while yielding the natural gas liquefaction ratio of 86.9%.

The risk related to the selected operating conditions for the freeze-drying process is calculated using mathematical modeling, focusing on product temperature, that should be kept below a limit value, as a critical quality attribute, with the goal of minimizing potential negative effects on patients. An observer is used to identify, in few experimental tests, the values of model parameters, as well as their uncertainty. A target value of the risk is identified, and its effect on the design space is assessed by means of process simulation, thus allowing for the identification of the most suitable operating conditions.

The process was highly endothermic with an outlet temperature of 1190 K. It was found that the industrial plant suffers from high coke filament formation by the methane cracking reaction with the maximum affinity of 3. Moreover, the output H-2/CO ratio of 3.27 was obtained for the industrial case under study. Relevant adsorption isotherms of the components and molecular dynamic simulations showed that hydrogen is not adsorbed on the zeolite SA, while carbon dioxide and methane compete to adsorb on the zeolite. Results of a dual-bed PSA process showed that pure hydrogen (>99%) is produced during the process, and the results were compared to the available data reported in the literature for each step.

Geometry optimization was performed usign density functional theory (DFT) with B3LYP functional and 6-311+G* basis set for individual species and complexes of [EMIM] [EtSO4] with pyrrole/pyridine. The amount of charge transfer in [EMIM] [EtSO4] + pyrrole was found to be similar to 20% greater than that in [EMIM][EtSO4] + pyridine, indicating that CH-pi interaction was stronger with pyrrole. The more negative interaction energy for the complex [EMIM] [EtSO4] + pyrrole implies that [EMIM] [EtSO4] has a more favorable interaction with pyrrole than with pyridine. sigma-profile analysis using COSMO-RS confirmed the pivotal role of the CH-pi interaction between [EMIM][EtSO4] and pyrrole or pyridine. Ternary LLE experiments were performed at 298.15 K and atmospheric pressure to compare the extraction efficiency of pyrrole and pyridine from model diesel compound (n-hexadecane) using [EMIM][EtSO4]. The experimental data showed that [EMIM] [EtSO4] had a higher extraction efficiency for pyrrole than for pyridine, hence validating the computational results. The experimental data were well-correlated by the NRTL model with an average root-mean-square deviation (RNISD) of 0.28%, and COSMO-RS gave excellent prediction of the LLE data, with an average RMSD of 0.99%.

Three ionic liquids showed similar extraction efficiencies and for further work 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium bromide (BmimEr) was selected. The results showed that concentration and extraction temperature have significant effects on extraction yields of the PAHs. The 3.0 M ionic liquid solution was the best concentration for extraction of the PAHs. The highest yields of PAHs were obtained at an extraction time of 30 min. The optimum temperature for microwave-assisted ionic liquid extraction of all the PAHs from petroleum source rock was 100 degrees C. The results also show that microwave-assisted ionic liquid extraction is more efficient than accelerated solvent extraction and Soxhlet extraction. This study showed that microwave-assisted ionic liquid extraction (MAILE) is an efficient green analytical sample preparation technique for geochemical evaluation of petroleum source rock.

The experimental results indicated that the hydroxyl-functionalized ILs presented better extraction ability than the dialkylimidazolium-based ILs. The extraction efficiency was significantly influenced by the pH of the aqueous phase. Moreover, the cationic form of tryptophan preferred to transfer into the IL phase, thereby suggesting a cation-exchange extraction mechanism. Driving forces of the extraction processes included hydrogen bonding, hydrophobicity, pi-pi stacking, and the screening effect. Among these factors, hydrogen bonding was the main parameter, as suggested by the results of thermodynamic analysis. After extraction, [C(1)C(6)OHim]NTf2 could be reused by using the pH swing effect. These findings demonstrate that [C(1)C(6)OHim]NTf2 is a good alternative to conventional solvents for recovering tryptophan from the aqueous phase.

Many empirical approaches have been developed to predict FPs based on molecular structure, sometimes involving a large number of descriptors and resulting in class-specific equations. We demonstrate in this work that a satisfying and rather general prediction of the saturation pressure at the FP can be achieved using only the molecular surface area. This relation in combination with any experimental or computational method for calculating temperature-dependent vapor pressures thus allows for the prediction of the FP. In a second step, we calculate the FPs of mixtures using COSMO-RS activity coefficients. By using the proposed method, we were able to calculate flash points without the need for data typically generated in experiments such as normal boiling points or enthalpies of combustion, although experimental pure-compound FPs and vapor-pressure data still can be used to increase the prediction quality.

An interesting phenomenon was observed, namely, a synergistic effect of the binary solvent mixtures on solubility. In this synergistic effect, the solubility of genistin reached a maximum and was higher than its solubility in the separate solvents when the initial mole fraction of ethanol or acetone was 0.5 throughout the whole range of temperatures studied. The solubility of genistin in the mixtures increased with temperature. A simplified thermodynamic model, the modified Apelblat model, and the a model were used to correlate the solubility data of genistin with temperature. Among the three models, the modified Apelblat model showed the best correlation in describing the dependence of the solubility on temperature. Furthermore, to illustrate the effects of both the temperature and the initial mass fraction of ethanol or acetone on the changes in the solubility of genistin, nonrandom two-liquid (NRTL), Sun, and Ma models were also used to correlate the data. The results showed that the solubilities calculated by the Sun model showed better agreement with the experimental data than those calculated by the other two models.

Consistency of Vapor Pressure Equations at the Critical Point	INDUSTRIAL & ENGINEERING CHEMISTRY RESEARCH			English	Article							ORDINARY WATER SUBSTANCE; THERMODYNAMIC PROPERTIES; COMPRESSIBILITY FACTOR; CRITICAL-TEMPERATURES; CRITICAL REGION; VAPORIZATION; LIQUID; FLUIDS; CURVE	In this work, it is shown that the most common approximations for the vapor-pressure equation of a fluid yield an inappropriate behavior for the second temperature derivative of the saturation pressure in the vicinity of the critical point. This fact gives rise to an unphysical divergent behavior for the change of the specific heat at vaporization (Delta(v)c(nu)) near the critical point. An expression for the vapor-pressure equation with the appropriate critical behavior is proposed in terms of a truncated Renormalization Group (RG) expansion. As an example, it is shown that the well-known Wagner and Pruss vapor-pressure equation and the IAPWS-95 result for water yield an incorrect critical behavior for Delta(v)c(nu), whereas the RG equation, in agreement with the results of a crossover equation of state, provides the appropriate critical behavior. An application to the Ambrose-Walton vapor pressure equation is also presented.

Melt Blowing Dies with Louvers	INDUSTRIAL & ENGINEERING CHEMISTRY RESEARCH			English	Article							FIELDS	A slot die is the most common type of spinning device used to make melt blown fibers. A pair of louvers was installed in the air flow field of a melt blowing die. Air velocity measurements were taken in the presence of the louvers and in the absence of the louvers. In some experiments, the louvers were parallel with the airflow. In other experiments, the louvers were angled relative to the airflow at angles up to 6 degrees. If higher air velocities can be achieved with louvers, then the melt blowing process can be improved.

The achieved long-range hexagonal ordering of nanowire-nanotube composite mimics that of the precursor anodic alumina oxide template. The resulting cylindrical composite, 25 mu m in length, consists of a polymer nanotube shell of 280 nm outer diameter filled with a metallic magnetic nanowire core of 140 nm diameter. The magnetic characterization of the nanowire-nanotube composite array indicates the presence of an effective magnetization easy axis parallel to the nanowires, ascribed mostly to the shape anisotropy of Ni nanowires. Moreover, individual composite nanowires can be chemically released from the membrane which opens a new line of technological development in which single composite nanowires profit from their polymeric functionalization while being simultaneously oriented/displaced under suitable magnetic field.

Effects of the rhamnolipid/oil ratios, nitrogen and phosphorus additions, aeration pressures, and setup rotation velocities on the MABR performance were investigated. Results showed that under the optimal conditions, effluent concentrations of chemical oxygen demand (COD), oil content, total phosphorus (TP), and total nitrogen (TN) were 39 mg/L, 2.3 mg/L, 0.29 mg/L, and 1.9 mg/L, respectively. Throughout the treatment, the ADB350 M exerted good adherence to the aerated membranes. In comparison with the direct-spread of engineering bacteria, the membrane-immobilization method reduced losses of the inoculums inside the seawater. Supplement of rhamnolipid was conducive to the improvement of the biofflm hydrophobicity by changing the polysaccharide/protein ratios of extracelluar polymeric substances (EPS). In conclusion, the MABR system substantially removed oil content and other pollutants during the study, and it is of great value to explore the scale-up of this innovative technique for the oil-contained seawater bioremediation.

Novolac Phenol-Formaldehyde Oligomerization Kinetics Analysis	INDUSTRIAL & ENGINEERING CHEMISTRY RESEARCH			English	Article							EPOXY-RESINS	A kinetic model is developed and validated for the acid-catalyzed novolac phenol formaldehyde condensation reaction used to produce the precursor to epoxy novolac. Novolac is widely used in adhesives, structural laminates, coatings, and castings because of high thermal stability and chemical resistance. Fitting of a kinetic model to experimental data for the novolac polymerization showed that formaldehyde and methylol "Q" species do react with significantly different rates. However, in disagreement with previous literature modeling efforts, ortho and para sites react with similar rates, as do internal and external sites. This finding led to being able to account explicitly for the reactivity of available sites for each molecule, removing the need for site balances. This updated model reduced calculated error and allowed determination of the activation energy for novolac polymerization of 79.5 +/- 0.4 kJ/mol.

ZrO2 nanostructures with different crystalline phases and structures were achieved simply by varying the concentration of the added sodium borohydride precipitant without the use of any additional surfactants and templates, and the specific surface area of ZrO2 could reach as high as 275 m(2) g(-1). In the synthesis process, the decomposition of NaBH4 could drive the dynamical perturbation for the reaction system through the bubble effect originating from inosculation and blast of hydrogen in situ generated, which played a crucial role in controlling the formation of ZrO2 nanostructures. Moreover, the present method could be explored for fabricating other fundamentally and technologically important metal oxides (e.g., CeO2, TiO2), indicative of good versatility.

Complex formation involves the OA-assisted dissolution of PEI in a nonaqueous solvent (toluene) by ultrasonication. While PEI itself is immiscible in toluene, various molecular weights (MWs) of PEI (M-W = 600, 1800, and 10 000) visibly dissolved when, in the presence of more than 5-mol % PEI (based on the ethyleneimine (El) unit of PEI), a complex formed between the carboxyl group of OA and the amines of PEI in toluene. Si3N4 and one of the typical multicomponent compositions for Si3N4 ceramic fabrication, Si3N4-Y2O3 MgO, were chosen to demonstrate the usage of PEI OA complexes for improving nonaqueous slurry stability. While nontreated Si3N4 particles rapidly formed dense slurry aggregates followed by solidification in toluene, PEI associated with 30 mol % OA effectively adsorbed on Si3N4 fine particles and drastically improved the flow properties with similar to 1.8 mg/m(2) treatment. Surprisingly, the flow properties were maintained even for dried and redispersed slurries.

J	Lee, SG; Choi, GB; Lee, JM				Lee, Seok Goo; Choi, Go Bong; Lee, Jong Min			Optimal Design and Operating Conditions of the CO2 Liquefaction Process, Considering Variations in Cooling Water Temperature	INDUSTRIAL & ENGINEERING CHEMISTRY RESEARCH			English	Article							HIGH-PRESSURE; CAPTURE; EFFICIENCY	Ship transportation of liquid CO2 is now considered as an alternative transport option to pipelines, in the absence of any suitable onshore storage locations. The compressors for a liquefaction process in the transport chain account for a significant portion of the total energy consumption. The temperature of seawater as an intercooling medium has a very significant effect on the energy consumption of the multistage compressors. Although several studies for the optimal design and operation of liquefaction process have been proposed, they do not consider the seasonal and locational variations in the cooling water temperature; therefore, further improvement in the energy efficiency in the CO2 liquefaction process is necessary. In this study, the variations in the operational energy and other operational issues of the CO2 liquefaction process, according to the actual seawater temperature in the range of 5-30 degrees C was investigated. Moreover, the optimal discharge pressure of the final stage compressor before the Joule-Thomson (J-T) expansion and the pressure ratio of multistage compressors are provided, given the seawater temperature, to minimize the total compressor power consumption. Furthermore, the optimal number and position of multistream heat exchangers are investigated. The total compressor power consumption is similar to 90-140 kW(h)/ton CO, in the seawater temperature range of 5-30 degrees C.

A total of 2416 experimental data points, belonging to 46 ILs over a wide temperature range (223.1-663 K) at atmospheric pressure, have been utilized to carry out validation. The average absolute relative deviation (.AARD %) of the whole data set of the MLR and ELM is 2.72% and 0.60%, respectively. Although both algorithms are able to estimate the heat capacity of ILs well, the nonlinear model (ELM) shows more accuracy, due to its capacity of determining a complex nonlinear relationship. Moreover, the derived models can shed some light onto structural features that are related to the heat capacity and be a suitable option to decrease trial-and-error experiments.

However, salt can be easily removed by rain or automobiles and requires frequent application on roads. Besides this economic consideration, anti-icing agents compromise the mechanical properties of asphalt and have a negative impact on living organisms and the environment when used in large amounts. Incorporation of hydrophilic salts into bitumen, a hydrophobic asphalt binder, and controlled release of specific molecules from this hydrophobic medium can provide an effective solution for reducing ice formation on pavements. Bitumen has previously been modified by various polymers, including styrene-butadiene-styrene (SBS) for improved strength and thermomechanical properties. However, an anti-icing function was not considered in those previous designs. In a previous study, we developed a functional polymer composite consisting of potassium formate (HCOOK) salt pockets dissolved in a hydrophilic gel medium and dispersed in a hydrophobic SBS polymer matrix. Here, we developed an innovative method to obtain polymer composite-modified bitumen and investigated further the anti-icing properties of the functional bitumen. We improved incorporation of this polymer composite into bitumen and demonstrated proper distribution of the composite within bitumen through morphological and rheological analysis. We characterized the anti-icing properties of modified bitumen surfaces and demonstrated significant increases in freezing delay of composite-modified bitumen compared to base bitumen in a temperature- and humidity-controlled chamber. In addition, we characterized the release of HCOOK salt from polymer composite-modified bitumen and observed salt release within the range of 1.07-10.8% (w/w) in 67 days, depending on the composite content. The results demonstrate the potential of this polymer composite-modified bitumen for anti-icing functionality and for industrially relevant applications.

To the best of our knowledge, the reaction between sodium chloride and orthophosphoric acid has not yet been reported in the literature. This study demonstrated the feasibility of the synthesis of sodium dihydrogen phosphate by the reaction of sodium chloride with orthophosphoric acid. A detailed parametric study was done, wherein the influence of reaction temperature, air flow rate, water addition flow rate, and reaction time was investigated. As expected, the evacuation of hydrogen chloride (HCl) was crucial for getting high conversion of NaCl to HCl. The highest conversion of NaCl to HCl reached 91% after 24 h of synthesis reaction. Sodium dihydrogen phosphate (NaH2PO4) was the main product. Pyrophosphate (P2O74-) was only formed at trace amounts, and any trace of trimetaphosphate (P3O93-) was observed.

A major challenge, however, is the stability of the generated foam when it contacts the oil. In this study we investigate the feasibility of using inexpensive nanoparticles made of coal fly ash, an abundantly available waste product of coal power plants, as a foam booster. We investigate the viability of reducing the size of fly ash particles to 100-200 nm using high-frequency ultrasonic grinding. We also study the foaminess (foamability), strength, and stability of the foams made with minor concentrations of fly ash nanoparticles and surfactant, both in bulk and porous media. The effect of monovalent and divalent ion concentration on the foaminess of the nanoash suspension combined with very low concentrations of a commercial alpha olefin sulfonate (AOS) surfactant, in the presence and absence of oil, is studied. We observe that bulk foam that contains very small amounts of nanoash particles shows a higher stability in the presence of model oils. Furthermore, experiments in porous media exhibit remarkably stronger foam with mixtures of nanoash and surfactant, such that the amount of produced liquids from the cores significantly increases. For the first time we show that nanoash can be used to stabilize nitrogen foam in the presence of crude oil at high temperature and pressure. In the presence of oil, the nanoash AOS foam shows a higher stability, although crude oil tends to form stable emulsions in water in the presence of nanoash.

The Incipient Wetness Impregnation (IWI) method of cobalt oxide over gamma-alumina (2% Co3O4/gamma-Al2O3) is used for the preparation of the catalyst. The optimal design of experiments is studied to evaluate the effects of several process variables (namely, temperature, LHSV, and concentration of dibenzothiophene) and their optimal values were found to be 473 K, 1 h(-1), and 1000 ppm, respectively. For the conversion of dibenzothiophene to sulfone and sulfoxide, the results indicates that the IWI method is suitable to prepare this type of the catalyst. Based on the experiments, mathematical models that represent a three-phase reactor for describing the behavior of the ODS process are developed. In order to develop a useful model for simulation, control, design, and scaleup of the oxidation process, accurate evaluation of important process parameters, such as reaction rate parameters, is absolutely essential. For this purpose, the parameter estimation technique available in the general Process Modeling System (gPROMS) software is employed in this work. With the estimated process parameters, further simulations of the process is carried out and the concentration profiles of dibenzothiophene within the reactor are generated.

Compared with the Ni catalysts directly supported on W, Ni/Al2O3-Si and MnOx-promoted Ni-MnOx/Al2O3-Si catalysts exhibited much better catalytic performance for CO methanation, particularly the latter, which exhibited the least decrease in CO conversion (1%) and lowest carbon deposit (0.3 wt %) in a 110 h lifetime test. The structural characterizations showed the highest Ni dispersion and highest oxygen vacancy concentration in the Ni-MnOx/Al2O3-Si catalyst. The added Al2O3 improves the dispersion of Ni, and the MnOx promoter can restrain the sintering and aggregation of Ni particles during the process of reduction and reaction at high temperatures and provides more oxygen vacancies, which is conducive to the removal of carbonaceous species on the :catalyst surface for anticoking.

The results show that the correlated values of k(0) matched well with the experimental values with an acceptable AAD of 8.3%, which indicates that the base-catalyzed hydration mechanism can satisfactorily describe the experimental kinetics data of thel-(2-HE)PP reaction with CO2. In order to comprehensively understand the kinetics, the ion speciation plots of 1-(2-HE)PP-H2O-CO2 system were developed using the pH method. In addition, the Bronsted plots between k(2) (obtained from stopped-flow apparatus) and pK(a) (obtained from experimental measurement) for 1-(2-HE)PP were developed, and then used to predict k(2) using the values of pK(a).

Both, methanesulfonic acid (MSA) and Amberlyst 70 ion-exchange resin were evaluated as catalysts in the reaction. The kinetic effects of the temperature-(353-393 K), the feed molar ratio of alcohol to acid (8:1 to 16:1), and Catalyst loadings (0.5-1.5 wt % of MSA, and the equivalent amount of Amberlyst 70) were evaluated. Experiments were carried out using stirred batch reactors under isothermal operation. A Box Box-Behnken design was used to optimize the number of experiments required to obtain a valid kinetic model. Chemical equilibrium conditions were evaluated independently from kinetic experiments, reducing the number of parameters to adjust during data regression. Self-catalytic rate of reaction was also evaluated, and it was included within the overall kinetic model. The obtained models show good agreement with experiments, and they can be used for process analysis and simulation.

In the present study, the catalytic transesterification of glycerol with dimethyl carbonate (DMC) for the production of GLC was studied with calcium-lanthanum mixed-oxide catalysts at different Ca/La molar ratios. These catalysts were synthesized using an exo- and endotemplating method. The physicochemical characteristics of the catalysts were determined using powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), N-2 sorption, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) of CO2 and NH3. The transesterification of glycerol was found to be highly dependent on the basicity of the catalysts. The catalyst with a Ca/La molar ratio of 3 (3CaLa) showed the highest glycerol conversion and GLC yield. Optimization of the reaction parameters and reusability of the catalyst were studied with the 3CaLa catalyst in terms of glycerol conversion, GLC yield, and turnover frequency (TOF). At the optimum operating conditions, namely, a reaction time of 90 min, a DMC/glycerol molar ratio of 5, a catalyst mass of 0.217 g, and a temperature of 90 degrees C, the glycerol conversion and GLC yield were found to be 94% and 74%, respectively, with a reaction rate of similar to 0.14 mol L-1 h(-1) (with respect to glycerol).

Compared to pure PANT and BAWDC, the as-prepared polyaniline coated boron doped wood derived porous carbon composite (PANI-BAWDC) displays significantly enhanced specific capacitance, due to the synergetic effect between PANI and BAWDC. Moreover, the obtainable highest specific capacitance (421 F g(-1) at 10 mV s(-1), 372 F g(-1) at 2 A g(-1)) and energy density (45.2 Wh kg(-1) at 876 W kg(-1)) of this PANI-BAWDC composite are comparable to those of some similar PANT coated carbon composites, suggesting a good potential of PANI-BAWDC composite for future supercapacitor applications.

This route involves the use of gelatin as a particle suppressant and dispersant. Gelatin has been observed to hinder the growth of the mesoporous silica particles and helps to control the size of spherical particles from micrometer scale (0.14-0.66 mu m) to nanosize (34-82 nm) by promoting the mass ratio of gelatin to template agent cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB), from 0 to 1.0. Moreover, no particle agglomeration was detected because of the excellent dispersion effect of gelatin. MSN has a high specific surface area (1409 m(2) g(-1)) and a large pore volume (0.939 cm(3) g(-1)). It is proposed that the evolution of the size and dispersity of the MSN particles strongly depends on the interaction between gelatin, CTAB, and silica source in the synthetic system.

Its mathematic derivation revealed that results from the reactive flash-cascade model were the same as results from the infinity/infinity analysis method only if the predicted column discharge was a pure compound or a common azeotrope under chemical equilibrium, but those two results were different when the predicted column discharge was a reactive azeotrope. The same phenomenon also appeared in comparison between the singular point equation method and the reactive flash-cascade model rebuilt by a single mole-based parameter. In the case of the reactive azeotrope appearing in the column discharge, both the theoretical discovery and the case study suggested that the separating degree of a RD column predicted by the feasibility analysis was finite, and it may be broken through in reality by means of imposing greater separating power, such as more theoretical trays or a bigger reflux ratio. Results from the feasibility analysis should be checked carefully because appropriate operation parameters can change the predicted separating performance of the RD column.

Biodiesel has been widely recognized to have promising potential. Nonetheless, it is critical to ensure the sustainability of biodiesel production to protect humans and conserve the environment, while achieving economic viability. From the sustainability point of view, it would be more effective to promote the sustainability feature in a process during the design stage rather than at the latter operational stage due to reduced engineering effort and cost. In this paper, a systematic framework for sustainability assessment of biodiesel production pathways during preliminary engineering stage is developed. In preliminary engineering stage, the major process modules (unit operations) with their main process streams are conceptualized in a process flow diagram (PFD). With the PFD, the data on mass and energy balance also become available to the users. With the input data from the PFD, the evaluation is based on the multiple objectives of inherent safety, health and environmental properties, as well as economic performance. Since multiple and conflicting objectives are involved, a fuzzy optimization approach is adapted into the framework. The overall framework is comprised of several major steps, i.e. process simulation, development of a mathematical optimization model, and production pathway optimization and ranking. To illustrate the proposed framework, an assessment is performed to identify the most optimal biodiesel production pathway among four pathways selected from a previous assessment study conducted during the research and development stage.

Although adaptive soft sensors have been developed to reduce degradation of soft sensor models, noise in data has harmful effects to predictive ability of soft sensors. Many chemometric methods such as partial least-squares regression and support vector regression can handle noise. However, these methods do not consider characteristics of operating data or time-series data. Data measured closely in time have strong relationships and correlations. We propose to combine soft sensors with smoothing methods such as simple moving average, linearly weighted moving average, exponentially weighted moving average and Savitzky-Golay filtering. Before model construction and prediction, a smoothing method is applied to each X-variable. Case studies using simulated and industrial data sets confirm that the use of the proposed methods enables soft sensors to predict y-values smoothly and accurately.

The effects of typical Ti sources [i.e., tetrabutyl titanate (TBOT), titanium isopropoxide (TTIP), and titanium tetrachloride (TiCl4)] on the ZnO film morphology, charge transfer, and DSSC performance were investigated systematically. The testing results revealed that TBOT-treated ZnO film exhibited the highest power conversion efficiency (PCE) and short circuit current density (J(sc)) of 4.92% and 12.49 mA/cm(2), respectively, which were largely improved compared with those of TTIP- and TiCl4-treated ZnO films under the same conditions. The excellent performance of TBOT-treated ZnO is mainly ascribed to improved light harvesting and increased charge-recombination resistance.

Standing Wave Design of 2-Zone Thermal Simulated Moving Bed Concentrator (TSMBC)	INDUSTRIAL & ENGINEERING CHEMISTRY RESEARCH			English	Article							SMB CHROMATOGRAPHY; GRADIENT OPERATION; LINEAR-SYSTEMS; SEPARATION; FRUCTOSE; GLUCOSE; PHENOL; UNIT; ENANTIOSEPARATION; PURIFICATION	A two-zone thermal SMB concentrator (TSMBC) can concentrate solutes and recover high purity solvents for dilute feeds. Literature design methods only provide a region of acceptable design parameters, thus requiring many trial-and-error simulations to determine the optimum design. In this study, a Standing Wave Design (SWD) method is developed for a two-zone TSMBC for linear and nonlinear isotherms, and verified with Aspen Chromatography simulations. SWD allows for direct solution of the optimal operating parameters for a TSMBC. A TSMBC is more effective for concentrating dilute solutions. As feed concentration increases, the enrichment factor decreases due to limited adsorbent capacity. A higher enrichment factor is obtained at the cost of a lower feed throughput and higher energy consumption. A TSMBC is more energy efficient than a single stage evaporator or temperature swing adsorption. It also has higher feed throughput and higher enrichment factor than Temperature Swing Adsorption (TSA) for dilute feeds.	[Soepriatna, Nicholas; Wang, N. H.

The naphtha from Shanghai Gaoqiao Petrochemical Company (SGPC) was separated into a raffinate oil rich in non-normal hydrocarbons and a desorption oil rich in normal paraffins, using zeolite SA as an adsorbent. In this paper, we investigate the effects of the adsorption/desorption temperature, feed space velocity, desorption gas space velocity, and switch time on the steady separation of normal paraffins. The adsorbability observed from the breakthrough curves of normal paraffins is consistent with the adsorption energies. The optimal conditions for the adsorption/desorption process were an operation temperature of 270 degrees C, a naphtha feed space velocity of 90.1 h(-1), a switch time of 30 min, a desorption gas N-2, space velocity of 127.5 h(-1), and an intermediate Oil cutting time of 2 mm. With the Cutting Intermediate Oil (CIO) process, the normal paraffin content in raffinate oil was 3.42% and the potential aromatic content was 12.14% higher than that of naphtha. The normal paraffin content of desorption oil was 96.61%, and the ethylene yield was 15.08% higher than that of naphtha.

Previously, the ultrasonic separation and fractionation of milk fat from natural whole milk had only been demonstrated in batches of up to 3 L. This study demonstrated the continuous ultrasonic separation of milk fat using a 1.8 L flow reactor at volumetric flow rates scaled up to 33 L/h by using simultaneous 1 MHz/2 MHz sonication near 30 degrees C. Single pass separation was compared with fat separation cycles consisting of passing the obtained partially skimmed or fat enriched milk multiple times through the reactor for further fat skimming or concentration, respectively. This work demonstrated continuous milk fat globule size fractionation into fat enriched and skimmed streams assisted by ultrasound with collected product volumes significantly larger (between 0.2 and 5 L) than previously achievable in batch processing (between 0.02 and 0.2 L).

Theoretical descriptors were extracted by Dragon software and the E-N(T) model was obtained using multiple linear regression approach. After molecular modeling, four significant descriptors were identified which are related to the E-N(T) values of the ionic liquids and demonstrates good fit statistics and accurate predictions. The stability and prediction ability of the E-N(T) model was evaluated using various common statistical methods such as cross-validation, external validation, and Y-randomization test. As another indicator of model's validity, the leverage and standardized residual confirmed the presence of almost all 52 ILs in the applicability domain of the proposed model.

In this study, we consider coupled momentum and solutal mass transport in a multiphase (gas/liquid) bubble column with a chemical reaction, in a configuration often found in columns used for microorganism growth. We model the reaction with a pseudoreaction term in the concentration balance equation, which represents the growth as a function of species and reactor conditions. We present a linear stability analysis on a two-dimensional bubble column with water as the continuous phase and carbon dioxide as the dispersed phase. It is concluded that in the range of variables examined the flow is always unstable.

The synthesized biocomposite was subjected to the removal of hexavalent chromium from aqueous solution in batch mode. The Fourier transform infrared, scanning electron microscopy, and energy dispersive X-ray analysis techniques were adapted for investigating the functional groups, surface morphology, and elements present in the sorbent. The crystalline nature of the composite was carried out using X-ray diffraction studies. Thermogravimetric analysis gives the thermal stability of the composite. The size and shape of the composite was studied using transmission electron microscopy analysis. The sorption process was optimized by various influencing factors, viz., contact time, adsorbent dosage, initial chromium concentration, temperature, pH, and competing ions for maximum sorption. The equilibrium data were fitted to Freundlich, Langmuir, and Dubinin-Radushkevich isotherms. Thermodynamic parameters indicate the nature of chromium(VI) sorption, and a possible sorption mechanism was proposed for the removal of Cr(VI) using n-HApGel biocomposite. The suitability of the biocomposite at field conditions was tested with field water taken in a nearby industrial area.

In this study, novel conductive composite thermoplastic elastomers (CTPEs) were fabricated by using a copolymer-grafted multiwalled carbon nanotube (MWCNT) composite thermoplastic elastomer filled with varied amounts of unmodified MWCNTs as additional nanofillers. Rheological measurements and electrical conductivity tests were performed to investigate the viscoelasticity and electrical percolation behavior of these CTPEs, respectively. The incorporation of unmodified MWCNTs can significantly increase the electrical conductivity of these CTPEs, and the electrical conductivity percolation threshold was determined to be 0.34 wt %. The macroscopic mechanical properties of these CTPEs can be conveniently adjusted by the content of unmodified MWCNTs; for example, the strain-hardening behavior can be significantly enhanced with the incorporation of unmodified MWCNTs. This design concept can be generalized to other conductive composite elastomeric systems.

Most of these applications will benefit from reduced induction time of hydrate nucleation, enhanced hydrate growth rate, and maximum water-to-hydrate conversion. The addition of surfactants to the gas-water system serves this purpose in a very effective manner. This review focuses on different surfactants that were utilized for gas hydrate formation studies; insights have been provided on the possible mechanisms of action through which these surfactants affect hydrate formation kinetics. A thorough analysis of the existing literature on surfactants suggests that enhanced rate of hydrate nucleation and growth kinetics may not be directly linked to micelle formation. Conversely, reduced surface tension in the presence of surfactants not only enhances the mass transfer but also changes the morphology of hydrate formation, which in turn enhances gas-water interactions for faster hydrate growth rate.

The exploration and exploitation of manganese nodules are necessary to meet the future demands of Mn in the world. This work describes the valuable extraction of Mn through an innovative approach of using sucrose as a reductant. The metal extraction from the nodule leaching was studied in ambient temperature (27 degrees C) and at an elevated temperature 90 degrees C with and without agitation. In both cases, 99.9% of Mn was extracted while the extraction time appears to be significantly low (2 h) at 90 degrees C but it requires a longer time of 24 h at 27 degrees C. The optimum sucrose concentration selected was 7% (w/w) of nodule for maximum metal extraction. With use of 10% (v/v) H2SO4, 7% (w/w) sucrose at 90 degrees C, and solid to liquid (S/L) ratio of 1:10 the achieved metal recovery figures were the following: Mn >99%, Ni 98%, Cu 87%, Co 83% in 2 h. The oxidation pathway of sucrose is outlined in this study with the aid of mass spectrometry during reductive leaching of ocean bed nodule. Sucrose in acidic environment generates 1- or 6-monoacid of sucrose with ions of m/z (mass-to-charge ratio) 355 and 127, 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (5HMF). A dehydrated glucose complex (m/z 325) was generated at elevated temperature. These released organics act as reductant for the leaching of Mn2+ from MnO2. Glucaric acid (m/z 211) is generated as the end product of the sucrose oxidation in the solution.

The production of carboxylic acids through oxidation of lignite is very promising. The traditional alkali oxygen oxidation of lignite can produce high yields of carboxylic acids, but the process consumes a great deal of alkali and acids and the high reaction temperature increases the energy consumption. In the present work, we found that carboxylic adds, including small-molecule fatty acids and benzene poly(carboxylic acid)s, could be obtained by Catalytic oxidation Of lignite in NaVO3/H2SO4 aqueous solution with molecular O-2 The effects of NaVO3/coal mass ratio, H2SO4 content, reaction temperature, initial O-2 pressure and reaction time on the conversion of lignite and Yield of carboxylic acid's were investigated. In the process of reaction, lignite is first converted into water-soluble intermediate; which are then converted into carboxylic acids. The second step is the rate controlling step. It has been found that in the catalytic system, sulfuric acid not only promotes the degradation of lignite, but also changes the activity of vanadium species. Vanadium species promote both the conversion of lignite and the generation of carboxylic acids. The presence of oxygen makes vanadium species complete redox cycle, keeping the reaction ongoing. Compared with the alkali oxygen oxidation, this catalytic oxidation method can reduce the usage of acid and alkali, and lower reaction temperature, while keeping the same yield. The Catalytic system was reused four times without decline in activity.

Remarkably, it was found that O-2(center dot-) can convert the sulfur compounds (i.e., thiophene and 2-methylthiophene) dissolved in these ILs. The products of the conversion were identified as H2O, CO2, and SO3. The conversion percentage ranged from 35 to 99% for thiophene and 20 to 96% for 2-methylthiophene. In addition, a mechanism was proposed for this conversion. Furthermore, the effect of temperature on this reaction was studied and the solubility of sulfur compounds in these ILs was determined. The ILs did not only behave as media for the generation of O-2(center dot-), but they also possessed catalytic activity to accelerate the reaction rate between O-2(center dot-) and substrates.

Necessity and Feasibility of 3D Simulations of Steam Cracking Reactors	INDUSTRIAL & ENGINEERING CHEMISTRY RESEARCH			English	Article							REACTION NETWORK GENERATION; DETAILED MECHANISM GENERATION; COMPUTATIONAL FLUID-DYNAMICS; BETA-SCISSION REACTIONS; LARGE-EDDY SIMULATION; GROUP ADDITIVE VALUES; COMPUTER-GENERATION; THERMAL-CRACKING; PREEXPONENTIAL FACTORS; HYDROCARBON RADICALS	Using detailed kinetic models in computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations is extremely challenging because of the large number of species that need to be considered and the stiffness of the associated set of differential equations. The high computational cost associated with using a detail-ea kinetic network in CFD simulations is why one-dimensional simulations are still used, although this leads to substantial differences compared to reference three-dimensional simulations. Therefore, a methodology was developed that,allows one to use, detailed single-event microkinetic Models in CFD simulations by on the fly application of the pseudo-steady-state assumption to the radical reaction intermediates. Depending on the reaction model size, a speed-up factor of More than 50 was obtained compared to the standard ANSYS Fluent routines without losing accuracy. As proof of concept, propane steam cracking in a conventional bare reactor and a helicoidally finned reactor was simulated using a reaction model containing 85 species: 41 radicals and 44 transported species. Next to a drastic speedup of the simulations due to the kinetic network reduction technique, significant differences were observed between the bare and the finned reactor in the three-dimensional simulations. In particular, the ethene selectivity is reduced by 0.20% by application of the helicoidally finned reactor. The one-dimensional simulations were not able to correctly predict the selectivity effect of the different reactor geometry.

The results show that the acid and the ratio of the strong acid density to the weak acid density can be regulated through modification with different metal chlorides. SAPO-34 modified with metal chloride showed a higher activity and better stability than SAPO-34, and the sample modified with FeCl3 presented the best stability among all of the investigated metal chlorides. The differences in catalytic behaviors among the samples modified with different metal chlorides suggest that the conversion of chloromethane to olefins is strongly influenced by the total acid density and the ratio of the strong acid density to the weak acid density. Coke formation and hydrogen transfer were alleviated over the samples modified with FeCl3, because of their lower total acid density and ratio of strong acid density to weak acid density compared to SAPO-34.

As the number of tubes of spinnerets, electrospinning voltage, and rotation speed of the funnel collector have effects on the structure and properties of the nanowrapped yarns, three series of wrapped yarns were prepared using the self-developed electrospinning and wrapping equipment; these wrapped yarns at the nanoscale were characterized systematically by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), thermogravimetry (TG), and infiltration evaluation. The three-dimensional electric field of the electrospinning system used for the nanowrapped yarn was simulated to model the electric fields of different electrospinning spinnerets. Our experimental results showed that the mechanical, thermal, and hygroscopicity properties of the nanowrapped yarns fabricated in this work were clearly improved obviously in comparison with those of single polyester yarns. The nanowrapped yarn has a core-shell structure composed of both nanoscale PSA fibers and micron-scale poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) fibers, so that it can unite and inherit the excellent thermal properties of the PSA and the excellent mechanical properties of polyester yarns. The newly developed nanowrapped yarns have potential applications in the development of high-performance industrial textiles and apparel in the future.

In order to reveal its dispersion mechanism on the dye, the adsorption characteristics of sodium lignosulfonate (NaLS) and sodium naphthalenesulfonic acid formaldehyde (NSF) were investigated using a quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation (QCM-D) and an atomic force microscope (AFM). The results showed that the adsorption of dispersant onto the dye film layer was low and unstable without salt, but the adsorption amount of NaSL or NSF onto dye film was increased significantly with the increase in ionic strength. This indicated that hydrophobic effect was the main interaction between dispersant and dye. The adsorption amounts of both dispersants were decreased with the increase in temperature. NaLS exhibited the better dispersion and improved stability at high temperature than NSF due to higher adsorption amount and the viscoelastic adsorption layer.

Thirty-nine ternary systems, comprising 371 experimental tie-lines, were correlated by the UNIQUAC and NRTL models. The results, expressed by deviations between experimental and calculated mole fractions, are very satisfactory, with global deviation values of 0.0053 (UNIQUAC) and 0.0072 (NRTL), which are 63% and 45% better than literature reported values. Three quaternary systems and one quinary system were taken from literature to compare the capability of CS algorithm with genetic algorithm (GA) and particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm. The global % root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) value obtained with CS algorithm was similar to 0.14-0.85% as compared to similar to 1.0-2.0% with GA and PSO algorithms. This shows a higher efficiency for the CS algorithm in solving global optimization problems involved in the thermodynamic modeling of multicomponent systems.

Tuning the Kinetic Water Stability and Adsorption Interactions of Mg-MOF-74 by Partial Substitution with Co or Ni	INDUSTRIAL & ENGINEERING CHEMISTRY RESEARCH			English	Article							METAL-ORGANIC FRAMEWORKS; CARBON-DIOXIDE CAPTURE; COORDINATION POLYMERS; HYDROGEN ADSORPTION; FUNCTIONAL-GROUPS; SITES; TEMPERATURE; BINDING; NICKEL; LIGAND	Varying amounts of Co and Ni were substituted-into the metal organic framework Mg-MOF-74 via a one-pot solvothermal reaction, and the effects of these substitutions on CO2 adsorption and kinetic water stability properties were examined. Based on elemental analyses, Co and Ni are more favorably incorporated into the MOF-74 framework from solution than Mg. In addition, reaction temperature more strongly impacts the final metal composition in these mixed-metal (MM) MOF-74 structures than does the reaction solvent composition. Single-component CO2 adsorption isotherms were measured for the MM-MOF-74 systems at 5, 25, and 45 degrees C, and isostetic heats of adsorption were calculated. These results suggest that CO2 adsorption properties can be adjusted by partial metal substitution. Water adsorption isotherms were also measured for the MM-MOF-74 samples, with powder X-ray diffraction patterns and Brunauer-Emmett Teller surface areas measured both before and after water exposure. Results show that Mg-MOF-74 can gain partial kinetic water stability by the incorporation of Ni2+ or CO2+ metal ions that are less vulnerable to hydrolysis than Mg2+. Of particular note, Mg Ni-MM-MOF-74 shows a significant increase in water stability when incorporating as little as 16 mol % Ni into the Mg-MOF-74 structure.

Part I: Carbon Dioxide with the Homologous Series of Alkanes up to 36 Carbons	INDUSTRIAL & ENGINEERING CHEMISTRY RESEARCH			English	Article							VAPOR-LIQUID-EQUILIBRIA; EQUATION-OF-STATE; SUBCRITICAL PHASE-BEHAVIOR; BINARY-MIXTURES; NORMAL-BUTANE; INTERFACIAL-TENSIONS; HYDROCARBON SYSTEMS; TERNARY MIXTURES; SIMULTANEOUS PREDICTION; HYDROGEN-SULFIDE	The Group Contribution with Association Equation of State (GCA-EoS) has been successfully applied to represent the global phase behavior of carbon dioxide mixtures with alkanes. Using a single set of parameters, the model is able to predict vapor-liquid and liquid-liquid equilibria of binary mixtures not included in the parametrization procedure. Special emphasis was set on describing the transformation between types of fluid phase behavior to reduce the jeopardy of predicting incorrect liquid split. This family of binary systems has been investigated in previous works; however, this is the first time that GCA-EoS was shown to be able to represent the transformation between types of phase behavior as the length of the alkyl chain increases. The model was tested against an experimental database covering C-3-C-36 alkanes, temperatures from 210 to 660 K, and pressures up to 400 bar. The wide range of conditions and the parametrization strategy are keys to develop a robust thermodynamic tool for predicting multiphase behavior.

The reactive rescheduling model is triggered off across all the units at the time that tank malfunction is detected. As compared to the previous work (Ind. Eng. Chem. Res.. 2014, 53, 12502-12518) more practical features have been addressed on tank failure handling solutions: (i) failure tank leftover inventory will be first evacuated to a backup tank, and later on directed to downstream units, and (ii) failure tank leftover inventory will be immediately directed to its downstream units. Furthermore, comprehensive strategy analyses have been conducted on partial rescheduling strategy (PRS) and FRS to validate their respective pros and cons. It is found out from case studies that although FRS results in more operational costs than PRS due to an increased number of time events, FRS is more flexible and less susceptible to current scheduling results, which ensures more robust solution identification as compared to the rigid solution space defined by PRS which sometimes leads to operational infeasibility.

Investigation of Reactor Performance	INDUSTRIAL & ENGINEERING CHEMISTRY RESEARCH			English	Article							CARBON-DIOXIDE; GAS-ABSORPTION; AQUEOUS-SOLUTIONS; 2-PHASE FLOW; MODEL; MONOETHANOLAMINE; SEPARATION; CAPTURE; HEAT; SEQUESTRATION	The CO2 absorption performance of hollow-fiber membranes and conventional packed-bed column reactors under similar operating conditions was evaluated. Two-scale, nonisothermal, steady-state models were used to simulate the reactors behavior. The membrane reactor model accounts for CO2 diffusion in gas-filled membrane pores, CO2 and amine diffusion accompanied by chemical reaction in liquid-filled membrane pores, and CO2 and amine diffusion accompanied by chemical reaction in the liquid film zone surrounding the inside membrane wall. The packed-bed column reactor model interconnects a two-fluid 2D hydrodynamic platform with 2D mass and energy transport equations in the gas and liquid phases and nonlinear differential equations governing diffusion and reaction in the liquid film. In the absence of membrane wetting, the hollow-fiber membrane reactor outperforms the packed-bed column reactor with similar volume and specific surface area. This is not the case under membrane wetting conditions, when at low specific surface areas the packed-bed column reactor can outperform the membrane reactor. However, as the hollow-fiber membrane reactors can be stacked with very high specific surface areas in the same reactor volume, the performance of this type of reactor remains better even under partial wetted membrane conditions.

The corrosion inhibition efficiencies of these inhibitors in 3.5 wt % NaCl solution for copper were measured by various measurements including. the polarization curves, the electrochemical impendence spectroscopy as well as the weight loss method. The inhibition mechanism of these new target molecules were analyzed by the plots of Tafel, Nyquist, and Bode. The corrosion inhibition effect was also evaluated by scanning the copper surface with an electron microscope. The results Show that the corrosion of copper in chloride aqueous solution is efficiently inhibited by these new organic inhibitors: Furthermore, the corrosion inhibition efficiencies of the target inhibitors are shown to have much dependence on the carbon chain length attached to the molecular backbone: The inhibitor carrying a 7-carbon chain displays the greatest inhibition efficiency as large as similar to 98% at 0.15 mM, while even the poorest inhibitor containing a 2-carbon chain shows similar to 60% inhibition efficiency. The adsorption of these new inhibitors on copper was further revealed by analysis of Langmuir isotherms and quantum chemical calculations.

Of interest was the chemical and textural changes on catalytic properties as a result of the modification. At low loadings of 0.2-0.5 mmol/g of the metals, the isomerization of 4,4'-diisopropybiphenyl (4,4'-DIPB) was effectively prevented at temperatures as high as 300 degrees C, resulting in high selectivities for 4,4'-DIPB. Metals reduce the acid amounts by low loadings, and deactivate external acid sites. At the loading of 2 mmol/g, only BaMOR was active with high selectivities for 4,4'-DIPB; however, other metals lost catalytic activity with the increase in the loading. These differences are ascribed to changes of acidity and pore size. The modification of barium with high loading formed moderate acidities, and kept pores open for the access of bulky molecules, resulting in the selective formation of 4,4'-DIPB; however, other metals declined the activities by choking pores for magnesium and calcium or by losing acidity for strontium.

This paper focuses on the development and integration of energy balances into a validated solid transport model published by the authors in an earlier paper. In order to facilitate the drying process, a gas phase model is introduced. The gas phase in both the unflighted and flighted sections was modeled as a plug flow system. Simulations and parameter estimation were undertaken using gPROMS (process modeling software). Parameter estimation and model validation were carried out using the experimental moisture content profile, residence time distribution data, and gas and solid internal temperature profiles. The developed model was utilized to gain better understanding of the interactions between solids transport, operational parameters, and internal solids distribution on heat and mass transfer that occur in flighted rotary dryers. The model provides a means to quantify and solve dryer operational challenges in a real industry example.	[Ajayi, O. O.; Sheehan, M.

Current FO membranes consist of a thick microporous support and a paper layer, which creates internal concentration polarization and presents major resistance for water transport across such membranes. This study investigates novel FO membranes consisting of a thin porous structure fully impregnated with a hydrophilic polymer. The elimination of the open-pore structures in these impregnated membranes (IMs) avoids the internal concentration polarization. More specifically, IMs consisting of hydrophilic cross-linked poly(ethylene glycol) diacrylate (PEGDA) in a porous hydrophobic Solupor support were prepared and thoroughly characterized for water and salt transport properties using a dead-end filtration system, salt kinetic desorption experiments, and an FO system. The IMs showed performance ratios (defined as the water permeance in FO mode to that in the dead-end filtration system) 50% higher than those of state-of-the-art commercial FO membranes, demonstrating the promise of the use of IMs to mitigate internal concentration polarization. This work provides a. new route to the design of FO membranes with potentially high performances.

The material is then chemically modified by grafting alanine and serine amino acids. These materials are Characterized by elemental analysis, FTIR spectrometry, XRD analysis, TEM observations and VSM (vibrating sample magnetometry). In a second step, these materials are tested for uranium(VI) sorption. The effect of pH on sorption performance is first investigated before evaluating uptake kinetics (which are fitted by the pseudo-second-order rate equation)and sorption: isotherms (which are modeled by the Langmuir equation). Metal desorption and sorbent recycling are finally carried out for five successive cycles of sorption/desorption. Thermo-dynamic parameters are determined by investigating. sorption properties at different temperatures. Maximum sorption capacities reach 85 and 116 mg U g(-1) for alanine- and serine-based sorbents; respectively. The magnetic properties of the particles allow their efficient separation from the solution by external magnetic field.

The multiphase system was formulated from 1-dodecene, water, and a nonionic surfactant, which increases the solubility between the two nonmiscible liquid phases. On the basis of these systems, we present in this paper a transfer of lab experiments (semibatch) to a successful operation of a miniplant in continuous mode. Under optimized conditions, the reaction showed turnover frequencies of similar to 200 h(-1) and high selectivity of 98:2 to the desired linear aldehyde. The miniplant was operated continuously for a total of 130 h. The control of the phase separation and catalyst recycling for product isolation for a long time period appeared to be challenging. Nevertheless, the separation was kept stable for over 24 h. The organic components in the product phase amounted to desired values between 95 and 99 wt %. The desired 99.99% of the catalyst remained in the aqueous catalyst phase.

The complex HDO reaction network of methyl heptanoate was simplified and modeled using both empirical power-law models and mechanistic models. Surface reaction mechanism was for the first time applied to develop a mechanistic model for the key reaction pathways in the HDO reaction network. Two types of active sites were assumed for the adsorption of oxygenated components (ester, fatty acid, and alcohol) and H-2, respectively. Both the power-law model and the mechanistic model adequately described the features of HDO kinetics, while the mechanistic model outperformed the power-law model. Kinetic modeling was performed rigorously by taking into account the vapor liquid equilibrium and thermodynamic nonideality in the three-phase batch reactor model.

The model is based on measurable and observable parameters of the catalyst and on the energy balance for the fragmentation phenomenon. The model allows the fragmentation behaviors to be discriminated regarding the influence of particle size, polymerization rate, and active site distribution. The results are supported by experimental studies available in the literature indicating the deterministic nature of the model and its capabilities of prediction. The performance of the model allows the optimization of the catalyst synthesis in terms of the nature of the support as well as particle and pore morphology.

Therefore, the melamine content in milk can be qualitatively recognized by the naked eye and quantitatively measured by measuring absorbance. NT-AuNPs show excellent selectivity to melamine against any other tested molecules, anions, and metal ions, as well as very good sensitivity that can distinguish melamine-contaminated milk from safe milk with a limit of detection of 3.5 nM.

The results showed that the surface morphology, crystallization degree, and chemical elements of bamboo fiber were changed after being treated with different surface treatment methods. Then, the treated bamboo fibers were designed to separately incorporate into the nanohydroxyapatite/PLGA (n-HA/PLGA) composite, and the crystallization behavior and mechanical properties of the bamboo fiber/n-HA/PLGA ternary composites were evaluated by DSC, POM, XRD, SEM, and the electromechanical universal tester. The results indicated that surface-treated bamboo fiber has a greater potential in promoting the crystallization of PLGA, and the interfacial adhesion and compatibility were improved, so that the tensile strength and elongation of the composite with alkali treated bamboo fiber were increased by 47.6% and 64.3%, respectively, and the bending strength and flexural modulus of the composite with silane modification after alkali treatment BF were also enhanced nearly 10 and 400 MPa, respectively, compared to the untreated bamboo fiber. All the above results suggested surface-treated bamboo fiber might develop a novel biodegradable bamboo fiber/n-HA/PLGA ternary composite used as bone materials in the future.

This paper presents a soft sensor design using the Fuzzy C-Means clustering combined with the Recursive Finite Newton algorithm to train a nonlinear support vector regression (FCM-RFN-SVR) machine. In the proposed approach, samples are split into some partitions; then, by means of RFN-SVR, a local model for each partition is set. The soft sensor presented in this paper is designed to be implemented on a distillation column so that it can predict the bottom product benzene concentration. Compared to typical support vector regression (SVR), the results demonstrate that the proposed method is more powerful in improving the generalization ability of the soft sensor (smaller mean squared error (MSE) and larger coefficient of determination (R-2) for the testing data).

Within the scope of SOC, this paper develops a CV selection methodology for a global solution which aims to minimize the average economic loss across the entire operation space. A major characteristic making the new scheme different from existing ones is that each uncertain scenario is independently considered in the new solution without relying on a linearized model, which was necessary in existing local SOC methods. Although global CV selection has been formulated as a nonlinear programming (NLP) problem, a tractable numerical algorithm for a rigorous solution is not available. In this work, a number of measures are introduced to ease the challenge. First, we suggest representing the economic loss as a quadratic function against the controlled variables through Taylor expansion, such that the average loss becomes an explicit function of the CV combination matrix, and a direct optimizing algorithm is proposed to approximately minimize the global average loss. Furthermore, an analytic solution is derived for a suboptimal but much more simplified problem by treating the Hessian of the cost function over the entire operating space as a constant. This approach is found to be very similar to one of the existing local methods, except that a matrix involved in the new solution is constructed from global operating data instead of using a local linear model. The proposed methodologies are applied to two simulated examples, where the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms is demonstrated.

Modifier-Adaptation Methodology for Real-Time Optimization Reformulated as a Nested Optimization Problem	INDUSTRIAL & ENGINEERING CHEMISTRY RESEARCH			English	Article								The following work presents a reformulation of the modifier-adaptation methodology for real-time optimization as a nested optimization problem. Using the idea of iteration over the modifiers, this method makes it possible to find a point that satisfies the necessary conditions of optimality (NCO) of the process, despite modeling mismatch, using an outer optimization layer that updates the gradient modifiers with the objective of minimizing the Lagrangian function estimation of the process. Moreover, if a direct search algorithm is implemented in this layer, we can find the optimum without explicitly computing the gradients of the process. The presented scheme was tested in three optimization examples, assuming the absence and presence of process noise, with parametric and structural uncertainty. The results show that in all the cases studied, the method converges to a close neighborhood of a point that satisfies the NCO of the real plant, being robust under noisy scenarios and without the need to estimate process derivatives.

The effectiveness of the proposed method is illustrated by a multivariable case study, considering linear and nonlinear plants.

The aim of this work was to further improve its computational performance by providing an analytical Hessian and realizing a parallel-computing scheme. First, we derived the formulas for computing the second-order sensitivities for the combined approach. Second, a correlation analysis of control variables was introduced to determine the necessity of employing the analytical Hessian to solve an optimization problem. Third, parallel computing was implemented thanks to the nature of the combined approach, because the solutions of model equations and evaluations of both first-order and second-order sensitivities for individual time intervals are decoupled. Because these computations are expensive, a high speedup factor was gained through the parallelization. The performance of the proposed analytical Hessian, correlation analysis, and parallel computing is demonstrated in this article by benchmark problems including optimal control of a distillation column containing more than 1000 dynamic variables.

Such a complex process with a heat-coupling design, a high purity requirement, and a large-scale feature is difficult to analyze and optimize. In this study, a complete equation-oriented (EO) model, which includes a unit model and a thermodynamic model, is developed for cryogenic air separation involving a low-pressure column, a high-pressure column, and an argon side arm column. The EO approach is then applied to deal with the following three issues in air separation: thermodynamic parameter estimation, process analysis with heat-coupling design, and process optimization with varying load demands. The proposed EO method is superior to traditional sequential modular based commercial software in terms of convergence performance.

Effect of Solvent Topography and Steric Hindrance on Crystal Morphology	INDUSTRIAL & ENGINEERING CHEMISTRY RESEARCH			English	Article							POLYMER HETERONUCLEI; POLYMORPH SELECTION; ORGANIC-SOLVENTS; ACID; CRYSTALLIZATION; IBUPROFEN; HABIT	Effect of steric hindrance resulting from solvent topography on the resultant crystal morphology was examined via cooling crystallization of various carboxylic acids in isomeric butyl and pentyl alcohols. Our experiments show that the magnitude of hindrance is related to the degree of branching at the substituted carbon, with hindrance increasing in the order of 1 degrees < 2 degrees < 3 degrees alcohols. The resulting crystals displayed a trend of low, intermediate, and high aspect ratios, corresponding to 1 degrees, 2 degrees, and 3 degrees alcohols, respectively. In particular, 3 degrees alcohols have a tendency to yield significantly different crystal morphologies, compared to 1 degrees and 2 degrees alcohols. Hence, the position of the hydroxyl functional group plays a major role in enhancing or limiting solute-solvent hydrogen bonding interactions and thereby influencing the resultant crystal morphology. A simple molecular model, with succinic acid as test case, was used to demonstrate the extended hydrogen bonding network and surface chemistry binding at the dominant {100} face. This molecular-level exploration of solvent carboxyl hydrogen bonding interaction at the crystal interface helped explain observed macroscopic morphological trends.

However, the leaching of ILs from the solid support has not been investigated in detail. In the present study, the stability of 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride ([Bmim]Cl) impregnated on silica and activated carbon was evaluated during elemental mercury removal (Hg-0) from a gas stream. Silica- and carbon-supported [Bmim] Cl-based adsorbents were characterized before and after Hg-0 adsorption by using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, Brunauer-Emmett-Teller surface area analysis, field-emission scanning electron microscopy, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, and thermal gravimetric analysis. The carbon-supported adsorbent showed better stability (no leaching of 1Ls) compared to the silica-supported adsorbent because of the availability of substantial micropores. The lower stability of silica-supported ILs is attributed to the presence of mesopores on silica support, which holds [Bmim] Cl ineffectively in a gas flow of a high concentration of Hg-0 (Is ppm). The activated carbon-supported ILs, especially in a powdered form, showed higher adsorption efficiency of Hg-0 from a gas stream. The adsorption capacity of powdered carbon-supported [Bmim]Cl was 21 mg/g in 68 h of continuous adsorption.	[Abbas, Tauqeer; Chelappan, Lethesh Kallidanthiyil; Mutalib, M. I.

During this reaction, some functional groups were created in the PVDF structure. The metal organic frameworks, MIL-53(Al) and NH2-MIL-35(Al), were embedded in modified PVDF (M-PVDF) to fabricate mixed matrix membranes (MMMs). Different characterization techniques such as FT-IR, XRD, SEM, DSC, TGA, and contact angle tests have been implemented to identify the prepared membranes. Pure and mixed (1:1) CO2 and CH4 were used to test gas separation performance of MMMs. CO2 permeance was increased for pure M-PVDF membrane compared with the pristine PVDF by 31.2%. Upon 10 wt % loading of MIL-53(Al) and NH2-MIL-35(Al) in M-PVDF, CO2 permeability increased 104.33% and 80.02% relative to the unfilled M-PVDF. The highest CO2/CH4 ideal selectivity and separation factor of 43.9 and 42.65, respectively, were reported for NH2-MIL-35(Al)/M-PVDF with 10 wt % loading. These improvements could be attributed to the breathing effect of MOFs, created polar moieties in PVDF through the modification, and hydrogen bonding interactions between the MOFs and the polymer.

Two kinds of commercial solvent resistant nanofiltration (SRNF) membranes (Desal-DL and SR100, polymeric) were chosen, and their capabilities in removing three common contaminants from diethanolamine (DEA) solution were examined. These contaminants that caused foaming of DEA solution include sodium chloride, sodium sulfite, and acetic acid. From the two tested solvent resistant nanofiltration (SRNF) membranes, it had been found that Desal-DL membrane provided promising results and performance that can be an alternative to conventional separation, including distillation, for purification of amine solution. Experiments were also conducted to test the foaming tendency and stability of the untreated and treated amine solution. The untreated DEA with sodium sulfite had the highest foaming tendency. However, after NF treatment, there was substantial decrease of the foaming tendency. The results obtained confirmed the potential of using SRNF-membranes to reduce foaming tendency and stability in DEA solution.

Furthermore, the properties of the interaction energy, charge-density profiles, and excess enthalpy were obtained, showing that the stronger interactions between AAIL and water lead to improvement of the separation efficiency. To verify the feasibility, the isobaric vapor liquid equilibrium data for two ternary mixtures of acetonitrile + water + [EMIM][Pro] and + 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium acetate ([EMIM] [OAC]) at fixed IL mole fraction (0.05 and 0.10) were measured at atmospheric pressure. The experimental results show that the two ILs can effectively enhance the relative volatility of acetonitrile and break the azeotrope at the mole fraction 0.05 and the higher the IL content in the mixture, the better the separation effect observed.

It was discovered that the nature of the anion influences the Hildebrand solubility parameters by which distillable trifluoromethanesulfonate- (TfO-) based ionic liquids present higher Hildebrand solubility parameters than his(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide- (NTf2-) based ionic liquids. In this work, we also studied the effect of dissolution temperature on the Hildebrand solubility parameters of ionic liquids. An increase in temperature from 25 to 60 degrees C results in a decrease in the Hildebrand solubility parameters of ionic liquids. Moreover, the cohesive energy density, molar internal energy, and enthalpy of dissolution were evaluated. The molar internal energy and enthalpy of dissolution are almost constant or show a slight decrease with increasing dissolution temperature for O-methylated TfO-based ionic liquids.

The method in particular allows a Fickian mutual diffusion coefficient to be calculated directly in a molecular dynamics simulation and provides for a correction of errors due to finite system sizes. It is an equilibrium method that may be performed at the same time as standard thermodynamic computations. The method is tested by simulating a binary system of LJ particles meant to approximate a nonideal liquid mixture of methane and carbon tetrafluoride. Results are validated by comparison to Green-Kubo and nonequilibrium methods and simulation at multiple system sizes.

Wax/graphite composites with core shell structure are used as tracer particles to capture the agglomerates formed in the cold mode experiments. Pressure fluctuation sensors and image analysis methodology are used to characterize the detailed information on agglomerates such as mass, size, and compositions. Experimental results reveal that when the mass fraction of tracer particles is above 10%, agglomerates are formed in the fluidized bed. Compared with coarse particles, small particles lead to agglomeration much easier, and coalescence of small small particles or small coarse particles is the main mechanism by which agglomeration occurs. Analyzing the collision process of small particles and coarse particles, we conclude that collisions among small particles or collisions between small and coarse particles are more frequent and efficient than that of coarse particles.

Since C2H6 is another important component of shale gas, besides CH4, knowledge of CH4-C2H6 binary mixture sorption on shale is of fundamental significance and plays a central role in understanding the physical mechanisms that control fluid storage, transport, and subsequent shale-gas production. In this work, measurements of pure component sorption isotherms for CH4 and C2H6 for pressures up to 114 and 35 bar, respectively, have been performed using a thermogravirnetric method in the temperature range (40-60 degrees C), typical of storage formation conditions. Sorption experiments of binary (CH4-C2H6) gas mixtures containing up to 10% (mole fraction) of C2H6, typical of shale-gas compositions, for pressures up to 125 bar under the aforementioned temperature conditions have also been conducted. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that systematic measurements of CH4 and C2H6, both pure and in binary mixtures, sorption on the Marcellus shale have been conducted, thus providing a comprehensive set of CH4-C2H6 competitive sorption data, which can help to improve the fundamental understanding of shale-gas storage mechanisms and its subsequent production. In the study, the multicomponent potential theory of adsorption (MPTA) approach is utilized to model the sorption data. The MPTA model is shown capable in representing the pure component sorption data, and also provides reasonable predictive capability when applied to predict the total sorption for CH4-C2H6 binary mixtures in shale over a range of compositions and temperatures.

An experimental study for the dynamics of water/ethanol mixtures in both hydrophilic and hydrophobic capillary tubes has been investigated. The combination of water/ethanol mixtures and trimethylchlorosilane coating on capillaries provides a variety of liquid surface tension and contact angle for the penetrating system. Significant differences of penetrating speed on hydrophilic and hydrophobic tubes indicate that dynamic contact angle dominates the hydrophobic surface while liquid surface tension plays a more important role on the hydrophilic surface. The speed gradient of different liquids on hydrophilic surface is greater than the hydrophobic surface, mainly due to the domination between hydrogen bonding structures and water polarity while liquid moves on surfaces covered with different chemistry, physically absorbed water on silica capillaries or silanol group covered capillaries.

However, the strong hydrogen bond networks and the high crystallinity strongly prevent cellulose from reacting with other compounds to produce higher performance materials. In this work, the investigation via molecular dynamics simulation showed that supercritical 1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane (SC R134a) could effectively destroy the strong hydrogen bond networks of cellulose and activate cellulose. Furthermore, experiments were also conducted to support the simulation results, where cellulose was activated via introducing SC R134a and subsequently used in the synthesis of cellulose acetate. The experimental results revealed that SC R134a exhibited a prominent effect on activating cellulose. The crystallinity of cellulose decreased from 0.926 to 0.686 after being activated by SC R134a. In addition the morphology (SEM) of cellulose suggested that the average diameter increased by 25% and numerous cracks appeared on the outer surface of cellulose fibers. Moreover, the consumption of reagents for synthesizing cellulose acetate decreased sharply, especially for acetic acid, which was only 25% of that used in industry, therefore, making the process much more green and energy-saving.

In this study, four-compartment electrodialysis was used to convert KCl with (NH4)(2)SO4 into K2SO4 to overcome the shortcomings of traditional methods. The phase of product crystals was identified by XRD and the crystal composition was determined by the ion content. Economic evaluation was conducted, and the effects of operation variables on conversion performance were investigated. Results showed that as current density increases from 10 to 25 mA/cm(2), operation time decreases from 135 to 55 min while energy consumption increases from 0.26 to 0.50 kw.h/kg K2SO4. A slightly higher than theoretical molar ratio of (NH4)(2)SO4 to KCl can ensure the complete conversion of KCl into K2SO4. In addition, final K2SO4 concentrations could be increased by reducing the initial K2SO4 tank volume. Finally, higher temperature is beneficial for conversion performance and subsequent evaporation crystallization.

The as-obtained OSTs were then used as flame-retardant carbon sources with microencapsulated ammonium polyphosphate (MFAPP) in epoxy resin (EP). Compared to EP, the obtained EP/MFAPP/OST composites exhibit significantly enhanced flame retardancy. The introduction of only 6.25 wt % OSTs and 6.25 wt % MFAPP results in remarkably increased limiting oxygen index and decreased heat release rate, and all composites can reach UL94 V-0 rating. Thermogravimetric analyses and cone calorimetry results suggest both OSTs and MFAPP have good catalytic charring effects, and the increased carboxyl content benefits the char formation of the composites. Because of the formation of compact char on the sample surface during combustion, the transfer of oxygen, heat, and flammable gas products is inhibited; the flame retardancy of EP/MFAPP/OST composites is thus remarkably enhanced.

Changes in gel content and molecular weight with reaction temperature and reaction time were analyzed in a batch reactor, and kinetic parameters were calculated from the experimental data. The reaction time for de-crosslinking shortened as the reaction temperature increased and the complete de-crosslinking of S-XLPE was achieved at 320 degrees C and 20 min. The de-crosslinking rate of S-XLPE fit well with the first order reaction model. In addition, the molecular weight of de-cross-linked polyethylene (DXPE) decreased further as reaction temperature and reaction time increased when the reaction temperature exceeded 360 degrees C relative to that of the original polyethylene before being cross-linked. The decreasing molecular weight trend also fit well with the first order reaction model.

The rate of reduction was determined by weight change. The variations of activation energies and n values (JMA exponent) during the reduction conversion indicate that the methane combustion with CuO and Fe2O3 proceeds via a multistage reaction process. A kinetic model based on three parallel reactions was applied to the reduction data. The analysis of reduction showed that three reduction steps proceed simultaneously with the activation energies of 55.32 +/- 3.11, 70.0 +/- 2.0, and 165.0 +/- 5.4 kJ/mol, respectively.

Acceleration of Kinetic Monte Carlo Method for the Simulation of Free Radical Copolymerization through Scaling	INDUSTRIAL & ENGINEERING CHEMISTRY RESEARCH			English	Article							MOLECULAR-WEIGHT DISTRIBUTION; POLYMERIZATION PROCESSES; CHEMICAL-COMPOSITION; BUTYL ACRYLATE; STEADY-STATE; ALKYD PAINTS; SYSTEMS; METHACRYLATE; DISTRIBUTIONS; TERMINATION	Kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) has become a well-established technique for simulating the kinetics of free radical polymerization, both to generate polymer molecular weight distributions and, more recently, to track the explicit monomer sequence in every chain. However, KMC simulations require a minimal number of molecules in order to accurately describe monomer conversion and macromolecular quantities, which can render them computationally prohibitive. In this work, we propose a novel approach for accelerating KMC simulations through scaling relationships that allow the number of molecules simulated to be reduced. Using the concept of the minimal number of molecules and an explicit expression we derived for copolymerization, we propose a factor that is used to scale the reaction rate constants which results in an acceleration of KMC simulations by a factor of similar to 100. Furthermore, we demonstrate the limits of this scaling approach, revealing the absolute lower bound for the number of molecules used in KMC simulations of free radical polymerization and the associated population size of dead chains formed. We illustrate this approach using examples of acrylate copolymerization, but this approach is sufficiently general that it can be applied to a wide variety of free radical polymerization systems and even other free radical chemistries.

It is found that when 7 vol % cydohexane was added into alkali lignin (AL)/dioxane solution, LRM formed. When the cydohexane amount increased, LRM tended to aggregate and separate from the solutions. LRM films had a water contact angle higher than 80 degrees, in comparison to only 52 degrees of the AL film control sample. Due to hydrophobicity, the miscibility of LRM with high density polyethylene (HDPE) was significantly improved from that of AL with HDPE. Since LRM retained the phenolic hydroxyl structure of AL, the HDPE/LRM samples showed an excellent UV-absorbing performance. Furthermore, the added LRM had little negative influence, but significantly improved the HDPE mechanical properties. With 5 wt % LRM loading, Young's modulus increased from 1066 to 2104 MPa and the elongation at break increased from 671% to 1030%, respectively.

To this end, two customized setups are used, which are able to deal with the challenges associated with adsorption measurements under humid conditions. In the first part, the equilibrium of water vapor on activated carbon during adsorption and desorption at 45 degrees C is characterized. The equilibrium adsorbed amount of water vapor exhibits a pronounced hysteresis loop, requiring the use of an isotherm model with hysteresis to describe the data. In the second part, fixed-bed experiments for both adsorption and desorption conditions at three feed velocities are presented. These dynamic experiments are described by a nonisothermal detailed column model, which considers the linear driving force model for mass transfer and axial dispersion. Heat and mass transfer coefficients are estimated so as to describe the fixed-bed experiments. The results from the static and dynamic measurements are shown to be consistent with each other for both adsorption and desorption conditions, provided the hysteretic behavior of the adsorption equilibrium is considered. Finally, it is shown that the use of an average value for the mass transfer coefficient results in good agreement between experiment and simulation, and the improvement due to a more complex model is minimal.

This MCIL was impregnated into a porous PTFE polymer support, and the resulting supported membranes show higher O-2 sorption over N-2 with increasing loading levels of 1. The O-2/N-2 selectivity of these 1-impregnated membranes was determined to be as high as 26 +/- 8 at 25 degrees C when similar to 0.9 bar of feed gas pressure was applied. The absorbed O-2 can be removed by moderate heating of the samples from 25 degrees C to 60 degrees C in vacuo. The high level of O-2 sorption in these 1-impregnated membranes was maintained for at least five successive sorption/desorption cycles.

Hydrothermal Reactions of Biomolecules Relevant for Microalgae Liquefaction	INDUSTRIAL & ENGINEERING CHEMISTRY RESEARCH			English	Review							SUBCRITICAL WATER HYDROLYSIS; AMINO-ACID PRODUCTION; HOT COMPRESSED WATER; HIGH-PRESSURE WATER; SUPERCRITICAL WATER; HIGH-TEMPERATURE; FATTY-ACID; REACTION-KINETICS; NANNOCHLOROPSIS SP; FLOW REACTOR	Hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) of microalgae, a process that uses water at high temperature and high pressure to make a renewable crude bio-oil, is receiving increased attention. Understanding the governing reaction pathways for the biomolecules in the microalgae cell could lead to improved conversion processes. This review collects information pertinent to the behavior of microalgae biomolecules (e.g., proteins, polysaccharides, lipids, chlorophyll) and their hydrothermal decomposition products (e.g., amino acids, sugars, fatty acids) in high temperature water (HTW). We report on studies involving individual compounds and their mixtures. The mixture systems are particularly important as they move closer to mimicking the true chemistry of HTL of microalgae by providing opportunities for interactions between different molecules that would be present during HTL. Throughout this review, we highlight gaps in the understanding of different chemical reactions that may take place during HTL of microalgae.

Besides the transformation of the main elements iron and carbon, a large variety of other elements (present at low concentrations in different input materials) are undesirably inserted into blast furnaces. Heavy metals, such as chromium, nickel, lead, zinc, cadmium, and mercury, belong to these unwanted elements that are inserted. In the present paper, the behavior of these heavy metals in the blast furnace process has been investigated in detail, since they may influence the quality of the product, the byproduct, the process stability, and the environmental impact of hot metal production (e.g., emissions of heavy metals). Thereto, a detailed literature review has been carried out and its results have been subsequently compared with long-term investigations (over 3 years) conducted at an Austrian blast furnace. The results of the study indicate that nickel and chromium are very affine to the hot metal and thus to a large extent (>84%) transferred into it. Contrary to this, mercury and cadmium are mainly discharged via the top gas dust (>87%) and thus accumulate in the residues of the top gas cleaning system. For zinc and lead, no main discharge route could be detected. The results for lead and zinc varied considerably, which indicates the dependency of their transformation on the process conditions.

On the one hand, the introduction of acrylate monomers enhanced the hydrophobility of the sorbent, and the swelling of PP sorbent provided more spaces, which increased the sorption capacity. On the other hand, the diffusion channels were locked after saturation adsorption. Thus, the retention capacity was dramatically intensified. A reusability test revealed that the cross-linking layer also performed as a scaffold to sustain the inner fibrous structure, which improved the reusability. Also, the oil sorption and retention mechanism were systematically elucidated. The study proposed a potential method to fabricate fibrous sorbent and increase the oil sorption and retention capacity.

Deposition of Iron Oxide Nanoparticles onto an Oxidic Support Using a Novel Gas-Expanded Liquid Process to Produce Functional Fischer-Tropsch Synthesis Catalysts	INDUSTRIAL & ENGINEERING CHEMISTRY RESEARCH			English	Article							MAGNETITE NANOPARTICLES; SIZE-SELECTION; PARTICLE-SIZE; LOWER OLEFINS; NANOCRYSTALS; KINETICS; SEPARATION; STABILITY; FE3O4; MODEL	Gas expanded liquids (GXL) are solvent systems which enable the controlled deposition of presynthesized iron oxide nanoparticles, based on their size, onto a surface through the use of compressible gas such as CO2. By controlling the applied CO2 pressure, and hence the solvent strength, one can systematically deposit/precipitate nanoparticles of desired sizes. In this study, a technique using a GXL has been developed to controllably deposit iron oxide nanoparticles onto oxidic materials such as alumina and silica. The nanomaterials generated using this technique were then tested for their effectiveness as catalysts in Fischer-Tropsch (FT) synthesis in a fixed bed reactor system under standard low temperature FT conditions. The catalytic performance of these nanoscale iron FT catalysts was compared to control catalysts that were prepared by traditional incipient wetness methods using the same iron loading. Characterization of these GXL-synthesized materials demonstrated that the iron oxide nanoparticles were deposited in a size controlled manner onto the oxidic support. A CO conversion of 18% was observed using a silica catalyst generated using this GXL technique along with a 69% selectivity toward C5+ hydrocarbons. The nanoscale iron catalysts prepared by the GXL technique employed in this study exhibit weaker interactions between the iron oxide nanoparticles and the support material, offering a new strategy to investigate the effect of metal support interaction on the activity and selectivity of iron based FT synthesis catalysts.

Synthesis of Jet-Fuel Range Cycloalkanes from the Mixtures of Cyclopentanone and Butanal	INDUSTRIAL & ENGINEERING CHEMISTRY RESEARCH			English	Article							HIGH-QUALITY DIESEL; CATALYTIC CONVERSION; LIQUID ALKANES; GAMMA-VALEROLACTONE; METHYL KETONES; BIOMASS; HYDROGENATION; HEMICELLULOSE; CONDENSATION; CELLULOSE	High-density (0.82 g mL(-1)) jet-fuel range cycloalkanes were synthesized in high overall yields (similar to 80%) by the aldol condensation of cyclopentanone and butanal followed by hydrodeoxygenation (HDO). Among the investigated solid-base catalysts, magnesium aluminum hydrotalcite (MgAl-HT) exhibited the highest activity for the solvent-free aldol condensation of cyclopentanone and butanal. The excellent performance of MgAl-HT was rationalized by the synergism between strong base and weak acid sites on the surface of this material. The aldol condensation products were further hydrodeoxygenated to butylcyclopentane and 1,3-dibutylcyclopentane over the Ni/SiO2, Pd/SiO2, and bimetallic Ni Pd/SiO2 catalysts. Compared to the Ni/SiO2 and Pd/SiO2 catalysts, the bimetallic Ni-Pd/SiO2 catalyst exhibited higher activity for the solvent-free HDO reaction. Over the 4%Ni-1%Pd/SiO2 catalyst, high carbon yield (88.0%) of butylcyclopentane and 1,3-dibutylcyclopentane was achieved at 503 K. According to the characterization results, the excellent performance of Ni Pd/SiO2 catalyst can be explained by the formation of Ni-Pd alloy.

The as-prepared mesh allows oils (gasoline, diesel oil, engine oil) and organic solvents (hexane, liquid paraffin) to pass through and repels water. A separation device equipped with the multilayer 3D structure can continuously separate the aforementioned oils from oil water mixtures. The separation efficiency of continuous separation is more than 99.0 wt % and shows little decrease after 10 cycles.

In the present study, newer adsorbents and their potential-carbonaceous adsorbents derived from the whole fruit of Cassia fistula (Golden shower) have been reported for applications in environmental pollution control using natural, renewable biomass as precursor. The potential of different forms of the derived adsorbents produced by thermal and chemical activation was examined for two representative cases, desulfurization of transportation fuels and wastewater treatment. The adsorbents were characterized by FTIR, XRD, XPS, and SEM techniques that indicate specific characteristics useful as an adsorbent. A successful application in the real industrial wastewater treatment and comparison with well recognized commercial adsorbents clearly highlights the utility of the developed newer adsorbents in separation science and technology.

J	Zhang, SM; Wang, FL; Tan, S; Wang, S; Chang, YQ				Zhang, Shumei; Wang, Fuli; Tan, Shuai; Wang, Shu; Chang, Yuqing			Novel Monitoring Strategy Combining the Advantages of the Multiple Modeling Strategy and Gaussian Mixture Model for Multimode Processes	INDUSTRIAL & ENGINEERING CHEMISTRY RESEARCH			English	Article							INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS; BATCH PROCESSES; EXTERNAL ANALYSIS; OPERATING MODES; FAULT-DETECTION; PCA; IDENTIFICATION; ALGORITHMS; DIAGNOSIS; PHASE	The multiple modeling strategy and Gaussian mixture model (GMM) have been widely used to monitor multimode processes. On the basis of a deterministic view, multiple modeling strategy builds the specific model for each mode, which can extract more accurate information for monitoring. However, multiple modeling strategy is unable to deal with the situation in which the online mode information cannot be determined, and this condition easily leads to a severe error when an inappropriate model is used for monitoring. GMM builds a mixture model for the whole process from a probabilistic view. It unites all the models probabilistically for monitoring without having to identify the mode information. However, it may perform badly for some specific modes because some irrelevant models of other modes are introduced by GMM. Besides, it may not efficiently capture the local features especially for complex processes with transitional modes. In this paper, a novel monitoring strategy, which combines the advantages of multiple modeling strategies and GMM, is proposed for multimode processes. All possible models are probabilistically united for monitoring when the mode cannot be identified for sure. If the mode can be determined completely, the corresponding model is deterministically used for monitoring. To evaluate the feasibility and efficiency of the proposed method, the Tennessee Eastman challenge is demonstrated to compare the proposed method with multi-PCA and traditional GMM.

A term defined as the power efficiency factor (epsilon(-1)(jsg) (kg/W)) serves as an indication of the quantity of particles that could be suspended per unit of power consumed by the impeller. Accordingly, it was found that the epsilon(-1)(jsg) values can be maximized by operating the mixing tank with an optimum range of solids concentration, which is given as C-v approximate to 0.2-0.3 (v/v) for the systems studied in this work. It was observed that large mixed flow impellers were more energy-efficient when the tank was operated under aerated conditions with an optimum concentration of solids. A mathematical model was developed to predict the impeller specific power epsilon(jsg) (W/kg), which can be used to determine the optimum solids concentration in three-phase stirred vessels, and its predictions exhibited reasonable agreement with the experimental results.

A fixed-bed reactor was used to investigate the performance of the resulting catalysts in the transformation of methanol and residual fluid catalytic cracking (RFCC) gas to propylene and paraxylene. The resultant samples were characterized using the XRD, SEM, and BET techniques. X-ray diffraction analysis indicated the coexistence of WHx and CeO2 in the catalysts. Only at suitable methanol/RFCC gas ratios could relatively good propylene and aromatics yields be obtained. Addition of RFCC gas to methanol inhibits dry gas production while promoting the production of propylene and paraxylene and decreases the consumption of water. The methanol conversion, the propylene yield, and the paraxylene yield reached 100%, 69.5%, and 20.0%, respectively, under suitable conditions of a silica/alumina ratio of 150, a reaction temperature of 743 K, a space velocity of 10 h(-1), and an RFCC gas content of 9%.

Prior to soot loading, the sample was hydro-thermally aged at 850 degrees C. Flow reactor measurements were performed under various reaction conditions to examine the impact of soot in an SCR-coated diesel particulate filter (DPF) on standard SCR, fast SCR, NH3 oxidation, and NO oxidation. In the presence of soot, NOx conversion was slightly lower at 200-300 degrees C due to the blocking of active sites. However, at higher temperatures, the NOx conversion was somewhat higher with soot, indicating that soot more strongly inhibited the oxidation of NH3 than the SCR reaction. When feeding equal amounts of NO and NO2 together with NH3, ammonium nitrates on the sample were formed. The presence of soot significantly decreased the formation or the stability of ammonium nitrate, resulting in higher conversion with soot. To further understand this interesting aspect, ammonium nitrate formation and decomposition experiments using model Cu/BEA catalyst with and without soot were performed. It was observed that less N2O was formed in the presence of soot, and this in combination with COx formation during the ammonium nitrate formation step suggested that soot reacted with the ammonium nitrates, and we propose that this occurs on CuO species on the outside of the zeolite particles.

In the kinetic model, the influence of the catalyst on the reactivity is comprehended via steric constraints in the zeolite pores. Compared to gas-phase chemistry, reaction pathways with sterically demanding olefins are excluded from the reaction network because of these constraints. The number of estimated kinetic parameters is reduced by choosing operating conditions for which double-bond isomerization and skeletal isomerization are in thermodynamic equilibrium. Thus, only cracking and dimerization remain as rate-determining steps. The data set comprises 23 different experimental conditions being varied at different residence times. From this data set, significant kinetic parameters with small confidence intervals are determined. A good parity between model and experiment was obtained, which supports the applicability of the single-event methodology to the complex reactivity of olefins cracking on ZSM-5 and gives mechanistic insight into the reaction pathways leading to the product distribution. Furthermore, the possibility to use these kinetic parameters for extrapolation purposes beyond the experimentally covered range of reaction conditions is shown.

PTA@MIL-100(Fe or Cr) (beta) and PTA@MIL-101 (Fe or Cr) (beta) with different beta values (the molar ratio of W/M, where M = Fe or Cr) were prepared and characterized by XRD, BET, FT-IR, TG, SEM, TEM, and ICP. The research results showed that PTA@MIL-100(Fe or Cr)(beta) had a higher catalytic activity than PTA@MIL-101(Fe or Cr)(beta). PTA@MIL-100(Fe)(0.4) was the most effective among the studied catalysts and had excellent reusability. A 92.12% product yield and 93.01% selectivity for bisphenol F could be obtained over the PTA@MIL-100(Fe)(0.40) catalyst. The effects of the reaction time, reaction temperature, catalyst concentration, and phenol/formaldehyde molar ratio on the reaction performance were also investigated. A plausible mechanism for hydroxyalkylation of phenol with formaldehyde to bisphenol F was proposed.

At the upper layer dynamic and steady-state real-time optimizations (D-RTO and RTO) are suggested and compared. A novel multistage formulation for the real-time dynamic optimization problem is introduced. It relies on a purely economic objective without additional stabilizing terms and facilitates an integrated treatment of a sequence of alternating dynamic and stationary operational stages. A case study shows that closed-loop D-RTO allows reducing off-spec material as well as exploiting or rejecting disturbances to maximize overall profit. The computational delay not only determines closed-loop performance but also significantly impacts the profit margin. The results indicate that even the simplest variant of the investigated strategies can significantly improve economic performance, since the transitions can be completed much faster than in current industrial practice.

The gas antisolvent (GAS) process is one of the promising techniques and has been applied to many applications. However, control of the GAS process is a quite challenging problem and has not yet been studied due to the complex liquid vapor equilibrium and particle formation kinetics. This work proposes a batch-wise nonlinear model predictive control (BNMPC) approach to the GAS process to obtain the desired particle size distribution (PSD) of HMX, a widely used explosive, which should be small and uniform for stability. Although a dynamic model of the GAS crystallization is required for BNMPC, the previously developed model is too complex for real-time applications. We propose a model simplification strategy for the conventional model using experimental data. We also employ a high-resolution method (HEM) to solve effectively a partial differential equation (PDE). The simulation results show that BNMPC can produce more uniform and smaller HMX particles.

Multiscale, Multidomain Modeling and Parallel Computation: Application to Crystal Shape Evolution in Crystallization	INDUSTRIAL & ENGINEERING CHEMISTRY RESEARCH			English	Article							CONTINUOUS PROTEIN CRYSTALLIZATION; KINETIC MONTE-CARLO; THIN-FILM GROWTH; COPPER ELECTRODEPOSITION; BATCH CRYSTALLIZATION; MOLECULAR-DYNAMICS; SIMULATION; SYSTEMS; AGGREGATION; CHALLENGES	We focus on the development of a parallelized multiscale, multidomain modeling scheme that directly reduces computation time requirements without compromising the accuracy of established chemical models. Specifically, creating a parallel computation program from a sequential one consists of three steps: (1) decomposition of the original problem into tasks or domains, (2) assignment of tasks to processors, and (3) orchestration (using a programming mechanism) to communicate and synchronize the information flow among all processors involved. In this work, we applied a parallelized multiscale modeling strategy according to the above three steps to a multiscale model of a batch crystallization process. First, we decomposed the nucleation and crystal growth processes in a batch crystallization system into the collection of tasks where each task represents the crystal growth of a nucleated crystal. Second, the tasks (i.e., simulating the crystal growth of nucleated crystals) are assigned according to a modulus function where the number of crystal modules is equal to the number of processors available. Third, the message-passing interface (MPI) settings that use the information passing between the processors is used to link the macroscopic model (e.g., mass and energy balance equations describing continuous-phase variables) to the microscopic models (e.g., kinetic Monte Carlo model describing crystal nucleation, growth, and shape evolution). The parallelized multiscale simulation utilizes a manager worker MPI computational scheme: There is a processor (i.e., manager) that is responsible for decomposing an original sequential problem (e.g., multiscale model to simulate batch crystallization system) into a number of tasks (e.g., crystal growth of a group of crystals) and allocating those tasks to processors (i.e., workers). Workers are responsible for solving assigned tasks, and when a worker completes the simulation of an assigned task, it notifies the manager. Then, the manager allocates a new task to the processor. Before initiating their following task executions, all processors wait until they have received all the data computed by the other processors at the previous task execution step, allowing for a synchronization of the tasks over the processors used. Therefore, we are able to achieve a significant decrease in time required to complete the batch simulation as the number of cores is increased. A series of results demonstrating the computational efficiency of the approach using the batch crystallization process multiscale model are presented. Specifically, a linear speedup behavior is observed up to the use of 32 cores, and the maximum speedup of about 39-fold is achieved when we use 64 cores.

The TEM results indicated low dispersions of the active metals for Mo, NiMo, and CoMo, samples but significantly higher dispersion for the Ni sample. The effect of calcination and reduction on the hydrogen uptake capacity of the samples was investigated. The H-2-chemisorption and XPS results together showed that the precalcination step had a detrimental effect on the hydrogen absorption of the Ni sample formation of stable metal oxides. The XPS results revealed that the metal oxides of all calcined samples reached with the alumina support to form very stable spinels. Futher, the positive effects of a hydrogen atmosphere during the reduction, on the hyderogen uptake of the samples were cinfirmed by H-2-chemisorption measurements.

The results indicate that the crude oil and oil mixed with metallic additives, combusted in an air atmosphere, exhibit three different types of reactions defined as low-temperature oxidation (LTO), fuel deposition (FD), and high-temperature oxidation (HTO). Because of differences in individual catalytic activity and specific surface area effects, metallic additives exhibit varied catalytic effects on heavy oil oxidation. Meanwhile, the difference of activation energy reduction between LTO and HTO is analyzed in depth to present new insights into the catalytic effect of metallic additives on asphaltene and mechanistic understanding in terms of microscopic molecular structure. Through the combined analysis of thermal behavior and combustion kinetics, CuCl2 is found to be an excellent catalyst for upgrading the performance of an air injection project through positively influencing the oxidation reactions of Tahe heavy crude oil.

The well-known polyoxometalates (POMs) of H3PW12O40 (denoted as PW12) and H4SiW12O40 (denoted as SiW12) are effective catalysts for acid-catalyzed reactions. Nevertheless, industrial application of PW12 and SiW12 is largely restricted by the agglomeration, separation, leaching and recycling issues. Moreover, the PW12 and SiW12 tend to deactivate strong proton sites due to the small surface area of 10 m(2 center dot)g(-1). To overcome these problems, the PW12 and SiW12 have been fabricated onto a mesoporous polymer of PDVB-VBC (compound 1) with a large surface area via tris(2-aminoethyl)amine (TAEA), resulting in the formation of new heterogeneous catalysts of PDVB-VBC-TAEA-PW12 (compound 3) and PDVB-VBC-TAEA-SiW12 (compound 4). Both compounds 3 and 4 possess mesoporous structures with high surface area of 121 m(2 center dot)g(-1) and 131 m(2 center dot)g(-1), respectively. And they have shown highly efficient and selective dehydration of fructose to 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (5-HMF) in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) as well as esterification of lauric acid (LA) to methyl laurate. Moreover, the catalysts can be recycled for at least five times with no obvious decrease of reactivity. Therefore, such catalysts have great potential for further application from a chemical engineering point of view.

In water, only levulinic acid was formed, and its yield was 4954 mol % of the glucan in biomass or about half of the glucan was wasted forming byproducts including insoluble humins. In a 90 vol % methanol solution, methyl levulinate was the main product, and the yield of levulinates reached 66 mol %. Protecting glucose from humins formation by quick conversion into methyl glucosides was found to be the key to a high yield of levulinates. Methanol had little effect on formation of humins and levulinates from 5-hydroxymethylfurfural. In addition to the main reactions with glucose, 5-hydroxymethylfurfural, and levulinic acid, methanol was also consumed in other reactions that caused a substantial loss of methanol and presented a technical challenge to using methanol in biomass refining.

In this work, coprecipitates of beta-carotene (BC) and polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) have been successfully obtained using this technique. Nanostructured microparticles in the range 12.4 mu m were obtained, varying the polymer molecular weight (10 000 and 40 000 g/mol), the polymer/drug ratio (from 10/1 to 20/1), the operating pressure (from 85 to 100 bar), and the total concentration in the liquid solution (from 3 to 7 mg/mL). In particular, at 85 bar, 40 degrees C, 5 mg/mL, with a PVP/BC equal to 10/1, and using the polymer with the lower molecular weight, well-defined coprecipitated microparticles were obtained. Particles produced operating at these conditions showed a vitamin dissolution rate 10 times faster than the one of unprocessed BC, confirming the effective coprecipitation, and the increase of the beta-carotene dissolution rate. The precipitation process and the mechanisms involved are also discussed.

Application of Vapor Recompression to Heterogeneous Azeotropic Dividing-Wall Distillation Columns	INDUSTRIAL & ENGINEERING CHEMISTRY RESEARCH			English	Article							ACID DEHYDRATION SYSTEM; HEAT-PUMP; DESIGN; OPTIMIZATION	Although heterogeneous azeotropic dividing-wall distillation columns (HADWDCs) can achieve considerable reductions in capital investment and operating cost as compared to conventional heterogeneous azeotropic distillation systems, their steady-state performance is likely to be greatly enhanced by the application of vapor recompression heat pump (VRHP) technology owing to their unique process configuration of one top condenser and two bottom reboilers and favorable steady-state behavior of relatively small top-to-bottom temperature elevations. In the current work, the feasibility and effectiveness of reinforcing the HADWDC with the VRHP (HADWDC-VRHP) are examined. A systematic procedure is developed to effectively determine the optimum combination of the VRHP and the HADWDC in order to minimize the total annual cost. Two example systems for the separation of isopropyl alcohol and water and pyridine and water with cyclohexane and toluene as entrainers, respectively, are studied to evaluate the steady-state economics of the HADWDC-VRHP. It is shown that the proposed procedure can yield the most effective connection between the VRHP and the HADWDC (in terms of the number, locations, and heat duties of intermediate heat exchangers employed between them), and the resultant HADWDC-VRHP requires a considerably lower operating cost than the corresponding HADWDC. Although additional capital investment is needed, the reduction in operating cost generally leads to a reasonable payback time. These outcomes reflect the potential economic advantages of employing the VRHP in the synthesis and design of the HADWDC.

Alkali cations were found to modify the distribution and density of chemisorption sites resulting in higher CO2 adsorption capacities at 573 K (0.560.69 molCO(2)/kg) compared to the unpromoted adsorbents (0.29 molCO(2)/kg) (LDO and LDO/GO hybrids). The improved thermal stability imparted by incorporation of GO in the LDO was not compromised by the addition of any of the alkali species. Potassium produced the most marked enhancement in CO2 capacity (0.47 molCO(2)/mol alkali) due to its relatively strong Lewis basicity and even distribution on the surface of the adsorbents. Cesium was found to have a tendency to agglomerate that reduced the effectiveness of promotion. The CO2 adsorption equilibrium of the fresh calcined materials is described by the Freundlich model. After thermal adsorptiondesorption cycles the isotherms fit closer to the Langmuir isotherm.

Membrane gas absorption is a novel approach to minimize the SO2 emissions to the atmosphere. A comprehensive mass transfer model considering the nonwetting mode is proposed to observe the SO2 absorption performance. A physical solvent of H2O and a chemical solvent of N,N-dimethylaniline are utilized as the aqueous absorbents. The calculated results are verified against the available experimental data derived from two different modules, demonstrating a good consistency. The effects of the inside membrane diameter, membrane thickness, porosity, fiber length, number of fibers, and inside module diameter on removal of SO2 were simulated. The results show that an improvement in the absorption performance can be achieved by increasing the number of fibers and porosity, and decreasing the membrane thickness and inner contactor radius. Furthermore, a longer module length (corresponding to a higher gasliquid contact area) results in a sharp decline of the SO2 removal efficiency, while the SO2 flux increases. Finally, the model provides guidelines for the selection of optimum module parameters for SO2 absorption.

The surface modification of the membranes was confirmed by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and contact angle measurements. The membranes were also characterized by scanning electron microscopy, UF of proteins, and flux recovery. A membrane with the highest Pluronic (3 wt %) in PEI exhibited the highest pure water flux, highest water content, and lowest membrane hydraulic resistance. It exhibited high UF fluxes of 170 and 180 L m(2) h(1) at 345 kPa, for 1.0 g/L bovine serum albumin (BSA) in phosphate buffer solution and 1.0 g/L humic acid (HA) in deionized water feed solutions, with solute rejections of 84 and 82%, respectively. It also showed that the blended membranes with 3 wt % Pluronic content had a higher flux recovery ratio (92.4 and 89.4%), slightly higher reversible fouling (25.8 and 18.8%), and lower irreversible fouling (7.6 and 10.6%) after the UF of BSA and HA solute separation. This explained their low fouling behaviors compared to the neat PEI membranes.

A modified technique was used to enhance the reproducibility of the results and to account for the depletion effect which becomes critical at high mass-transfer rates. The volumetric mass transfer coefficient, k(L)a, was found to increase with increasing liquid superficial velocity and gas volume fraction and reached values as high as 4.08 s(1) at low specific energy consumption rates, particularly for slowly coalescent systems, a situation that is encountered in most industrially relevant systems. The gasliquid reactor/contactor presently investigated takes advantage of the coalescence retardation characteristics of most industrially relevant streams to achieve k(L)a values that surpassed those of most conventional reactor/contactors by more than an order of magnitude while maintaining a high energy utilization efficiency (up to 0.63 kg O-2/kWh). The ability to reach 98% equilibrium within residence times of less than 800 ms, achieved without significantly increasing the power consumption rates, allows for the use of static mixing reactor volumes that are several orders of magnitude smaller than conventional units such as mechanically agitated tanks and bubble columns.

Experimental Investigation on Interaction of Side Gas Injection with Gas Fluidized Bed Using gamma-Ray Transmission Technique	INDUSTRIAL & ENGINEERING CHEMISTRY RESEARCH			English	Article							INCLINED CONTINUOUS JETS; AIR; PENETRATION; COMBUSTION; BEHAVIOR; DENSITY; BUBBLE; HOLDUP; LENGTH; ANGLES	The present paper describes measurements of time-averaged voidage distribution in a pilot-scale fluidized bed using gamma-ray transmission technique. The voidage profiles in absence of side gas injection showed that the tracks of bubble flow change from one side of the wall to the center of the bed with increasing superficial gas velocity. The side gas injection can drastically alter the shape of the bed voidage distribution. At incipient fluidization the jet bubbles and distributor bubbles were found to be moving without interacting with each other. At 1.5u(mf) the jet bubbles and the distributor bubbles move from the wall to the central region of the bed with the increasing bed height above the nozzle plane.

J	Tsabet, E; Fradette, L				Tsabet, Emir; Fradette, Louis			Semiempirical Approach for Predicting the Mean Size of Solid-Stabilized Emulsions	INDUSTRIAL & ENGINEERING CHEMISTRY RESEARCH			English	Article							LIQUID-LIQUID DISPERSIONS; POPULATION BALANCE MODEL; OIL-WATER INTERFACE; DROP SIZE; PICKERING EMULSIONS; TURBULENT DISPERSIONS; BUBBLE COALESCENCE; CLAY PARTICLES; STIRRED-TANK; BREAKUP	The final mean droplet size of concentrated solid-stabilized emulsions was predicted using a semiempirical approach. The first step was to estimate the coverage and interface generation potentials. The coverage potential was predicted from the properties of the particles while the interface generation potential was predicted from the correlation developed by Calabrese et al. (1986), which was modified to include the effect of coalescence since the effects of high oil and particle concentrations on the breakage and coalescence processes are not accounted for in this correlation. The second step was to compare the coverage and interface generation potentials and to deduce the theoretical stabilized interface by assuming that it is governed by the lowest potential. The last step was to determine the effectively covered interface from the theoretical stabilized interface by considering stabilization efficiencies. The stabilization efficiency was defined by analyzing the stabilization process at the droplet and the individual particle scales. At the droplet scale, assuming that emulsions are stabilized by covering the droplets with a network of particles, coverage efficiency was defined by comparing the coverage rate to the coalescence rate. At the particle scale, assuming that the droplet coverage results from the attachment of individual particles, three other efficiencies were defined from the particle attachment steps: The particle and the droplet first enter into contact during the collision step; the three-phase contact line is then formed and evolves until reaching the equilibrium position at which the attachment force should be strong enough to avoid detachment. This multistep approach generated size predictions that were in good agreement with the experimental measurements for a broad range of viscosities, at different impeller speeds, and particle concentrations. This led to highlight the impact of operating conditions on the emulsification process. We show that it is possible to link emulsification systems to different geometries by taking the mechanisms driving the emulsification process into consideration suggesting new avenues for scaling up emulsification processes.

Excluding the simulated density, the highest values of the volumetric properties such as molar volume, isobaric expansion coefficient, and isothermal compressibility coefficient can be attributed to the largest cation incorporated with the weakest coordinating anion, [Tf2N](-), and the minimum of the corresponding properties correspond to the smallest cation, especially when combined with the smaller anions, including [NO3](-) and [Br](-). In addition, ion-pair, cationic, and anionic volumes were computed using MD simulations as well as ab initio calculations. The results revelaed an increasing trend in the molar enthalpy of vaporization. The reverse trends of the volumetric properties were observed for the cohesive energy density, Hildebrand solubility parameter, surface tension, surface excess enthalpy, lattice energy, thermal pressure, internal pressure, binding energy, and interaction energy. On the basis of the optimized structures, we believed that a reduction in the strength of the hydrogen bonds due to the larger charge distribution and steric hindrance of bulkier ions is responsible for the observed trends. These results were also confirmed by calculating the critical and boiling temperatures (by two different empirical equation), surface excess enthalpies, parachors, and standard molar entropies. The other derivatives of the thermodynamic properties such as the isobaric and isochoric heat capacities, isothermal bulk moduli, and speeds of sound in the ILs were computed as functions of temperature. Interestingly, a direct relationship was found between the simulated results for the surface tension and the computed values of the bulk modulus. Furthermore, it was found that sound waves are transmitted faster in a compact IL than in a compressible IL. In addition, for each IL, the molar refraction, refractive index, dielectric constant, and mean static polarizability were approximated at room temperature. The smallest values of these properties were observed for ILs composed of the spherically symmetric anions [PF6](-) and [BF4](-). In addition, the formation of multiple intramolecular hydrogen bonds between the O atoms of the ester functional group and the hydrogen atoms of the cation was also observed for all optimized conformations. Finally, the obtained results demonstrate that the introduction of an ester group significantly increases the interionic interactions and, subsequently, the packing efficiency of these ILs in comparison with those of conventional imidazolium-based ILs.

The isochoric multistep heating dissociation pressure search method is applied for experimentally determining the phase boundary between hydrate-liquid-vapor (H-L-V) phases and liquid-vapor (L-V) phases in the pressure and temperature ranges of 3.45-13.28 MPa and 274.3-287.6 K, respectively. All the studied IL aqueous solutions are used at a mass fraction of 0.1. A comparison of the thermodynamic inhibitory performance of various ILs is carried out and reveals the predominant role of the type of anion of ILs. Considering the difficulty in directly measuring the dissociation enthalpies, the values of Delta H of methane hydrate are also calculated using the Clausius-Clapeyron equation. It is found that the mean dissociation enthalpies of methane hydrate in the presence of the seven ILs vary from 59.05 to 60.81 kJ.mol(1), and are very close to that in pure water.

The problem is formulated as a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model that incorporates several distinguishing characteristics of dairy production, such as multistage bulk production, shelf-life requirements, intermediate storage, setups, resource speeds, limitations on minimum and maximum lot sizes, and the conservation of flow among various tanks. The objective is to maximize the total profit while determining the quantity of intermediate products and SKUs processed on various resources, the assignment of products to various resources and intermediate storage tanks, the quantity of each SKU sold, lost sales of each SKU, and waiting times. The determinations often reveal production bottlenecks. The efficiency of the proposed model is illustrated through its application to the milk production plant of a leading dairy company. Special features of the proposed model are highlighted through several examples. The computational performance of the MILP model is examined in several test scenarios.

The physicalchemical properties of the emulsion reactor and lignin were intensively studied using optical photo, dynamic light scattering, surface tension measurement, and hydrophilelipophile balance value determination. The results show that the emulsion reactor demonstrates a more significant process intensification effect on lignin depolymerization, with more than 29.60 mg g(-1) desired phenolic compounds obtained, which is about 3.3 times higher than that from a reactor without emulsification. Another advantage of this water/oil emulsion reactor is that both the organic solvent (n-butanol) and the ionic liquid catalyst can be recycled easily, as the depletion of lignin surfactant at the end of depolymerization can result in the phase partition and the enrichment of final products in the oil phase automatically.

A LangmuirHinshelwood mechanism with noncompetitive adsorption between hydrogen and the organic species is assumed. Gasliquid mass-transfer resistance is included in the model. Experiments were carried out in a stirred slurry reactor to estimate the kinetic parameters. The proposed model is able to predict the concentration profiles of the species involved during MBY hydrogenation, at varying temperatures (313-353 K), pressures (3.0-10.0 bar), and catalyst loadings (0.075-0.175 wt %). The model predictions were successfully validated using additional experimental runs conducted under different operating conditions and at a lower initial concentration of MBY.

The consistent valence force field (CVFF) was used to describe the interaction of the G4 PAMAM dendrimer and the interaction between the dendrimer and the AuNP. The many-body tight-binding potential was adopted to describe the atomic interaction between the Au atoms of an AuNP. Three AuNPs, Au-116, Au-201, and Au-405, with the diameters of 1.45, 1.8, and 2.3 nm were concerned, respectively. Au-116 and Au-201 are nearly completely covered by G4 PAMAM dendrimer, but the branching chains of the dendrimer are no longer able to wrap around the Au405.The conformation of G4 PAMAM dendrimer still possesses its unique spherical structure after encapsulating the AuNP, and the irregularity of the outer surface decreases as the size of the AuNP increases. For the thermal stability, it was found that the PAMAM dendrimer conducts thermal expansion when temperature increases from 298 K to about 600 K. At temperatures higher than 600 K, the dendrimer moves relative to the AuNP. It also can be seen that the melting points of PAMAM dendrimer-encapsulated AuNPs increase significantly when compared to bare AuNPs of the same size. This study would help us to clarify the characteristics and phenomenon of PAMAMAuNP composites, and these theoretical insights thus provide valuable information for future strategic design of new high-performance catalysts and nanosensors.

Simulation and Comparison of Operational Modes in Simulated Moving Bed Chromatography	INDUSTRIAL & ENGINEERING CHEMISTRY RESEARCH			English	Article							2-ZONE SMB/CHROMATOGRAPHY; CYCLIC MODULATION; VARICOL PROCESSES; SEPARATION; DESIGN; OPTIMIZATION; POWERFEED; SYSTEMS; 5-ZONE; FEED	This paper demonstrates a methodology for using Aspen Chromatography to simulate and compare several operational modes and their combinations in simulated moving bed (SMB) chromatography. After discussing briefly the basic SMB concepts, we introduce two bioprocesses, a binary chiral separation of Troger's base enantiomers and a ternary separation of amino acid mixture. We accomplish the binary separation in a 4-zone column, and the ternary separation in a 5-zone column. We simulate both separation systems under several SMB operational modes and their combinations. The specific operational modes include the asynchronous shifting of inlet/outlet ports (Varicol), varying feed flow rates (PowerFeed and Partial Feeding), and varying feed concentrations (ModiCon) within the switching interval, together with their combinations. We compare the simulation results in terms of purities and recoveries of both extract and raffinate products, along with other performance indices. Concentration profiles within the column provide a basis for comparison between operational modes, and give physical insights that explain why a given operational mode performs better or worse than the basic SMB. Our goal is to improve the performance of the basic SMB cases and expand the feasible separation regions of these systems by applying different operational modes. We propose guidelines for improving the performance of the operational modes of the studied systems, and present the improved separation regions where certain purity and recovery thresholds are met for various operational modes. For both binary and ternary separations, we can improve the separation performance with any of the investigated operational modes. Varicol improves the performance of the basic SMB, but is limited by its ability to fully increase all the component purities in both cases. PowerFeed gives only small improvements over the base case. ModiCon is the best overall single operation mode that is easy to operate and obtains much improved separation performance. The combined PowerFeed and ModiCon (PF&MC) is the best operational mode for both cases, yielding large improvements in product purity, recovery, and other performance indices. Adding Varicol to the PF&MC is not significant enough to recommend one over the others, and the slight improvement is not likely to be worth the increased complexity. To validate these observations further, we apply our recently developed Powell optimizer for dynamic simulations for use with Aspen Chromatography. We compare the improvements from operational modes in both 4-zone and 5-zone systems with smaller separation factors. Significantly, the qualitative rankings of the different operational mode improvement remain identical across the different performance indices between our heuristic improvement and Pareto optimization.

Modeling Fragrance Components Release from a Simplified Matrix Used in Toiletries and Household Products	INDUSTRIAL & ENGINEERING CHEMISTRY RESEARCH			English	Article							ODOR INTENSITY; LIQUID-MIXTURES; PERFUMERY RADAR; EVAPORATION; DESIGN; CLASSIFICATION; COEFFICIENTS; PERFORMANCE; CONSTANTS; TOOL	A new methodology based on Henrys law is proposed for modeling the release of fragrances from a simplified matrix commonly used in consumer products formulations. For that purpose, different mixtures were formulated containing one, two, three, or four fragrance ingredients diluted in dipropylene glycol (simplified matrix). Headspace concentrations were measured to estimate Henrys constants (H) for each fragrance component in all mixtures. The individual Henrys constants for multicomponent fragrance mixtures were also predicted from the ones measured for each single compound diluted in the matrix. Furthermore, we used a model that combines the UNIFAC group-contribution method with the modified Raoults law and the psychophysicals Stevens power law and strongest component model to predict the perceived odor intensity and character, respectively. Results showed a strong linear relationship between experimental H for single fragrances and experimental H for binary (r(2) = 0.998), ternary (r(2) = 0.997), and quaternary (r(2) = 0.996) fragrance mixtures. This new approach can bring a relevant advantage to the preformulation process by reducing time and cost associated with trial-and-error experiments.

This is attributed to the fact that the Sn within the gel network has a strong affinity for chemisorption of iodine to form SnI4. This study demonstrates an approach for consolidating the raw and iodine sorbed Sn2S3 chalcogels into a chalcogenide glass using GeS2 as a glass-forming additive.

The coating of PHBV on base paper was performed with two different methods, and the more effective one for lowering WVTR values was utilized for coating the PHBV/nanocomposites on the paper. Nanocomposites of PHBV were prepared with a commercial montmorillonite Cloisite30B (CS30B), and a novel modified clay was obtained via a solution-blending process. To prepare the series of modified clays, which were coined here as HPGC, MPGC, and LPGC, we intercalated beta-butyrolactone in the Cloisite30B clay by a ring-opening polymerization. The morphology of the clay and nanocomposites was revealed by X-ray diffraction. Additionally, the dispersion and phase behavior of the clay in the PHBV matrix was observed using a transmission electron microscope. It was found that the coating method and clay exfoliation were the most important factors affecting water vapor permeability. The water vapor barrier of the coated papers was improved significantly if the surface of the base substrate was prespray-coated with a PHBV suspension prior to the laminate coating of the PHBV film with a hot press. The papers coated with exfoliated PHBV/nanocomposites exhibited even lower WVTR values. Overall, PHBV, PHBV/CS30B, and PHBV/HPGC coating treatments lowered the WVTR values by 46, 56, and 118 times, respectively. The resulting coated paper is promising as a green-based packaging material due to an improved moisture barrier.

The Ag/AgCl interfacial layer was first introduced to the fiber surface via successive immersion in NaClO-HCl solution, AgNO3 solution, and NaBH4 solution, whose activating and anchoring abilities were then employed to coat an adhesive and uniform silver layer onto PSA fibers by electroless nanoplating. The obtained silverized PSA fibers possessed high electroconductivity, minor paramagnetism, excellent electromagnetic shielding effectiveness, outstanding tensile property, and thermostability, which were also resistant against sonication and exhibited good electroconductivity after exposure in air for half a year. They can act as electromagnetic interference shielding and static charge dissipation materials in coaxial cables and wear protection, which then show a wide application prospect in aerospace, telecommunications, and military industries.

The copolymer P(HPA) was synthesized by a facile free radical polymerization method using poly(ethylene glycol) methyl ether methacrylate (PEGMA), 2-hydroxyethyl acrylate (HEA), and N-(4-hydroxy-3-methoxy benzyl) acrylamide (HMBA) as monomers. The resultant copolymer was then incorporated into PES to prepare PES blend membranes by the classic NIPS method. Specifically, the effects of the P(HPA) amount and different copolymer composition in the casting solutions on the structure and properties of the modified membranes were investigated in detail. The surface hydrophilicity and antifouling property of the membranes were remarkably improved, which was demonstrated by surface wettability measurement and BSA filtration experiments. Moreover, the modified membranes showed excellent antibacterial capability against Escherichia coli because of the capsaicin-analogue moieties of HMBA. We believe that P(HPA), an ideal hydrophilic antifouling and antibacterial agent, will bring many potential applications in membranes for water treatment.

The gap metric theory, integrated into a neighborhood estimation algorithm, is utilized to partition the whole operating range into subregions corresponding to operating points. A local controller is then designed in each subregion and is composed of a constant feedback control and a receding infinite-horizon control with an estimated polyhedral stable region. To guarantee the global stability of the whole system, we design a novel switching rule activating between local controllers. The simulation study on a continuous stirred-tank reactor (CSTR) is presented to validate the proposed methods.

In this work, a rigorous process simulation of the complete industrial acetic acid solvent dehydration process is conducted. To achieve both the bottom- and top-product specifications, remove the accumulated p-xylene (PX), and recycle the methyl acetate (MA) despite feed flow rate disturbances, a suitable control strategy of this complete system is proposed. The control strategy requires only a side draw and organic reflux to control the tray temperatures of the dehydration column, the bottom heating steam to control the tray temperature of the PX purification column, and top-product reflux to control the tray temperature of the entrainer recovery column; this strategy can be easily implemented in industry for wider applications. From dynamic simulation and analysis, the control strategy can maintain the product purities, overcome the drawback of the PX imbalance, achieve the transition to the desired operation more quickly, and better maintain the stability of the overall solvent dehydration system under a disturbance in the upper-zone feed streams.

Optimal Campaign Continuous Manufacturing	INDUSTRIAL & ENGINEERING CHEMISTRY RESEARCH			English	Article							BATCH	Campaign continuous manufacturing (CM), characterized by relatively short operational windows such as a few weeks, is being explored as an alternative to traditional batch-wise manufacturing in the pharmaceutical industry. However, optimal operation in campaign CM can be challenging because of the significance of startup and shutdown phases, which can negatively affect on-specification production and plant economy. In this paper, the effectiveness and computational tractability of several known optimization approaches when applied to campaign CM are investigated. Inspired by the turnpike property in optimal control, a new approach is then proposed, which aims to maximize on-specification production explicitly rather than minimizing the startup/shutdown times as commonly adopted in high-volume industries. A main contribution in the new approach is that the resulting optimization formulation is guaranteed to be differentiable, despite the underlying hybrid dynamic system. Thus, it can be solved reliably using gradient-based algorithms. Case studies are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

The most feasible technology that can be developed at a commercial-scale in a short-term period is CO2 capture by absorption since it is an end-pipe technology that can be installed in existing coal-based power plants and will not require retrofit of the power plant. The most studied CO2 capture process is absorption using monoethanolamine (MEA) and represents the benchmark solvent because of the favorable properties it has shown such as fast kinetics, high absorption capacity, good solubility in water, and low price. On the other hand, this solvent is susceptible to thermal and chemical degradation, and it is also corrosive. Nevertheless, the main drawback of this solvent is the energy consumption needed for solvent recovery (almost >90% of the plants operating cost). Ionic liquids (IL) are new alternative solvents for CO2 capture. Experimental results have shown that IL feature chemical and thermal stability, and good CO2 absorption capacity. In this work, a theoretical IL is used as physical solvent for developing a new flow-sheet of a CO2 capture plant. A techno-economic analysis was carried out to evaluate the feasibility of the proposed design. The results show that the IL-based plant features lower energy demand compared to a traditional MEA-based plant. Moreover, the dynamic analysis performed in this study provides insight on the degree of nonlinearity and the dynamics of the process, which are essential tools to design suitable control schemes. The results show that the plant can accommodate perturbations in the flue gas flow rate up to +/- 10% while meeting CO2 recovery and purity targets.

We compare product yield and properties calculated by the swing-cut methods (fixed-cut, weight/volume transfer, and light/heavy) with results from the pseudocuts TBP-based method. The latter uses product yields and TBP curves computed via the hybrid distillation model. Swing-cut methods use assumptions which lead to lower accuracy of predicting yields vs hybrid model yields, resulting in errors in computed bulk product properties. If swing-cut methods yields are replaced by the correct yields from hybrid model, all four methods have approximately the same accuracy. Therefore, for a mixture of crudes, by using accurate yields from the hybrid model, product bulk properties can be computed by blending rules as simple as those used by the fixed-cut swing method.

To overcome this weakness, we studied the absorption of CO2 in alkanolamines dissolved in greener and nontoxic deep eutectic solvents. Among the alkanolamines in various deep eutectic solvent media, 2-amino-2-methyl-1-propanol in choline chloride: urea (1:2) medium was found to exhibit the highest absorption capacity for CO2 gas. In addition to that, the value-added product, 2-amino-2-methyl-1-propanol carbamate, was obtained from all deep eutectic solvent medium, which was analyzed by Fourier transform infrared and H-1 and 13C nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopic techniques. Under optimized conditions, the maximum yield of 82%, 2-amino-2-methyl-1-propanol carbamate was obtained. The deep eutectic solvent used for the process has been recovered and reused for 4 cycles. Thus, the 2-amino-2-methyl-1-propanol in deep eutectic solvent medium emerges to be a novel promising candidate for capture as well as for the utilization of the CO2 gas to obtain the value-added product.

This solution provides a thorough understanding for the type of isotherm investigated, which exhibits several interesting features. Depending on initial and feed compositions, the order of breakthrough and desorption changes at frontal analysis conditions, and a changing impact of component 1 (from competitive to cooperative) on the adsorption behavior of component 2 can be observed at displacement conditions. Furthermore, the equilibrium theory solution includes some rare transitions, such as semishock transitions with multiple shock and wave parts. Due to its interesting behavior, this isotherm is able to accurately describe an experimental system investigated in the context of the delta-shock phenomenon. With the aid of the derived equilibrium theory solution, it was possible to identify several types of transitions and intermediate states, and to fit isotherm parameters to experimental elution profiles. The interesting behavior accounted for by this type of isotherm, and its ability to describe a specific and peculiar experimental system, which had previously been misinterpreted, may motivate the future investigation of the entire class of generalized bi-Langmuir isotherms.

A 2D model of expanded supercritical fluid jet and unique calculation algorithms were developed and applied for the calculations. The calculations allowed determination of jet boundaries, shape, and position of normal and barrel shock waves, condensation front, and particles size distribution.

J	Hosseinifar, P; Jamshidi, S				Hosseinifar, Pouya; Jamshidi, Saeid			Determination of Perturbed-Chain Statistical Association Fluid Theory Parameters for Pure Substances, Single Carbon Number Groups, and Petroleum Fractions Using Cubic Equations of State Parameters	INDUSTRIAL & ENGINEERING CHEMISTRY RESEARCH			English	Article							DIRECTIONAL ATTRACTIVE FORCES; VAPOR-LIQUID-EQUILIBRIA; OF-STATE; SAFT EQUATION; N-ALKANES; PHYSICAL-PROPERTIES; PHASE-EQUILIBRIA; MOLECULES; PREDICTION; TEMPERATURES	A new-generation equation of state, perturbed-chain statistical association fluid theory (PC-SAFT), has attracted much attention to modeling the phase behavior of fluids using molecular-based equations of state. A set of three pure component parameters is needed for non-associative compounds, conventionally determined by fitting vapor pressure and liquid density data simultaneously. Unfortunately, experimental data are scarce, and the number of pure substances is too large. Thus, it is indispensable for developing predictive methods to determine the pure component parameters. In the present paper, a new model has been developed to estimate PC-SAFT parameters for different pure components, single carbon number (SCN) groups, and petroleum fractions through the connection established between classical and molecular corresponding states theories and creating a relationship between cubic equation-of-state parameters (critical pressure, critical temperature, and acentric factor) and PC-SAFT parameters. Accordingly, the proposed model requires five input parameters: critical pressure (P-c), critical temperature (T-c), acentric factor (omega), mass density at 288 K (Rho m*), and molecular weight (M-w). A comparison is performed between the proposed model and the existing correlations used to estimate pure component PC-SAFT parameters. Moreover, experimental vapor pressure and liquid phase density data of 53 pure substances from 14 diverse families of compounds (in addition to data applied for the development of model) were collected to verify the accuracy of parameters estimated by the proposed model in the calculation of vapor pressure and liquid phase density. Experimental bubble pressure and liquid density data of three oil samples were also collected in order to check the reliability of the proposed model in the estimation of PC-SAFT parameters for SCN groups and petroleum fractions. Results of the comparison show that the proposed model is capable of estimating PC-SAFT parameters for both pure substances and SCN groups with average absolute deviations less than 1.21% and 1.05% of saturation pressure and liquid density, respectively.

Hot gas injection into a colder bed that is slightly above minimum fluidization conditions is modeled in a 3D square bed containing up to 8 million particles. In this study, bubbles formed in monodisperse beds of different glass particle sizes (0.25, 0.5, 0.75, and 1 mm) and using hot-gas-injection temperatures ranging from 700 to 1100 K are analyzed. Bubble heat-transfer coefficients in 3D fluidized beds are reported and compared with theoretical predictions on the basis of the Davidson and Harrison model.	[Patil, A. V.; Peters, E. A. J.

The main interest was to obtain materials which are in a liquid-like state at room temperature (injectable form) and transform into a gel at physiological temperature. CS/PVA mixtures with different compositions in 0.2% and 2% AcAc were investigated in dilute solution at 37 degrees C by viscometry. The intrinsic viscosity was evaluated by a classical method (Huggins equation) as well as by using a recent approach reported in literature (Wolf model). On the basis of miscibility parameter (triangle b) and refractive index values, the miscibility between CS and PVA was discussed. Mixtures with total polymer concentration between 3% and 10% and optimum polymer composition have been submitted to freezing/thawing cycles, and their rheological behavior was investigated. The viscoelastic properties of CS/PVA hydrogels depend on the polymer total concentration and the freezing/thawing cycles number. The gel state is reached at lower temperatures as the number of freezing/thawing cycles increases.

Classical density functional theory is combined with the perturbed chain statistical associating fluid theory (PC-SAFT) equation of state to calculate continuous density profiles and (partial molar) enthalpy profiles across the interface. We follow the approach of Glavatskiy and Bedeaux [Glavatskiy, K.; Bedeaux, D. J. Chem. Phys. 2010, 133, 144709] where the resistivity for heat and mass transport and the coupled resistivities of an interface are obtained by integrating over local resistivities across an interface. This formalism is applied to pure component systems and to binary mixtures. We compare our results to previously published results from nonequilibrium molecular dynamic (NEMD) simulations for argon and n-octane. Two constant parameters have to be adjusted to NEMD simulations for each local resistivity profile. Very good agreement was found for both pure component systems. The results for binary mixtures are in very satisfying agreement to results from NEMD simulations. This study is the first to combine a physically based approach with integral relations not only for model fluids but also for real components and binary mixtures.

Different Preparation Process versus Performance of MnxOy/MCM-48 Sorbents for Hot Coal Gas Desulfurization	INDUSTRIAL & ENGINEERING CHEMISTRY RESEARCH			English	Article							REGENERABLE SORBENTS; SILICA; H2S; TEMPERATURE; MCM-48; STABILITY; NANOPARTICLES; ADSORPTION; PRECURSOR; CATALYSTS	In order to improve the desulfurization efficiency of 50% MnxOy/MCM-48 sorbent, the preparation parameters including synthesis method (excessive impregnation, precipitation, and solgel), precursor selection (Mn(Ac)(2) and Mn(NO3)(2)), heating rate during calcination (2 degrees/min, 4 degrees/min, 6 degrees/min, and 8 degrees/min), and calcination temperature (450 degrees C, 550 degrees C, 650 degrees C, and 750 degrees C) of sorbents were investigated systematically. The structure and composition of different sorbents were characterized by XRD, BET, TG/DSC, H2-TPR, UVvis, TPSR, and FT-IR techniques. The results indicated that synthesis methods and precursors influenced remarkably the dispersion of active particles while the stable structure of MCM-48 and the dispersion of active particles correlated closely with the heating rate during calcination and calcination temperature of sorbents, which will influence the desulfurization efficiency of sorbents. Therefore, the better dispersion of active particles and integrity of MCM-48 structure will result in better desulfurization performance of sorbents. Thus, the best condition was the calcination temperature of 550 degrees C with a heating rate of 2 degrees/min using Mn(Ac)(2) as precursor by a solgel method.	[Liu, B.

Results in the SRD process show that, in order to attain a reproducible and active behavior of the catalyst in successive reaction-regeneration cycles, a previous equilibrating treatment is required, consisting of a steam reforming reaction under high coke deposition conditions and subsequent coke combustion. Characterization results of the catalyst subjected to different treatments reveal that the equilibration and high activity of the catalyst are a consequence of the following structural changes: (i) the presence of water in the reaction medium gets the metallic copper redispersed within the spinel matrix; and (ii) coke deposition, followed by its combustion, is responsible for the structural change of the spinel from tetragonal to cubic and the redispersion of the spinel on the gamma-Al2O3 acid function.

The potential for functionalization of the composites for specific applications depends on the inorganic (silica) phase present. The synthesized composites were characterized by determining the percentage of organic content, particle size, surface area, and pore size and volume and the percentage of CO2 adsorbed to investigate the potential for specific application. The use of positively charged polymers resulted in a higher content of silica incorporated, leading to an increase in the composite particle size and a higher incorporation of the amine functional group.

J	Ishigami, T; Matsuyama, H				Ishigami, Toni; Matsuyama, Hideto			Multiscale Simulation Method for Flow and Mass-Transfer Characteristics in a Reverse Osmosis Membrane Module	INDUSTRIAL & ENGINEERING CHEMISTRY RESEARCH			English	Article							STEADY-STATE DESALINATION; SPACER-FILLED CHANNELS; SPIRAL WOUND MODULES; SEAWATER DESALINATION; PERFORMANCE; DESIGN; MODEL; PARAMETERS; GEOMETRY; PLANTS	This paper presents a numerical simulation method for calculating flow and mass-transfer characteristics in an entire membrane sheet module comprised of feed and permeate channels. The channels, including the spacers, were coarse-grained as the porous media for simulation of the entire membrane sheet. This is because the previous unit cell concept, which directly calculates the flow and solute concentration fields around the spacers, cannot be extended to the meter-sized computational domain owing to computational load limitations. We first carried out the unit cell simulation of the spacer-filled channel to obtain the flow and mass-transfer characteristics. The obtained flow and mass-transfer characteristics were then used for modeling porous media. The flow and solute mass fraction fields were then calculated for a membrane sheet, and the effect of the spacer arrangement on the membrane sheet performance was investigated. From the relationship between the pressure drop and water permeation rate, significantly different correlations were found for two parameters: the distance between the spacers and the angle between the spacers.

Subsequently, nickel nanoparticles were decorated on the synthesized hybrid material and used for the hydrogenation of phenylacetylene and its derivatives at room temperature under 100 psi of hydrogen pressure. The synthesized hybrid catalyst showed excellent catalytic activity and was readily recovered by centrifugation at the end of the reaction. The recovered catalyst was successfully used for several runs without any significant loss in the catalytic activity. Importantly, no leaching was observed during this course.

Separation and Catalysis of Carboxylates: Byproduct Reduction during the Alkylation with Dimethyl Carbonate	INDUSTRIAL & ENGINEERING CHEMISTRY RESEARCH			English	Article							STYRENE-DIVINYLBENZENE RESINS; CHEMICAL-EQUILIBRIUM; METHYLATING AGENTS; PHOSPHONIUM SALTS; REACTION-KINETICS; ACIDS; METHANOL; ESTERIFICATION; ESTERS; TRANSESTERIFICATION	Quaternary ammonium carboxylates (both ionic liquids and resins) can be used for formation of methyl carboxylate esters in an alkylation reaction with dimethyl carbonate (DMC). This reaction is pursued in the context of a low-waste process for recovery and upgrading of fermentative carboxylates. Byproducts, such as methanol, are produced during the alkylation reaction with DMC. A molar yield of Methyl acetate on acetate of 0.84 and modest selectivity (0.54-0.95 mol of methyl acetate/mol of methanol) are obtained with an anion exchanger fully in the acetate form. Water and DMC concentrations have a strong effect on the yield and selectivity of the reaction. Model calculations indicate that an excess of SO mol of DMCin/mol of acetate(in) in DMC is needed to achieve yields above 0.98 mol of methyl acetate/mol of acetatein, and water concentrations in the resin below 0.04 g of water/g of resin to achieve a selectivity above 1.1 mol of methyl acetate/mol of methanol. The explanation for the modest selectivity is the hydrolysis and absence of methylating activity of the methylcarbonate anion. This indicates that 1 mol of DMC is consumed for the alkylation of 1 mol of a monocarboxylate salt. The utilization of a low amount of DMC is critical, especially for low value products such as methyl acetate.	[Cabrera-Rodriguez, Carlos I.; van der Wielen, Luuk A. M.; Straathof, Adrie J.

Herein, we report production of high purity ultrapure water (18.5 L/h) by electrodeionization (EDI) technique in a laboratory scale EDI unit (effective membrane area 24 cm X 6 cm) using polyethylene interpolymer based ion-exchange membranes. The ultrapure water also prepared by EDI process in the same EDI unit using two different types of commercial membranes (Ionsep and Fujifilm type II). The resistance of ultrapure water was 18.2 M Omega cm with the interpolymer based membranes at 25 V/cell Pair applied potential, whereas with commercial Ionsep and Fujifilm type II membranes the final resistance of ultrapure water was 15 M Omega cm and 17.1 M Omega cm respectively at 30 V/cell pair applied potential. The power consumption (W) and current efficiency (CE) values were 0.324 KWhkg(-1) and 58.86% respectively for interpolymer based ion-exchange membranes, whereas for Ionsep and Fujifilm type IT membranes, Wand CE values were 0.658 and 043 KWhkg(-1) and 34.83% and 53.88%, respectively. The better quality of ultrapure water produced with interpolymer membrane and the better efficacy of the EDI process with the interpolymer membrane compared to other two membranes is ascribed to the lower water uptake, high transport number, and lower ion back diffusion through the farmer membrane.

J	Zhao, XL				Zhao, Xinglei			Study on the Mass-Transfer Performance of CO2 Absorbents with a Novel Chemical Regeneration Method	INDUSTRIAL & ENGINEERING CHEMISTRY RESEARCH			English	Article							CARBON-DIOXIDE; POWER-PLANTS; ABSORPTION; PACKINGS; CAPTURE	CO2 capture and storage (CCS) is a technology with potential for large reductions in CO2 emission to avoid dramatic consequences of global warming for the decades to come. The significant barrier for CCS deployment is the high energy consumption in the CO2 capture process from flue gas generated by coal-fired power plants. A new CO2 capture process was provided as the absorption product was separated in precipitation form and the slurry mostly containing the absorption product was directly sent to the stripper for regeneration, while the entire solution needed to be heated for regeneration prior to use in the next-round absorption in the traditional method. The energy demand for the novel process was evaluated to be about 60% compared with the traditional process using the 30 wt % monoethanolamine absorbent (U.S. Patent 8771403 B2). The impact of a novel regeneration method on the mass-transfer coefficient of several CO2 absorbents was investigated, and the reaction mechanism is presented in the current study. The preferable absorbent of K2CO3 + 1-(2-hydroxyethyl)piperazine for this novel process was recommended based on its good mass-transfer performance.

Condensed-Phase Ethanol Conversion to Higher Alcohols	INDUSTRIAL & ENGINEERING CHEMISTRY RESEARCH			English	Article							PHOSPHATE HYDROXYAPATITE CATALYSTS; SOLID-BASE CATALYSTS; N-BUTANOL; 1-BUTANOL; OXIDE; SELECTIVITY; PRESSURE; STATE; METAL	Higher alcohols (C-4(+)) can be formed from ethanol via condensation pathways. collectively known as Guerbet reactions. Most prior Guerbet reaction studies involve vapor-phase reactions, with n-butanol yields typically no higher than 30% of theoretical. We report here condensed-phase Guerbet reactions of ethanol over Ni/gamma-Al2O3 catalysts modified by La2O3. Higher alcohol selectivities in excess of 80% at 230 degrees C and autogenous pressures are obtained in batch autoclave reactions. At these conditions, which are near the critical temperature of ethanol, the liquid phase is significantly expanded, byproduct gases (CH4 and CO2) are significantly dissolved in the liquid phase, and the vapor phase contains significant quantities of alcohols. To accurately compute ethanol conversion and product yields, both composition and quantity of each phase present at reaction conditions must be determined. To do this, the SR-Polar equation of state is combined with chromatographic analysis of liquid-phase samples taken during reaction to model the phase equilibrium in the reactor at reaction conditions. Composition, density, and total number of moles of the vapor and liquid phases in the reactor are determined from the model and analysis, and they are used to calculate more accurate values of conversion and product yield than those calculated by liquid-phase samples alone.

The reaction mechanism of CaC2 formation in the microwave environment is explained and compared with that of the conventional method. The whole microwave process completed within 180 min because of efficient coupling of microwaves with graphite powder. X-ray diffraction quantitative analysis results revealed 71.8% CaC2 formation at 1700 degrees C for 30 min of microwave exposure, whereas conventional heat treatment at 1700 degrees C for 30 min showed 14.1% CaC2 and 1750 degrees C for 60 min showed 62.8% CaC2. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy quantitative chemical state analysis based on C is spectra indicated 54.02% CaC2 in microwave heat-treated samples and 30.75% CaC2 in conventional heat-treated samples. The preliminary experimental results suggest that synthesis of CaC2 by microwave reactor is fast because of rapid volumetric heating.

There was an excellent linear relationship between the SCR reaction rate and gaseous NO concentration, and the intercept and slope can be used to describe the rate constant of NO reduction through the Langmuir-Hinshelwood mechanism and that through the Eley-Rideal mechanism, respectively. However, the NSCR reaction rate was nearly independent of gaseous NO concentration, and the reaction order of the C-O reaction with respect to gaseous NO concentration was much less than zero. According to the kinetic study, the relationship of the SCR performance (i.e., SCR activity and N-2 selectivity) with the key factors (for example V2O5 content, H2O effect, and reactant concentration) was built, which can be used to predict the SCR performance.

Microstructure, Morphology, crystallization, and rheological properties of the nascent polyethylene were investigated by gel permeation chromatography, scanning electron microscope, differential scanning calorimetry, and rheometer, respectively. The polymer showed broad molecular weight distribution. We found that the synthesized UHMWPE had a weakly entangled state. The evolution of the weakly entangled state of the polymer was studied; however, it was found that the polymer synthesized in the initial stage of polymerization could be More entangled. Thus, poly[styrene-co-(acrylic acid)] (PS.) was coated on the surface of Cat-Fe/M to control the diffusion rate of ethylene, especially during the initial stage of polymerization. The decay rate of catalyst activity was decreased. The polymer synthesized at this stage then became more weakly entangled. The mechanism for achieving the weakly entangled state during polymerization was further discussed.

Experimental results indicate that zinc and manganese oxide can be integrated to form a good solid solution for effective adsorption of H2S. With an operating temperature of 600 degrees C and 200 ppm of H2S on the gas stream, the adsorption capacity of H2S achieved with 10 wt % Zn-Mn/gamma-Al2O3 (ZMA) reaches 52 mg S/g at a gas hourly space velocity (GHSV) of 20 000 h(-1). Additionally, kinetic study is conducted to evaluate the activation energy. Results indicate that the activation energy. of ZMA IS 51 kJ/mol and that the reaction rate constant increases with increasing temperature. In addition, the H2S adsorption capacity of ZMA would be significantly increased as CO2, H-2, and CO are added into the gas stream individually. In the regeneration process, the activity of ZMA can be completely recovered with air at the low regeneration temperature of 300 degrees C.

Dehydration and Rehydration of Polymeric Porous Media Studied by Molecular Dynamics Modeling and Simulations	INDUSTRIAL & ENGINEERING CHEMISTRY RESEARCH			English	Article							WATER-MACROMOLECULE INTERACTIONS; HIGH-SALT CONDITIONS; CHARGED BIOMOLECULES; FOOD DEHYDRATION; ADSORBENT MEDIA; FILMS; TEMPERATURE; PROTOTYPES; MONOLITHS; CAPTURE	The dehydration and rehydration phenomena of amylose-based polymeric porous media have been modeled and investigated using molecular dynamics modeling and simulations. As dehydration lowers the water level continuously, surface tension coupled with strong water polymer interactions exert downward stresses on the polymer chains and the pore structures and eventually cause them to result in reduced pore structures due to lack of sufficient steric support resulting from low polymer chain densities. Dehydration may also cause an exterior solvent phase to develop when the pore structures are formed by sufficiently flexible polymers and sufficiently low polymer densities. Strong water polymer interactions also make the magnitude of the energy requirement for dehydrating polymeric porous media not only substantially higher than pure water vaporization but the strength of the water polymer interactions also increases as dehydration-induced pore structural reduction advances to greater extents and the pore sizes become smaller. Furthermore, it causes the interaction energetics of the water molecules in the porous media to be highly nonuniform in the three spatial dimensions before and during dehydration. These results indicate that a single thermodynamic parameter like water activity determined from bulk experimental data is inadequate to represent the diverse energetic states of water in polymeric porous media and to capture the actual mechanisms underlying various phenomena and processes that are occurring in such media. Rehydration is found to expand slightly the dehydration-induced reduced structures of the porous media formed by flexible polymer chains and sufficiently low chain densities (low mutual steric support). The stability of the dehydrated polymeric porous media is provided mainly by the water molecules remaining in the pore structures and whose strong water polymer interactions "bind" the polymer chains together. Thus, the results of this work indicate that the behavior of the polymeric porous structure during rehydration depends on the dynamic evolution and final state of the dehydrated porous structure. The approach presented here could form a basis for the systematic evaluation of porous polymeric media and their stability from the extent of solvent polymer, solvent solvent, and polymer polymer interactions during wetting, dewetting, and rewetting.

Vishnu			Structure of the Carbonate-Intercalated Layered Double Hydroxides: A Reappraisal	INDUSTRIAL & ENGINEERING CHEMISTRY RESEARCH			English	Article							TRIVALENT CATIONS; CRYSTAL-STRUCTURE; CO2 CAPTURE; HYDROTALCITE; POLYTYPE	Carbonate-intercalated layered double hydroxides have hitherto been thought to crystallize with rhombohedral symmetry (space group R (3) over barm). This widely accepted structure model comprises positively charged metal hydroxide layers wherein the cations are disordered. However, spectroscopic studies and simple chemical considerations militate against the possibility of cation disorder. This study shows that the observed powder X-ray diffraction pattern can indeed be fit to a cation-ordered crystal with monoclinic symmetry. With use of the carbonate-intercalated layered double hydroxide of Zn and Al as an illustration, the structure of the layered double hydroxide is refined by the Rietveld method. The resulting structure (space group C2/m, a = root 3 X a(0); b = 3 X a(0); c similar to c(0)/3; beta similar to 103 degrees, where a(0) and c(0) are cell parameters of the cation-disordered structure) resolves many of the anomalies of the cation-disordered structure.

PLC is implemented directly on a chemical process simulator in dynamic mode to handle some uncertainty of the system. Also because accurate tuning of the fuzzy membership functions (MFs) is difficult and has an important effect on PLC performance, particle swarm optimization (PSO) is utilized. To display capability of this method, PLC is optimized with PSO. Next PSO-FLC is used to control pressure of a distillation column in an ethane plus recovery process in dynamic mode. Results show that the proposed method can use PSO-FLC in the Hysys dynamic efficiently.

To achieve performance improvements, DDKGLPP uses a data-dependent kernel rather than a conventional kernel. A unified kernel optimization framework-is developed to optimize the data-dependent kernel by minimizing a data structure preserving index. The optimized kernel can unfold both global and local data structures in the feature space. The data-dependent kernel principal component (DDKPCA) and data-dependent kernel locality preserving projections (DDKLPP) also can be developed wider the unified kernel optimization framework However, unlike DDKPCA and DDKLPP, DDKGLPP is able to preserve both global and local structures of the data set when performing dimensionality reduction. Consequently, DDKGLPP is more powerful in capturing useful data characteristics. A DDKGLPP-based monitoring method is then proposed for nonlinear processes. Its performance is tested in a simple nonlinear system and the Tennessee Eastman (TE) process. The results validate that the DDKGLPP-based method has much higher fault detection rates and better fault sensitivity than those methods based on KPCA, KGLPP, DDKPCA, and DDKLPP.

Experiments show that the optimized membrane preparation conditions for CO2/CH4 separation are different from those for CO2/N-2 separation, especially when operating at elevated pressures, which is considered for applications such as biogas upgrading. The effects of membrane preparation conditions were investigated and membrane CO2/CH4 separation performance was evaluated at elevated pressures (CO2 partial pressure up to 5.6 bar). Up-scaled flat sheet membranes (300 x 300 mm) were prepared using a dip coating procedure. The selection of the support substrate and aging of the membrane were also investigated. A CO2 permeance of up to 0.58 m(3)/ (m(2) h bar), and a CO2/CH4 selectivity of up to 45 were documented at 2 bar with 10% CO2 in feed gas. The membrane showed excellent stability over a 5-month test.

An effective CF formulation, i.e., iron chloride/anionic polyacrylamide (IC/APAM) = 800/100 ppm, has been identified to treat the NF concentrate stream. The challenges of membrane fouling and processing concentrate streams can be effectively managed by the integrated NF CF process. The NF process is able to achieve 82% and 67% removal of color and chemical oxygen demand (COD) from the colored wastewater, respectively; while the CF process can remove 91% of color and 81% of COD from the NF concentrate stream. NF and CF were found to complement each other. The NF process alone always generates a concentrate stream, but it can effectively reduce the wastewater volume. The CF processes are particularly favorable for treating small volume concentrate streams. These advantages make the NF CF process propitious for users located in land- or space-limited places and countries.

The presence and type of organic solvents used in the solution and in the resin, due to its pretreatment, affected the reduction of acidity and the adsorption rate as well as its catalytic activity. Adsorption of free fatty acids was further studied in two systems involving the resin drying step and the adsorbate dissolved in either vegetable oil alone or vegetable oil with hexane. The fitting of pseudo-first-order and pseudo-second-order models showed high coefficients of determination. Langmuir, Freundlich, and Temkin isotherms could describe the equilibrium data. The adsorption in this study is a spontaneous and endothermic process. The reported results highlight that Amberlyst A26 OH has good adsorption capacity for the free fatty acids contained in vegetable oils.	[Deboni, Taiana M.; Batista, Eduardo A.

In most cases, variations of PTMSP permeability due to the addition of filler are limited, while the ideal selectivity of CO2/He, CH4/He, and CH4/N-2 is slightly enhanced by addition of filler. Specific measurements indicate that the CO2 and CH4 diffusivity are more strongly affected by addition of graphene than their solubility: such behavior indicates that the filler modifies mainly the microstructure of the polymer rather than its interactions with the gas, as it is reasonable. The most significant quantitative effect observed after filler incorporation is the reduction of PTMSP aging, that was monitored by studying gas permeability after 9 months of aging at room temperature and after annealing at 200 degrees C. The reduction of aging observed after adding graphene is more significant than that obtained with large amounts (up to 20 vol %) of other inorganic fillers, like MgO and TiO2, even though the amount of filler added in this work is small (<1 wt %). Such behavior, coupled to the generally favorable effect of filler on gas permeability and selectivity, makes such materials extremely promising for real applications.

Study of Simultaneous Radionuclide Sorption by Mixture Design Methodology	INDUSTRIAL & ENGINEERING CHEMISTRY RESEARCH			English	Article							LIQUID RADIOACTIVE-WASTE; AQUEOUS-SOLUTIONS; NATURAL ZEOLITE; ANIMAL BONES; RED MUD; REMOVAL; CO2+; ADSORPTION; STRONTIUM; CESIUM	The problem of simultaneous removal of Co2+, Sr2+, and Cs+ ions from aqueous solutions was addressed using oxide, phosphate, and aluminosilicate materials from economical and abundant sources. Competition between cations was analyzed by the following approaches: (i) the addition of each sorbent separately to variously concentrated cation mixtures (using simplex lattice experimental design methodology), (ii) the application of mixture sorbents (using extreme vertices:experimental design), and consecutive addition of sorbents in varying order. Investigated materials exhibited different selectivity for Co2+ Sr2+, and CS+ in the mixture; thus combination of materials in one-step sorption, or successive addition of sorbents in a multistep process, lead to better removal efficiency.

In the current work, we have presented a novel and accurate model to predict the flash points of pure organic compounds from diverse families. The proposed model is a linear correlation between the flash point, normal boiling point, and 42 predefined functional groups constituting the molecule. Evaluation of the model through a data set of 1533 pure organic compounds shows an average absolute deviation, an average absolute relative error, and a correlation coefficient of 5.83, 1.61, and 0.992, respectively. Comparing the results of the present study with other works shows that the model proposed in this work is among the most accurate and reliable ones to date.

Polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP), a common macromolecular surfactant, was used to ensure sphericity and inhibit aggregation of the nanosized particles. The morphology of the support (60 nm), catalyst (80 nm), and PP particles (500 nm) were spherical, and the size distribution is uniform which is confirmed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscope (TEM), respectively. The laser granulometer results showed that the size of the prepared PP particles was in the range of 10-110 urn, and the average diameter was 36 um, which had potential application in 3D printing. In addition, the obtained polypropylene had low bulk density (0.170 g/mL).

J	Sudur, F; Orbey, N				Sudur, Fulya; Orbey, Nese			Properties of Hydrogen Peroxide Encapsulated in Silica Hydrogels and Xerogels	INDUSTRIAL & ENGINEERING CHEMISTRY RESEARCH			English	Article							STABILITY; DELIVERY; GEL	Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) was entrapped in silica hydrogels using the sol gel approach, and its transition to xerogel was studied by monitoring H2O2 retention as a function of weight loss at ambient temperature. The transition took place in different drying regimes, and the maximum H(2)O(2)concentration was obtained at 80% weight loss of the initial hydrogel. The stability of H2O2 at a higher initial concentration of 33.2 wt % was studied and found to be comparable to the values obtained with hydrogels having lower initial concentrations (10-20 wt %). The release rate of entrapped H2O2 from silica gel was studied as a function of the initial H2O2 concentration, the sodium content of the gel, the pH of the aqueous medium, and the form of the gel (hydrogel/xerogel). The release occurred via a hiphasic process, with an initial fast liberation during the first 10 min where 60-70% of the H2O2 was released, followed by a much slower release rate from 10 to 60 min. The release rate was independent of the initial H2O2 concentration but was affected significantly by the other parameters. Thermal stability of the silica gels was studied using thermogravimetric analysis, and was found to depend strongly on the sodium content. The form of the gel (hydrogel/xerogel) did not have an appreciable effect on the thermal stability. Substituting sodium partially with magnesium decreased the gelation time and increased the stability of entrapped H2O2.

Three main physical transitions are involved in self-structuring the grains of Suspension PVC: nucleation, aggregation and growth. All of these processes are affected by many physical transitions and chemical phenomena that are inter-related and many are;complex functions of polymerization conditions (i.e., agitation, temperature; stabilizers, etc.). Because of this multiscale complexity, the relationships between suspension polymerization conditions and morphology have yet to be well-understood. In spite of all these difficulties, a literature survey of the available research nevertheless provides a comprehensive and descriptive insight into mechanisms governing PVC particle formation accounting for the effect of the process variables.

A porosity of 98.1% was achieved with the technique of high internal phase emulsions (HIPEs). The porous monolith possessed hydrophobicity with a water contact angle of 142 degrees and absorbed oils from water selectively with an oil intake capacity of approximately 23 times its own mass. Incorporation of carbonyl iron powders (CIPs) enabled magnetism allowing the oil-soaked composite to be readily collected by a magnet. The composite saturated with oils could be regenerated by simple centrifugation, and the tests showed that the oil intake capacities were not impaired after 10 absorption/regeneration cycles. As Poly(St-DVB) is a low-cost traditional material and is easily manufactured in monolithic forms via direct molding and controlled polymerization, the added features make the porous Poly(St-DVB) composite a very competitive candidate for oil/water separation.

The CeCO3OH particles were blended with thermoplastic polyester elastomer (TPEE) and aluminum phosphinate (AlP) to fabricate the fire-retardant materials. Morphology analysis results indicated that CeCO3OH was uniformly dispersed in TPEE. Thermogravimetric analysis results demonstrated that the additives composed of CeCO3OH and AlP led to the slight reduction of thermal decomposition temperature and maximum mass loss rate of TPEE composites. Compared with neat TPEE, all the TPEE/AlP/CeCO3OH composites achieved the V-0 rating in Underwriters Laboratories (UL) 94 testing. Their limiting oxygen index values were also higher than those of neat TPEE and TPEE/AlP. In cone calorimetry testing, the peak heat release rate of TPEE/12AlP/3CeCO(3)OH decreased from 1190 kW/m(2) for neat TPEE to 530 kW/m(2) with a reduction of 55%. Residue analysis showed that the presence of CeCO3OH in TPEE/AlP promoted the formation of compact protective char layer resulting in the improved fire-resistant performance. The incorporation of CeCO3OH also enhanced the tensile properties of TPEE composites.

This;work aimed to reveal these principles by screening and comparing the preparation, chemical structure and composition, and curing and foaming performance of several types of ammonium Carbamates from typical amine curing agents. It is found that amines with pK(a) >9 are eligible to react with CO2 to form ammonium carbamates with a high yield. Furthermore, the amines should have rigid cyclic groups in their structures to form a solid ammonium carbonate powder, which can be easily mixed with epoxy resins. The curing rate of the amine should not be much faster than the decomposition of the carbamate to obtain epoxy foams with good pore morphology and mechanical performance.

During tape extrusion, the spherical dispersed phases were first elongated into rotational ellipsoidal or rodlike shapes and then merged to form longer and even endless microfibrils by coalescence, which were eventually squeezed into highly oriented ribbons. The speed of two running rollers has a large effect on the morphology development of the dispersed phase. With an increase of the roller surface speed, the stretching and squeezing forces increased dramatically. As a result, the dispersed phase gradually deformed from spherical to ellipsoidal, fibrous, and ribbonlike shapes. More interestingly, the tensile strength of the obtained blend film With highly oriented ribbons increased significantly as well. The viscosity ratio of the dispersed phase to the matrix is another important factor influencing the formation of a highly oriented polymer blend. It is found that a low viscosity ratio facilitates the deformation and coalescence of the dispersed phase to form highly oriented ribbons. Therefore, in order to prepare a well-controlled polymer blend with highly oriented ribbons, the combination of a high-viscosity matrix and a low-viscosity dispersed phase is preferred.

The Gas Anti Solvent (GAS) process is a recently developed process that can control the size and morphology of solid particles using supercritical fluids as an antisolvent to resrystallize desired products in solution. Though many lab-scale experiments with different choices of antisolvents exist, no study for the large-scale operation of such a system has been reported yet. This study proposes different design options of a GAS process for recrystallization of HMX (1,3,5,7-tetranitro-1,3,5,7-tetrazocane or cyclotetramethylenetetranitramine) using CO2 as an antisolvent. A detailed mathematical model for particle size distribution is integrated into the process flow sheet model. An optimal process which includes the particle size data of product and process specifications are proposed with economic evaluation and comparison of various alternative processes.

Onshore liquefied natural gas (LNG) production usually utilizes mixed refrigerant (MR)-based cycles for high efficiency, in terms of operating cost. This paper proposes a cascade process that uses nitrous oxide and nitrogen refrigerants. The liquefaction process can be subdivided into a precooling section in the vapor phase, a condensation section, and a subcooling section in the liquid phase. The vapor compression refrigeration cycle of nitrous oxide is applied to the precooling and the condensation sections, whereas the gas compression refrigeration cycle of nitrogen is applied to the subcooling section of LNG. The proposed process shows enhanced efficiency, compared to the conventional turbine-based processes with the specific power comparable to the MR processes.

Multiloop Control Strategies for a Dry Feeding Gasifier in the Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle	INDUSTRIAL & ENGINEERING CHEMISTRY RESEARCH			English	Article							ENTRAINED-FLOW GASIFIER; COAL-GASIFICATION; PHYSICAL-PROPERTIES; PROPERTIES RELEVANT; SHELL GASIFIER; SIMULATION; SLAGS; MODEL; BEHAVIOR; IGCC	Three control strategies for a dry feeding gasifier are studied. First examined is the fixed-ratio control strategy which keeps fixed ratios of the different feeds. Simulation results show that this strategy moves the system along a suboptimal path during load changes as the fixed ratios are selected for a steady-state operation. Two of the three chosen controlled variables (CVs) did not settle back to their set-points in the disturbance rejection test. To improve the performance, a new control strategy is proposed which adds additional loops to adjust the feed ratios in a cascade manner. Under this strategy, the set-points are well tracked and disturbances are rejected properly. The third strategy examines the necessity of the ratio controllers by breaking the ratio loops. While the strategy works reasonably, the chosen manipulated variable (MV)-CV pairings are counterintuitive. In the load change test, one of MVs is reduced to the lower limit and CVs fluctuate significantly.

The dynamic CO2/CH4 separation performances were evaluated in the fixed bed. CO2 working capacity and CO2/CH4 selectivity of PEI@UiO-66 at 338 K were up to 1.65 mmol/g and 111, respectively, being 12.7 and 58 times greater than those of the parent UiO-66, respectively. In the presence of water vapor in feed stream, the CO2 capacity and CO2/CH4 selectivity of PEI@UiO-66 separately reached values of 2.41 mmol/g and 251, respectively, at a relative humidity (RH) of 55% and 338 K, having increases of 48.8% and 126%, respectively, in comparison with those under dry conditions, which were higher than many MOF-based adsorbents. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations suggested that the presence of water vapor promoted CO2 adsorption, likely because of the formation of bicarbonate with a lower amine/CO2 ratio than that required under dry conditions. The multiple adsorption-regeneration tests suggested that CO2 adsorption capacity of PEI@UiO-66 can be fully recovered after regeneration.

The structure and properties of nanoparticles were characterized using nitrogen sorption, X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, and transmission electron microscopy. The NTNs have a size distribution with a particle size of mainly <100 run and have a Brunauer, Emmett, and Teller surface area of similar to 100 m(2) g(-1). The modified membranes were fabricated and investigated in terms of their pure water flux, solute rejection, and fouling resistance. The water permeability and molecular weight cutoffs (MWCOs) of membranes were determined under constant-pressure filtration in dead-end mode at 100 kPa. The membrane fouling resistance was characterized under co(n)stant flux operation using bovine serum albumin as a model foulant. The membranes were characterized in terms of morphology, porosity, pore size distribution, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, contact angle goniometry, surface free energy, and viscosity of the dope solution. Overall, the modified membrane showed increased wettability and reduced surface free energy and pore size. The modified UF membrane with 0.5 wt % NTN loading exhibited improved fouling resistance (fouling rate of 0.58 kPa/min compared to a rate of 0.70 kPa/min for the control membrane) with similar to 80% water flux recovery. The same membrane showed an similar to 20% increase in water flux, an improvement in MWCO, and a narrower pore size distribution.

However, no detailed information about the stability, solubility, and transformation behaviors of SPI forms has been reported. In this paper, two new forms of SPI, 1-propanol solvate and 2-propanol solvate, were found and characterized. The thermodynamic stability and solubility of form II and four alcohol solvates of SPI were investigated and determined. It was found that methanol solvate and ethanol solvate of SPI are relatively stable while 1-propanol solvate and 2-propanol solvate of SPI are metastable in corresponding solvents, and 1-propanol solvate and 2-propanol solvate of SPI would transform to form II in corresponding solvents. Furthermore, the transformation processes of 1-propanol solvate and 2-propanol solvate were in situ monitored by attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectroscopy and Raman spectroscopy and some offline tools such as microscopy and powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD). The reasons behind the transformation were explained by the enthalpy data of different solvates.

TO evaluate the Conceptual proposition, a series of flow tests have been conducted in a stratified micromodel. It is shown that the proposed treatment efficiently restrains saline water in the lower permeability layer and protects the higher permeable layer from undesired damage. The results indicate that being smart in water shutoff treatment is not only employing hart materials but engineering their application is the key for success.

Utilization of adsorbents appears to be an efficient way to overcome this matter. This study discusses the potential of a natural plant, called Azolla folliculoid, as a sorbent for cleanup of oil spills in seas and oceans. An experimental investigation is conducted using Azolla/water phase/oil containment systems. The characterization of the Azolla is conducted through various techniques such as transmission electron microscopy, Brunauer Emmett Teller (BET) analysis, and FT-IR spectroscopy. A systematic parametric sensitivity analysis is performed to comprehend the adsorption mechanism in this particular case. The results implied that the uptake capacity of Azolla in sea water is 10.2 g oil/g adsorbent for the engine oil and 5.3 g oil/g for the crude oil at T = 25 degrees C and pH = 8.3. The adsorption capacity of engine oil/salty water is higher compared to other mixtures. It was also found that there is an optimal adsorption rate of the temperature of 25 degrees C and pH of 9. This study reveals that Azolla leaf is an efficient, economic, and ecofriendly oil adsorbent for oil removal from the surface of water.

Two-Step Pyrolysis Process for Producing High Quality Bio-oils	INDUSTRIAL & ENGINEERING CHEMISTRY RESEARCH			English	Article							CATALYTIC FAST PYROLYSIS; PY-GC/MS; BIOMASS; CELLULOSE; COMPONENTS; LIGNIN; HEMICELLULOSE	A newly developed two-step pyrolysis process for the fractionation of lignocellulosic biomass components into sugar-rich and lignin-derived rich bio-oils by using pinewood as the feedstock has been studied. In the first step, biomass is pyrolyzed between 300 and 350 degrees C decomposing cellulose and hemicellulose fibers to produce bio-oil having significantly higher selectivities toward sugars and lower selectivities toward low molecular weight oxygenated compounds, such as organic acids, aldehydes, and ketones than those of bio-oil produced from the conventional one-step pyrolysis at 500 degrees C. In the second step, the lignin-rich biomass remaining was pyrolyzed in the presence of HZSM-5 catalyst to produce aromatic-rich bio-oil with low selectivity toward oxygenated compounds. Comparison with the conventional one-step 500 degrees C catalytic pyrolysis showed the advantage of biomass "heat pretreatment" in the first-step pyrolysis, which promoted the decomposition of lignin to monomeric phenolic compounds which were more easily converted to aromatics. Application of catalytic pyrolysis to both steps produced two bio-oil fractions, combined, having significantly higher selectivity toward aromatics and lower selectivity toward oxygenated compounds. Over the conventional one-step pyrolysis, by decomposing biomass components separately at different pyrolysis temperature levels, the developed two-step pyrolysis process allows more flexibility for producing bio-oils with specific composition of chemical moieties that meet the requirements for their desired end uses.

Hydroconversion of heavy oil was carried out in a stirred batch reactor at 425 degrees C, 50 bar (initial H-2 pressure), 900 rpm, and 60 min reaction time using a range of unsupported transition metal (Mo, Ni, and Fe) catalysts. The effect of metal nanoparticles (NPs) was evaluated in terms of product distribution, physical properties, and product quality. The produced coke and recovered catalysts were also studied. The levels of API gravity and viscosity of the upgraded oils observed with the NPs was approximately 21 degrees API and 108 cP compared with thermal cracking alone (24 degrees API and 53.5 cP); this moderate upgrade with NPs is due to the lack of cracking functionality offered by supports such as zeolite, alumina, or silica. However, it was found that the presence of dispersed NPs significantly suppressed coke formation: 4.4 wt % (MoS2), 5.7 wt % (NiO), and 6.8 wt % (Fe2O3) compared to 12 wt % obtained with thermal cracking alone. The results also showed that with dispersed unsupported metal NPs in sulfide form the middle distillate (177-343 degrees C) of the upgraded oil was improved, particularly with MoS2, which gave SO wt % relative to 43 wt % (thermal cracking) and 28 wt % (feed oil). The middle distillate yields for Fe2O3 and NiO are 47 and 49 wt %, respectively. Hence, iron and nickel-based unsupported NPs showed similar activity when compared to the activity of MoS2. The cost and availability of iron-based catalysts compared to those of Ni and Mo for heavy oil upgrading are advantages that may justify its preference. Furthermore, the X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analyses showed that introducing dispersed catalysts to the upgrading helped to produce sponge-type coke that could be used as industrial fuel compared to shot-type obtained upon thermal cracking.

Batch hydroformylation of several substrates including 1-octene, 1-decene, 1-dodecene and styrene showed good activity and selectivity. For 1-octene hydroformylation, the observed catalyst activity with the PDMS-based Rh complex is 2-fold greater compared to that with a conventional Rh-triphenylphosphine complex under similar conditions. Continuous 1-octene hydroformylation for up to 120 h was demonstrated in a membrane nanofiltration system, showing stable conversion (similar to 60%) and high chemoselectivity (>95%). The total turnover number (TON) after 120 h was approximately 12 000 and the permeate Rh concentration was <2 ppm.

Endothermic Reforming of n-Hexane on Metal (Pt, Ga) Containing H-ZSM-5 at High Pressures	INDUSTRIAL & ENGINEERING CHEMISTRY RESEARCH			English	Article							PROPANE AROMATIZATION; THERMAL-CRACKING; SUPERCRITICAL CONDITIONS; CATALYTIC CRACKING; HYDROCARBON FUELS; ZEOLITE CATALYSTS; AVIATION KEROSENE; ZSM-5; DODECANE; GALLIUM	The supercritical, high-pressure reaction of n-hexane over H-ZSM-5, with, and without the addition of Pt and Ga, has been studied for application to endothermic reforming in scramjet engines. The endothermicities of the reactions were determined from the product distributions. For unpromoted H-ZSM-5, the product distribution indicated that the endothermicity is low and decreases with increasing pressure. The addition of Ga to H-ZSM-5 has a relatively small effect on n-hexane conversion but significantly increases the endothermicity of the reaction by increasing the selectivity to form small aromatics. The H(Ga)-ZSM-5 catalyst showed no deactivation for at least 5 h at 633 K and 137 bar of n-hexane. By contrast, the addition of Pt had a minor effect on both the rate and the reaction endothermicity.

Limitations on Fluid Grid Sizing for Using Volume-Averaged Fluid Equations in Discrete Element Models of Fluidized Beds	INDUSTRIAL & ENGINEERING CHEMISTRY RESEARCH			English	Article							MAGNETIC-RESONANCE MEASUREMENTS; CYLINDRICAL COORDINATE SYSTEM; NUMERICAL-SIMULATION; GRANULAR TEMPERATURE; DEM-CFD; PARTICLE SIMULATION; SPOUTED BED; GAS; FLOW; OSCILLATIONS	Bubbling and slugging fluidization were simulated in 3D cylindrical fluidized beds using a discrete element model with computational fluid dynamics (DEM-CFD). A CFD grid was used in which the volume of all fluid cells was equal. Ninety simulations were conducted with different fluid grid cell lengths in the vertical (dz) and radial (dr) directions to determine at what fluid grid sizes, as compared to the particle diameter (d(p)), the volume-averaged fluid equations broke down and the predictions became physically unrealistic. Simulations were compared with experimental results for time-averaged particle velocities as well as frequencies of pressure oscillations and bubble eruptions. The theoretical predictions matched experimental results most accurately when dz = 3-4 d(p), with physically unrealistic predictions produced from grids with lower dz. Within the valid range of dz, variations of dr did not have a significant effect on the results.	[Boyce, Christopher M.; Holland, Daniel J.; Dennis, J.

A reactive compatibilizer-tracer is a compatibilizer precursor whose polymer chain bears reactive groups capable of reacting with at least one of the polymer components of a polymer blend. It also bears moieties capable of being analytically detected with great accuracy. This concept is shown for polystyrene (PS)/polyamide 6 (PA6) blends using a copolymer of styrene (St), 3-isopropenyl-alpha,alpha'-dimethylbenzene isocyanate (TMI), and 9-(methylaminomethyl)anthracene (MAMA) as a reactive compatibilizer-tracer (PS-TMI-MAMA). While its isocyanate groups are capable of reacting with the terminal group of the PA6 forming a graft copolymer of PS-g-PA6-MAMA, its anthracene moieties allow for measuring very small amounts of the reacted reactive compatibilizer-tracer or in situ formed graft copolymer by gel permeation chromatography (GPC) with an ultraviolet (UV) detector. The use of the reactive compatibilizer-tracer together with transit experiments provides a tool for studying reactive blending processes in a twin-screw extruder.

Graphitic Biocarbon from Metal-Catalyzed Hydrothermal Carbonization of Lignin	INDUSTRIAL & ENGINEERING CHEMISTRY RESEARCH			English	Article							CARBON AEROGELS; BIOMASS; SPECTROSCOPY; PERFORMANCE; CONVERSION; CHEMISTRY	Lignin is a high-volume byproduct from the pulp and paper industry and is currently burned to generate electricity and process heat. The industry has been searching for high value-added uses of lignin to improve the process economics. In addition, battery manufacturers are seeking nonfossil sources of graphitic carbon for environmental sustainability. In this work, lignin (which is a cross-linked polymer of phenols, a component of biomass) is converted into graphitic porous carbon using a two-step conversion. Lignin is first carbonized in water at 300 degrees C and 1500 psi to produce biochar, which is then graphitized using a metal nitrate catalyst at 900-1100 degrees C in an inert gas at 15 psi. Graphitization effectiveness of three different catalysts-iron, cobalt, and manganese nitrates-is examined. The product is analyzed for morphology, thermal stability, surface properties, and electrical conductivity. Both temperature and catalyst type influenced the degree of graphitization. A good quality graphitic carbon was obtained using catalysis by Mn(NO3)(2) at 900 degrees C and Co(NO3)(2) at 1100 degrees C.

The influences of absorbed dose and polymer loading on composite structure and properties were investigated. A moderate amount of PVOH (P4C6) is found to be optimum for fabricating mechanically strong PVOH composites; however, gamma irradiation has a positive influence on strengthening composites only with low PVOH content. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) observation shows a layered structure from the cross-section of a cryo-fractured surface for all composites, and a comparatively smooth surface. The wide-angle X-ray diffraction (WAXD) characterization shows an intercalated MMT structure with incorporation of PVOH. Cross-linking and the increase of clay content lead to a decreased onset decomposition temperature but an increase in the temperature at the maximum decomposition rate and enhancement of the residue of the resulting materials. The clay membranes possess very low flammability, which is not significantly influenced by gamma irradiation.

In the present study, with the goal of promoting silanization reactivity and extent, we utilize a phosphonium ionic liquid (PIL) as a novel catalyst for the silanization reaction between silica and bis(3-triethoxysilylpropyl)-tetrasulfide (TESPT), a commonly used silane in the tire industry, in the styrene-butadiene rubber (SBR) matrix. Dynamic rheological measurement, bound rubber measurement, freezing point depression, and heat capacity increment together show that the addition of a small amount of PIL into a TESPT-modified SBR/silica composite gives rise to significant improvement in the interfacial adhesion between silica and the rubber matrix, which is on account of the promoted silanization extent of silica with the catalyst of PIL. Consequently, the resulting composite prepared at room temperature with fewer parts of TESPT exhibits superior overall performance in comparison with the composites prepared by adding excessive TESPT and compounding at an elevated temperature. In particular, the energy loss during rolling of the rubber wheel is drastically decreased as a result of the improved interfacial silanization, which shows great potential in energy-saving green tires.

In this method, the direction matrix is introduced to describe the deviation direction of the uncertain parameter. Then by searching the critical directions that restrict the process flexibility with the simulated annealing algorithm, the flexibility index can be obtained. Since the directions are no longer limited to the vertices, this method can well deal with the nonconvex problems. Moreover, for large-scale problems, a decoupling strategy is developed to enhance the efficiency. On the basis of this, the entire network is decomposed into several independent subnetworks, and the one with the lowest flexibility decides the global flexibility index. Two examples are studied, and the results well demonstrate the various aspects dealt with in this work.

This can be improved by hydrophilic modification of the film surface through blending with hydrophilic polymers. For producing the precursor films and, consequently, microporous membranes with the appropriate crystalline lamellar morphology, the polypropylene chains should preserve their elongated form to serve as initial nuclei for the later development of lamellar crystals. The relaxation time of the chains is the most important factor for this stage. Commercial maleic anhydride and acrylic acid grafted polypropylenes were melt blended with a polypropylene at different weight ratios. The results showed that the modifiers lowered the crystalline orientation of the blends as compared to neat polypropylene films. The effect of the modifier on the melt relaxation spectra of the blends was investigated, and a linear relationship was found between the characteristic relaxation time of the blends and their crystalline orientation function.

The aerodynamic fields are computed using the k-omega model. The pneumatic process is considered based on the mathematical model of melt spinning in single-, thin-filament approximation. Simultaneous acceleration of the air and the melt within the nozzle leads to fast attenuation of the filament. Air velocity dominates velocity of the filament and results in continual air-drawing on the entire spinning line. Oriented crystallization and nonlinear viscoelasticity effects under fast uniaxial elongation of the polymer melt are considered. The filament velocity at the collector increases significantly with increasing air compression, from the values typical for high-speed melt spinning up to values by two folds higher. The increase in filament velocity is limited by the effects of online oriented crystallization at higher air compressions.

The objective of the tuning algorithm is to automatically determine the MPC tuning parameters such that (1) the robust stability can be guaranteed, (2) the worst-case overshoot is controlled, (3) the oscillations in process outputs are attenuated, and (4) the worst-case settling time is minimized. A rigorous robust stability analysis is first conducted based on the connection between parametric uncertainties and unstructured uncertainties, and a tight robust stability condition is derived. As the specification on process output variation is not easily made by the end users, two alternative methods are proposed to automatically determine the tolerable total variation, which lead to two automatic tuning algorithms that achieve the tuning objectives. The proposed results are tested and verified through examples extracted from industrial processes in the pulp and paper industry, and comparisons are made with other existing results.

Investigating Arrangement of Composite Drops in Two-Dimensional Microchannels Using Multiagent Simulations: A Design Perspective	INDUSTRIAL & ENGINEERING CHEMISTRY RESEARCH			English	Article							MICROFLUIDIC LADDER NETWORKS; FLOW-CYTOMETRY; DROPLETS; DEVICES; GENERATION; MICROPARTICLES; MICRODROPLETS; EMULSIONS; CHANNELS; MANIPULATION	Drops can self-organize in two-dimensional (2D) microchannels to form ordered arrangements. Design of microchannels that result in a particular pattern of drops for a specific purpose is difficult and nonintuitive due to the inherent complexity of the drop dynamics. We address the problem of understanding the arrangement of composite drops inside a microchannel. A multiagent modeling strategy that was recently proposed by us is employed to understand this complex design problem. We consider the design of a drop drop contactor that results in an equal mix of A and B. We seek to find the inlet sequence of drops A and B that would result in the maximum contact between A and B in the ordered arrangement. We find that intuition-based results work well only for a single layer arrangement of drops. We attribute this anomalous behavior to the symmetry breaking instability of the drop patterns in these 2D microchannels. From the dynamic simulations, we understand why certain inlet sequences perform better than others. We then discuss the use of the simulation strategy in several possible design problems.	[Raj, M.

The mechanism of the variations in these two physical properties was also explained in detail through a combination of experimental methods and simulation calculations. The results indicated that the densities of the conventional and functionalized ILs increased gradually with increasing amounts of SO2. However, the viscosities of two kinds of ILs during SO2 absorption showed different variation trends according to different mechanisms of SO2 absorption, i.e., physical absorption and chemical absorption, which was proven by the in situ Fourier transform infrared results. The viscosity changes of the functionalized IL [NEt2C2Py][SCN] during SO2 absorption experienced two stages. First, the viscosity increased sharply because of chemical interaction, forming a charge-transfer complex, and then decreased drastically because of the physical interaction between the anion and SO2. However, there was a monotonous and sharp decline in the viscosity of the conventional ILs with an increase of the SO2 capacity, which showed the same trend as that of [NEt2C2Py] [SCN] in the SO2 physical absorption stage. Furthermore, the ionic interaction and microstructures of the conventional ILs before and after SO2 absorption were further studied by molecular dynamics simulation and quantum-chemical calculation. It was demonstrated that viscosity reduction may mainly originate from a decrease of the electrostatic interaction between the cation and anion of the ILs because of the presence of SO2.

J	You, XQ; Rodriguez-Donis, I; Gerbaud, V				You, Xinqiang; Rodriguez-Donis, Ivonne; Gerbaud, Vincent			Investigation of Separation Efficiency Indicator for the Optimization of the Acetone-Methanol Extractive Distillation with Water	INDUSTRIAL & ENGINEERING CHEMISTRY RESEARCH			English	Article							HOMOGENEOUS AZEOTROPIC DISTILLATION; THERMODYNAMIC INSIGHTS; ENTRAINER; DESIGN; SYSTEM; FEASIBILITY; EQUILIBRIUM; DEHYDRATION; MIXTURES; DYNAMICS	A multiobjective genetic algorithm optimization of the extractive distillation process of acetone methanol minimum azeotropic mixture with heavy entrainer water is investigated. The process includes the extractive and entrainer regeneration columns, and the optimization minimizes the energy cost objective function (OF) and total annual cost (TAC) and maximizes efficiency indicators E-ext and e(ext) that describe the ability of the extractive section to discriminate the product between the top and the bottom of that section. Earlier work (You et al. Ind. Eng. Chem. Res. 2015, 54, 491) found that improvement of some designs in the literature led to an increase in those indicators. A two-step optimization strategy for extractive distillation is conducted to find suitable values of the entrainer feed flow rate, entrainer and azeotropic mixture feed locations, total number of trays, two reflux ratios, and two distillates in both the extractive column and the entrainer regeneration column. The first step relies upon the use of a nonsorted genetic algorithm (NSGA) with the four aforementioned criteria. Second, the best design taken from the GA Pareto front is further optimized focusing on decreasing the energy cost by using a sequential quadratic programming (SQP) method. In this way, the most suitable design with optimal efficiency indicators, low energy consumption, and low cost are obtained. Analyzed with respect to thermodynamic insights underlying the extractive section composition profile map, the Pareto front results show that there is maximum E-ext at given reflux ratio, and there is minimum reflux ratio for a given E-ext. There is an optimal efficiency indicator E-ext,E-opt which corresponds to the minimum TAC taken as the best design. In other words, E-ext,E-opt can be a criterion for the comparison between different designs for the same separating system. A SQP-based design is only <1% better in TAC than the best NSGA design, showing that this later method is able to find a consistent design for the extractive process concerning the 1.0-1a class mixture.

Numerous efforts have been undertaken to enhance the CO, capture property of HTlcs, including alkali-metal impregnation, use of support materials, and modification of chemical composition. The present work demonstrates the applicability of coal-derived graphitic material (CGM) as an effective support for neat as well as K2CO3-promoted Mg-Al HTlc, enhancing the CO, adsorption capacity. Both surface area and basic site density affect the adsorption capacity. The K2CO3-promoted CGM-supported Mg-Al HTlc exhibited a fresh adsorption capacity of 1.10 mmol g(-1) at 300 degrees C under a total pressure of 1 bar. After the initial drop, it maintained an average working capacity of 0.42 mmol g(-1) during nine cycles of adsorption desorption in the temperature range of 300-400 degrees C. The Yoon-Nelson kinetic model fit well with the experimental data.	[Bhatta, Lakshminarayana K.

A model for the cylinder-on-cone cyclone was presented to calculate the mean residence time of the liquid phase, based on a force balance on the wall film. This model was validated using an experiment, which measured the residence time of the liquid phase by the hold-up method. The results demonstrated that the predicted residence times are in good overall agreement with the measured values. Furthermore, the liquid residence time decreases obviously with increasing droplets loading, and decreases less with increasing inlet velocity. The liquid residence time increases with the cylinder diameter. The wall film velocity, however, decreases with increasing cylinder diameter, because the perimeter of liquid wall film is directly proportional to the cylinder diameter.

Calculations are performed to derive conditions of flow reversal, which is cited in literature as one of the requirements for removal of fouling layers. As wall shear stress is a relevant measure to evaluate removal of particle/fouling layers, calculations are performed to derive the conditions under which wall shear stress with superimposed oscillatory flow is energy efficient. The results are presented in the parameter space of a pressure gradient ratio (oscillatory/steady) and Womersley number. This phase plot would be useful for experimentalist to locate operating regions whence energy efficient removal can be achieved using superimposed oscillatory flow.

The group interaction parameters were estimated by correlating the solubility data of SO2 in ILs exhaustively collected from the articles published until July 2015. It was verified that both the UNIFAC model and GCLF EOS could be used for predicting the solubility of SO2 in ILs, but the UNIFAC model gives results that are better than those of GCLF EOS. The UNIFAC model then was used to identify the structure property relation for SO2 solubility and selectivity of CO, to SO2, whereas GCLF EOS was used to investigate the volume expansivity of ILs upon the addition of SO2. The results showed that volume expansivity is independent of the different combinations of cations and anions and exhibits a linear relationship with SO2 solubility in ILs.

In this study, laboratory experiments were performed to characterize the viscoelastic properties of MPEMs in brine water. A transparent sandpack micromodel was used to observe the microscopic flow and displacement mechanisms, and parallel-sandpack models were used to investigate the profile control and oil displacement performance using MPEMs in heterogeneous reservoirs. The results indicate that MPEMs almost do not increase the viscosity of injection water and can be conveniently injected using the original water injection pipelines. The microscopic profile control and oil displacement mechanisms of MPEMs in porous media mainly behave as selective-plugging in large pores, fluid diversion after MPEMs plugging, oil drainage caused by MPEMs breakthrough, and the mechanism of oil droplets converging into oil flow. MPEMs have a high plugging strength, which can tolerate a long-term water flushing. MPEMs can selectively enter and plug the large pores and pore-throats in high-permeability sandpack, but almost do not damage the low-permeability sandpack. MPEMs can effectively divert the water flow from the high-permeability sandpack to the low-permeability sandpack and improve the sweep efficiency of low-permeability sandpack and low-permeability area in the high-permeability sandpack. The results also confirm the dynamic process of profile control and oil displacement using MPEMs in heterogeneous reservoirs.

Thermal stability of TBAB was studied by differential scanning calorimetry and thermogravimetric analysis, and it was demonstrated that the maximum reaction temperature should not exceed 130 degrees C. Reaction conditions were optimum at 130 degrees C, 50 bar, with 3.5% mol of catalyst. The gas-liquid mass-transfer coefficient and solubility of CO, were determined by taking into account the nonideality of the gas phase using Peng-Robinson state equations. At 130 degrees C, the CO2 solubility was found to be independent from epoxide conversion and equal to 0.57 mol.L-1, and the gas liquid mass-transfer coefficient (k(L)a) decreases with the epoxide conversion, i.e., at 0% of conversion k(L)a = 0.0249 s(-1) and at 94% of conversion k(L)a = 0.0021 s(-1).

Owing to the triple helix structure, collagen exhibited important advances in the improvement of thermal and mechanical properties of poly(lactic acid) compared with other polymers. In our work, collagen molecules were covalently grafted on the poly(lactic acid) chains through the condensation of amino- and carboxyl- groups with the catalyzation of 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide hydrochloride. Moreover, the enthalpy of collagen/poly(lactic acid) materials was 30.09 J/g at the highest, compared to the enthalpy of 1.52 J/g for pure PLA. In addition, 88.60% improvement in tensile strength and 176.88% improvement in elongation at break were observed. The strategy for improving the properties of poly(lactic acid) by protein can be useful to develop high impact resistance of PLA-based composites and expand the application fields of PLA materials.

Sodium hypophosphite is a catalyst proven effective in the reactions of both acids. In order to find alternative catalysts, the mechanism of the direct esterification and the role of the catalyst in the reaction were investigated in this study. Several sodium salts of phosphorous acid and dichloroacetic acid with varied plc values were employed in the treatment of cotton fabric with 3,3',4,4'-benzophenone tetracarboxylic acid (BPTCA). The results confirmed that the overall reaction follows the Fischer esterification mechanism, an acid catalyzed reaction. The acid anions also play an important role in the reaction. Results of wrinkle recovery angles, FTIR band ratios of ester bonds, and thermogravimetric analyses of the treated fabrics consistently supported the mechanism.

P(AGE-DMDAAC)/ZnO composite was characterized by Fourier transformation infrared, X-ray diffraction, and transmission electron microscopy. The results showed that nano ZnO existed in the composite. P(AGE-DMDAAC)/ZnO was of M granular shapes with average diameter ranging from 70-100 nm. After the composite material was coated onto cotton fabrics, the surface morphology of the fabric was characterized by scanning electron microscope. The durability of the antimicrobial effects of cottons treated by P(AGE-DMDAAC) polymer and cottons treated by P(AGE-DMDAAC)/ZnO composite after washing 10 times (equivalent to household washing 50 times) was also evaluated against the bacterium Escherichia coli (E. coli, ATCC25922), Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus, ATCC25923), and the fungus Candida albicans (C. albicans, ATCC10231). P(AGE-DMDAAC)/ZnO treated cottons showed better antibacterial properties than P(AGE-DMDAAC) treated cottons against E. coli, S. aureus, and C. albicans. At the P(AGE-DMDAAC)/ZnO concentration of 25 g/L, the treated fabrics still had 98% antimicrobial properties against E. coli and S. aureus, and 75% antimicrobial properties against C. albicans after being washed 10 times.

Several performance evaluations such as intrinsic viscosity, temperature resistance, salt tolerance, and shear resistance were also conducted. Experiment results demonstrated that the introduced GnR could endow the copolymer with excellent salt tolerance capability and shear resistance ability. The superior salt tolerance performance of AM/GnR provided some clues to the synthesis of salt resistant polymer.

For this purpose, both flow mode and thixotropic mode were used to characterize the hydrogel rheological behavior, which was subsequently used to search for formulation/processability correlations during 3D printing of square cuboids. At a concentration of 2%, MFC displayed excellent printability, i.e., shear-thinning behavior with high yield stress and a viscoelastic response to a step-down shear rate variation. The addition of LS induced a drop in the yield stress, and above an LS mass fraction of 30%, the MFC/LS hydrogels displayed an inelastic thixotropic response with a drop in printability (viz., the printed cuboids underwent a continuous deformation until spreading of the hydrogel was complete). Above 50% LS, the high viscosity slowed the flow of the MFC/LS hydrogels, and the printed cuboids had minor deformation. Freeze and air drying of cuboids printed with LS mass fractions lower than 20% and higher than 50%, respectively, allowed the cuboids to keep their original shape, and their carbonization under inert gas led to the production of highly conducting objects. In line with the high density of the air-dried samples, carbonized samples displayed an irregular structure with pores and crackles generated during drying and carbonization, whereas the freeze-dried samples had the typical lamellar structure of ice-templated materials.

An Extended Constrained Total Least-Squares Method for the Identification of Genetic Networks from Noisy Measurements	INDUSTRIAL & ENGINEERING CHEMISTRY RESEARCH			English	Article							REGULATORY NETWORKS; SYSTEMS BIOLOGY; COMPOUND-MODE; EXPRESSION; INFERENCE; PERTURBATIONS; CELLS	We address the system identification problem of genetic networks using noisy and correlated time series data of gene expression level measurements. Least-squares (LS) is a commonly used method for the parameter estimation in the network reconstruction problems. The LS algorithm implicitly assumes that the measurement noise is confined only to the dependent variables. However, a discrete time model for the genetic network systems will lead to serially correlated noise terms that appear in both the dependent and independent variables. A constrained total least-squares algorithm (CTLS) used in signal and image processing applications showed significant improvements in such an estimation problem over the LS and total least-squares (TLS) methods. In this paper, we propose an extended CTLS algorithm that estimates parameters for all the dependent variables simultaneously, instead of estimating them separately for each dependent variable, as in the original CTLS algorithm. In addition, the CTLS algorithm is further generalized to assign weights to the error terms according to the variances or covariances of the measurement noise. We demonstrate its improved performance over the original CTLS method, as well as the commonly used LS and TLS methods on a widely adopted artificial genetic network example, under a variety of noise conditions.

An efficient parameter estimation methodology is proposed to avoid the difficulty of measuring essential kinetic parameters from experiments. By applying this methodology, the current study constructed an accurate dynamic model whose simulation results are highly comparable to the published experimental results. The current model finds that the starch generation pathway mainly competes with hydrogen production pathway, as its activity is enhanced by the cyclic electron flow pathway. From the dynamic sensitivity analysis, it is concluded that the most effective solution to enhance hydrogen production is to seek the optimal sulfur concentration in the culture, rather than to modify the activity of specific enzymes.

To facilitate its application, advanced dynamic models were built to simulate the complex effects of light intensity, light attenuation, and nitrate concentration on cell growth and pigment production. When these models were compared to the experimental results, their accuracy was verified in both batch and fed-batch processes. Three key findings are presented in this work. First, a noticeable difference between the optimal light intensity for cell growth (282 mu mol m(-2) s(-1)) and phycocyanin synthesis (137 mu mol m(-2) s(-1)) is identified. Second, light attenuation is demonstrated to be the primary factor causing the decrease of intracellular phycocyanin content instead of nitrate concentration in the fed-batch process, whereas it has no significant effect on total phycocyanin production. Finally, although high nitrate concentration can enhance cell growth, it is demonstrated to suppress intracellular phycocyanin accumulation in long-term operation.

It was found that the generation of a MgO-CuO solid solution was prevented in the presence of CeO2. So CuO had a better dispersion on the adsorbent surface and showed a better catalytic oxidation activity. At the same time, when CuO was added, oxygen defects were found increased greatly in the lattice of CeO2 by Raman spectra and in situ FTIR spectra analyses. This improved the oxygen adsorption capacity of the catalyst. High catalytic oxidation activity and oxygen adsorption capacity of the catalyst enormously promote oxidation of SO2 to SO3, which is much easier to adsorbed by spinel. The SO2 breakthrough time was doubled when the Mg-Al spinel was modified with both CuO and CeO2.

It was shown in our prior work that Pt has higher activity and stability for guaiacol hydrodeoxygenation as compared to other noble metal catalysts. In the present study, further theoretical and experimental investigations were conducted to reveal the reaction pathways and kinetics. For Pt/C catalyst in a fixed-bed reactor, the main liquid phase reaction products were phenol, catechol and cyclopentanone. Because cyclopentanone was typically not observed in the prior literature, a pathway for its formation was proposed and supported by density functional theory (DFT) calculations. By varying the space velocity, kinetic data was acquired in the temperature range 275 to 325 degrees C. The rate constants and activation energies for each subreaction in the network were obtained based on the power-law model.

Here, we present C-supported nanometric Fe and Co catalysts synthesized by plasma spraying, a method that contracts catalyst production into a single step, in contrast to traditional multistep catalyst production by precipitation or impregnation. The catalysts were reduced in situ and then tested for Fischer-Tropsch synthesis in a gas-solid fixed-bed reactor at 230 degrees C and 30-bar pressure for 24 h. The performance of plasma-synthesized catalysts was superior at a gas hourly space velocity of 6,000 mL.g(cat)(-1).h(-1), with Fe/C catalysts showing about 30% CO conversion per pass while Co/C catalysts yielded about 20% CO conversion. Identical C-supported Co and Fe catalysts prepared by impregnation or precipitation gave CO conversions of about 7% under similar reaction conditions.

APESP/APP/PP composites were prepared by melt-blending and extrusion in a twin-screw extruder with different loading levels of APESP. The combustion and thermal behaviors were investigated based on the limiting oxygen index, UL-94, and cone calorimeter test as well as thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). Then, TGA coupled with Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy was used to probe the degradation mechanism of APESP/APP/PP composites. The results indicated that a good flame-retardant performance could be achieved by incorporating APES? with APP in PP. The synergistic effect between APES? and APP was observed and is discussed here. The mechanical properties and rheological behaviors of APESP/APP/PP composites indicated that APESP significantly contributed to the dispersion and distribution of APP in the PP matrix and remarkably improved the elongation at break The morphology of APESP/APP/PP composites was investigated using scanning electron microscopy, and the profiles indicated that APESP enhanced the compatibility of the APP/PP system, which was verified by the blending energy and Flory-Huggins parameter (chi) values of APP, APES?, and PP in a multiple-scale simulation.

Wastewater contaminated by oil or organic solvents has become a serious environmental issue nowadays. Herein, a well-defined thermosensitive block copolymer was designed and used for controllable water/oil separation. The functional material poly(2,2,3,4,4,4-hexafluorobutyl methacrylate)-block-poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) was synthesized through a new environmentally benign "living" radical polymerization technique [i.e., photoinitiated atom-transfer radical polymerization (photoATRP)]. The synthesized functional copolymer was considered as a modifier for fabricating a smart surface with thermal-responsive wettability. The switchable mechanism, surface composition, and morphology of the as-fabricated surface were investigated by water contact-angle measurement, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and atomic force microscopy. Results showed that the as-fabricated surface can reversibly switch between the hydrophilicity and hydrophobicity, which results from the synergistic effect of surface chemical composition, reorientation of the functional groups, and roughness in response to the temperature. On the basis of mechanism understanding, a smart separation device was constructed and used for separating water/oil mixtures. The separation of a water/hexane layered mixture has high penetration fluxes of 2.50 L s(-1) m(-2) for water and 2.78 L s(-1) m(-2) for hexane, while exhibiting a good efficiency of over 98%.

The particle size and density of the Bi precursors were affected by the amount (or concentration) of Zn2+ ions added. The structural evolution of BiVO4 was consistent with that of the Bi precursor particles. An optimal concentration of Zn2+ ions resulted in smaller particle sizes and produced appropriate interparticle spacing of BiVO4 photoanodes, which possessed enhanced photocurrent and improved charge separation efficiency. The enhancement is mostly ascribed to the suppression of carrier recombination in the bulk This work demonstrates an effective way to adjust the structure and the subsequent photoelectrochemical performance of BiVO4 photoanodes by a cation-tuned Bi precursor strategy without the use of hard templates or complex directing agents.

J	Khadem, SA; Boozarjomehry, RB				Khadem, Sayyed Ahmad; Boozarjomehry, Ramin Bozorgmehry			Development of Systematic Framework for an Intelligent Decision Support System in Gas Transmission Network	INDUSTRIAL & ENGINEERING CHEMISTRY RESEARCH			English	Article							CHEMICAL-PROCESSES; FAULT-DIAGNOSIS; SIGNED DIGRAPHS; SIMULATION; MANAGEMENT	In a gas transmission network (GTN), faults can easily propagate due to the interconnections of streams. The main objective of this paper is to develop a systematic framework for an online decision support system (DSS) in order to make the right decisions to get the GTN out of critical conditions (which cannot be handled by the plant controllers) smoothly. One of the key features of the proposed scheme is its lack of dependence on prior knowledge of the fault signals (e.g., number of faults, and their origin). In this article, the GTN is modeled by a fuzzy directed graph (FDG). The proposed approach utilizes a reasoning algorithm based on the deviations that exist in the process variables (attributes) of target nodes, in order to detect the most crucial attributes (equipment) whose manipulating variables can be changed appropriately (i.e., upward or downward) to get the GTN out of the abnormal condition gracefully. Thereafter, quantitative decisions are made from qualitative decisions, after which the forward reasoning is used to determine the impact of each quantitative decision on the attributes of target nodes. The attributes of the affected nodes are obtained based on their estimations by a fuzzy inference system (FIS) through traversing from affecting nodes to other nodes in a sequential manner. To keep the generality and flexibility of the proposed scheme, FIS uses preliminary intuitive rules between two connected nodes rather than empirical rules for the entire GTN. Eventually, all tentative feasible decisions are built. These feasible decisions get ranked and prioritized through an analytic hierarchy process method. The decision set with highest priority is then implemented whose effect on the GTN operation is assessed, and if it seems the GTN still requires some changes to get out of an abnormal situation, once again DSS is invoked based on the newly established condition and the appropriate set of decision is obtained accordingly. The performance of the proposed scheme is shown by its application for two GTNs as benchmarks. It is capable not only of offering decisions to alleviate an abnormal condition but also of leading the plant to a new desired state from a normal condition.

However, there is no universal model that can completely satisfy industrial needs due to the complexity of the agglomeration process and the unclear mechanisms of particle growth. A systematic approach using an artificial neural network (ANN) model to predict PSD parameters of different agglomeration processes in high shear mixer was developed. In order to reduce input dimensions, several dimensional or dimensionless parameter groups are defined to represent the raw material properties, equipment geometries, and operation conditions as inputs. According to statistical analysis, an ANN model combined with the key parameter definitions can predict product mean particle size (MPS) within an average absolute relative error (AARE) of 7.18%, a standard deviation (sigma) of 7.72%, and a correlation coefficient (R) of 0.9657 (while for distribution span prediction AARE is 5.76%, sigma is 5.88%, and R is 0.9759). The results demonstrate that the ANN model developed in this work can predict the product PSD parameters with good accuracy over a wide range of operating conditions, material properties, and equipment scales.

Hydrodesulfurization (HDS) is the current method used for desulfurization and faces technical challenges, due to the extreme conditions and energy consumption necessary to reach low sulfur levels. Recently, ionic liquid (IL) technology has been proposed as a possible solution toward achieving ULSD. ILs represent a new class of "green" solvents that are gaining popularity due to their favorable properties and have recently been shown to be effective extractants for desulfurization on a laboratory scale. In this work, the feasibility of industrial scale IL-extractive processing of ULSD has been examined via the simulation and optimization of a conceptual process in ASPEN Plus. The widely used [C(n)mim] [NTF2] series of ionic liquids have been employed, due to their favorable properties and the availability of experimental data in literature. User-defined ionic liquid components have been created within ASPEN Plus, incorporating several thermodynamic and physical property parameters derived from literature, to allow the process to be simulated via the UNIFAC thermodynamic method. On the basis of the technical analysis, it is proposed that the most feasible process configuration consists of HDS as a preliminary treatment, followed by IL extraction as intermediate treatment to reduce the sulfur content to SO ppm, with adsorption as the final treatment to achieve ULSD levels.

Over the past 30+ years, this fertile paradigm has brought forth scores of research publications and has witnessed diverse applications ranging from bioprocess optimization and control to the redesign of cellular hosts through rational metabolic engineering. This review traces the historical development of the cybernetic modeling framework, beginning with its philosophical presuppositions and then following its progress from first-generation "lumped" cybernetic models to biochemically detailed second-generation models to recent "hybrid" cybernetic models that combine aspects of both first- and second-generation models. The broad and lasting influence of the cybernetic modeling approach is due in large part to the fact that it has remained true to its foundational principles while adapting over time to meet the changing demands of biotechnology research.

Reassessing the Progress in the Production of Advanced Biofuels in the Current Competitive Environment and Beyond: What Are the Successes and Where Progress Eludes Us and Why	INDUSTRIAL & ENGINEERING CHEMISTRY RESEARCH			English	Review							ACETOBUTYLICUM ATCC 824; CLOSTRIDIUM-ACETOBUTYLICUM; ESCHERICHIA-COLI; MICROBIAL-PRODUCTION; SACCHAROMYCES-CEREVISIAE; FERMENTATIVE PRODUCTION; ENZYMATIC-HYDROLYSIS; TOXIC-CHEMICALS; DOWN-REGULATION; GENOMIC SPACE	The concept, science, and technology of biofuels has captured the public's imagination as well as the attention of the academic and industrial R&D communities over the last 10 years. The 2006 US DOE report has been the basis for funding three US Bioenergy Centers, and has precipitated increased research funding worldwide. Despite the large funding resources, there is little evidence to support that processes for advanced biofuels (i.e., fuel molecules more dense than ethanol) are anywhere near achieving economic feasibility. In assessing the current status of the field for biology-based processes, there has been tremendous progress in metabolic and pathway engineering and the development of synthetic-biology tools that can be applied to engineer strains. However, the economic feasibility of what is currently possible remains in doubt, especially in light of the recent low prices of oil and natural gas. Issues liming the economic feasibility are assessed and strategies to take advantage of the successful achievements are suggested. Analysis suggests that for biofuel molecules larger than four carbons, purely biological processes cannot be currently justified, but hybrid biological/catalytic technologies may offer the necessary economies to produce such biofuels.

Cybernetic Modeling Revisited: A Method for Inferring the Cybernetic Variables u(i) from Experimental Data	INDUSTRIAL & ENGINEERING CHEMISTRY RESEARCH			English	Article							MULTIPLE SUBSTRATE ENVIRONMENT; MICROBIAL-GROWTH; ADAPTIVE PREDICTION; ESCHERICHIA-COLI; BACTERIAL-GROWTH; MICROORGANISMS; EXPRESSION; KINETICS; STRATEGY; BEHAVIOR	The cybernetic modeling framework for the growth of microorganisms provides for an elegant methodology to account for the unknown regulatory phenomena through the use of cybernetic variables for enzyme induction and activity. In this paper, we revisit the assumption of limited resources for enzyme induction (Sigma u(i) = 1) used in the cybernetic modeling framework by presenting a methodology for inferring the individual cybernetic variables u(i) from experimental data. We use this methodology to infer u(i) during the simultaneous consumption of glycerol and lactose by Escherichia coli and then model the fitness trade-offs involved in the recently discovered predictive regulation strategy of microorganisms.

Complexation Hydrogels as Oral Delivery Vehicles of Therapeutic Antibodies: An in Vitro and ex Vivo Evaluation of Antibody Stability and Bioactivity	INDUSTRIAL & ENGINEERING CHEMISTRY RESEARCH			English	Article							INSULIN DELIVERY; CONTROLLED-RELEASE; RESPONSIVE HYDROGELS; STABILIZATION; PROTEINS; SYSTEMS; NANOPARTICLES; ENCAPSULATION; CALCITONIN; DISEASES	Oral administration of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) may enable the localized treatment of infections or other conditions in the gastrointestinal tract (GI) as well as systemic diseases. As with the development of oral protein biotherapeutics, one of the most challenging tasks in antibody therapies is the loss of biological activity due to physical and chemical instabilities. New families of complexation hydrogels with pH-responsive properties have demonstrated to be excellent transmucosal delivery vehicles. This contribution focuses on the design and evaluation of hydrogel carriers that will minimize the degradation and, maximize the in vivo activity of anti-TNF-alpha, a mAb used for the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease (MD) in the GI tract and systemically for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. P(MAA-g-EG) and P(MAA-co-NVP) hydrogels systems were optimized to achieve adequate swelling behavior, which translated into improved protein loading and release at neutral pH simulating the small intestine conditions. Additionally, these hydrogel systems preserve antibody bioactivity upon release resulting in the systemic circulation of an antibody capable of effectively performing its biological function. The compatibility if these hydrogels for mAb bioactivity preservation and release makes them candidates for use as oral delivery systems for therapeutic antibodies.

Biodegradable, in Situ-Forming Cell-Laden Hydrogel Composites of Hydroxyapatite Nanoparticles for Bone Regeneration	INDUSTRIAL & ENGINEERING CHEMISTRY RESEARCH			English	Article							MESENCHYMAL STEM-CELLS; BIOMATERIALS	Hydroxyapatite nanoparticles (HANPs) were suspended in injectable, biodegradable, phosphate-containing, dual-gelling macromer solutions that were used to encapsulate mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) within stable hydrogel composites when elevated to physiologic temperature. The suspension of HANPs at 0.75%w/v within the hydrogels was found to have no significant effect on the swelling ratio or the compressive modulus. The MSCs were shown to survive the encapsulation process, and live cells were detected within the hydrogel composites for up to 28 days. The activity of osteogenic marker alkaline phosphatase increased with time in cell-laden hydrogel composites over the 28 days in osteogenic medium, suggesting that the joint combination of encapsulated MSCs within a HANP- and phosphate-containing hydrogel can enhance enzyme activity to assist in hydrogel mineralization. This is observed in the calcium biochemical assays, where the incorporation of HANPs significantly improved both cell-laden and acellular hydrogel composite mineralization over time. Hydrogel nanocomposites that form in situ while facilitating cell delivery and mineralization are promising materials for craniofacial bone tissue engineering.

Modeling of the denitrification process is challenging due to the complex metabolic regulation that modulates sequential formation and consumption of a series of nitrogen oxide intermediates, which serve as the final electron acceptors for denitrifying bacteria. In this work, we examined the effectiveness and accuracy of the cybernetic modeling framework in simulating the growth dynamics of denitrifying bacteria in comparison with kinetic models. In four different case studies using the literature data, we successfully simulated diauxic and triauxic growth patterns observed in anoxic and aerobic conditions, only by tuning two or three parameters. In order to understand the regulatory structure of the cybernetic model, we systematically analyzed the effect of cybernetic control variables on simulation accuracy. The results showed that the consideration of both enzyme synthesis and activity control through u- and v-variables is necessary and relevant and that u-variables are of greater importance in comparison to v-variables. In contrast, simple kinetic models were unable to accurately capture dynamic metabolic shifts across alternative electron acceptors, unless an inhibition term was additionally incorporated. Therefore, the denitrification process represents a reasonable example highlighting the criticality of considering dynamic regulation for successful metabolic modeling.

Through a case study of the growth of a recombinant Saccharomyces cerevisiae capable of excreting both a-amylase and glucoamylase on starch, we demonstrated that the interlinked population balance and cybernetic modeling framework developed previously, could be used to abstract and rationalize the response of the yeast in regulating these depolymerases. Our model, calibrated using the data from the literature (Ulgen et al., Process Biochem. 2002, 37, 1157-1168), showed that both a-amylase and glucoamylase are needed for efficient SSF. Specifically, by cleverly regulating the excretion of both depolymerases, yeast growth is relatively unaffected by different starches, a subtle point which could not have been elicited by existing methods.

Atom-Economical Selective-Ring-Opening Reaction of Glycidol with 1-Naphthol Catalyzed by Magnesium Silicate of a Biogenic Silica Source	INDUSTRIAL & ENGINEERING CHEMISTRY RESEARCH			English	Article							RICE HULL ASH; GLYCEROL CARBONATE; ACID	Ring-opening reaction is one of the most important processes in organic transformations wherein selectivity of the desired product is dependent on a number of parameters. Selective ring opening of glycidol with 1-naphthol was studied to make propanolol glycol [or 3-(1-naphthyloxy)propane-1,2-diol] over magnesium silicate as a heterogeneous catalyst. Propanolol glycol is used in the treatment of hypertension. Magnesium silicate catalyst was produced by combusting a biogenic silica source material such as rice hulls to give rich hull ash (RHA), and it was characterized by using several techniques such as X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, temperature-programmed desorption, and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller N-2 adsorption. The catalyst was highly active in ring-opening reaction, and 3-(1-naphthyloxy)propane-1,2-diol was the only product. The reaction was 100% atom selective. The effects of different kinetic parameters on the rate of ring opening of glycidol with 1-naphthol were studied systematically to establish the kinetics of the reaction. Magnesium silicate derived from RHA exhibited better catalytic behavior in the production of propanolol glycol with conversions of up to 80% in 3 h with 90% selectivity. The catalyst was characterized after the reaction and found to be robust without any loss of activity.

The flow regime transition was detected by the standard deviation of the pressure drop and visual observation, with further confirmation using a high-speed camera. Results show a significant effect of the prewetting procedure on the liquid superficial velocity at a fixed gas superficial velocity required for transition from trickle to bubbly flow and trickle to pulsing flow. At low gas superficial velocities, where the transition from trickle to bubbly flow occurs, a significant departure from literature model predictions is observed. Below VG = 20 mm/s, rather than the expected increase in the liquid superficial velocity required for transition with decreasing gas superficial velocity, the transition is observed to be essentially independent of the gas flow.

The model developed is accurate to first order in the transverse conduction time and is valid over a wider range of operating conditions and kinetics compared with the widely used traditional two-phase model. We provide a physical interpretation of the various effective transport coefficients appearing in the reduced-order model and show that it reduces to the commonly used two-phase model only in the limit of very slowly varying inlet conditions or very slow reactions. In the general transient reacting case, we show that the traditional heat transfer coefficient concept is not applicable because the solid fluid interfacial heat flux cannot be expressed in terms of the difference between any two phase-averaged temperatures even to leading order. We use the reduced-order model to examine the light-off behavior of the monolith and the speed and width of the temperature fronts as functions of various monolith parameters.

In this investigation, an all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulation has been carried out to describe the interaction of two, four, or six peptides placed on the surface of a 3:1 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DOPC)/1,2-di(9Z-octadecenoyl)-sn-glycero-3-phospho-(1'-rac-glycerol) (DOPG) lipid bilayer (a mimic of the bacterial cell membrane) corresponding to protein/lipid (P/L) ratios of 2:96, 4:162, or 6:166, respectively. MD simulation was also carried out for (i) one to eight transmembrane peptides (corresponding P/L ratios of 1:128 to 8:128) in a 3:1 DOPC/ DOPG mixed membrane for symmetric as well as asymmetric placement of peptides and (ii) four to eight transmembrane peptides (corresponding to P/L ratios of 4:128 to 8:128) for a pure DOPC lipid bilayer (a mimic of the mammalian cell membrane) for the asymmetric placement of peptides. The broadening of phospholipid head regions in the bottom leaflet as well as thinning of the membrane were found to occur for melittin placed on the top leaflet only for a mixed membrane. A critical P/L ratio of 6:166 was observed for the penetration of melittin from the surface, with this critical value being 6:128 for water channel formation in the case of transmembrane peptides. The phospholipid density profile across the bilayer indicated a toroidal pore structure. Asymmetric transmembrane pores were larger for the top leaflet and grew in size with time, whereas symmetric pores were stable. The behavior for mixed and pure membranes was found to be similar for transmembrane peptides, thus implying high toxicity of melittin.

Effect of Surface Hydrophobicity on the Function of the Immobilized Biomineralization Protein Mms6	INDUSTRIAL & ENGINEERING CHEMISTRY RESEARCH			English	Article							MULTIFUNCTIONAL MAGNETIC NANOPARTICLES; MAGNETOTACTIC BACTERIUM; BIOMEDICAL APPLICATIONS; MAGNETOSOME FORMATION; IRON-BINDING; GOLD; NANOCRYSTALS; FUNCTIONALIZATION; NANOSTRUCTURES; ADSORPTION	Magnetotactic bacteria produce magnetic nanocrystals with uniform shapes and sizes in nature, which has inspired in vitro synthesis of uniformly sized magnetite nanocrystals under mild conditions. Mms6, a biomineralization protein from magnetotactic bacteria with a hydrophobic N-terminal domain and a hydrophilic C-terminal domain, can promote formation of magnetite nanocrystals in vitro with well-defined shape and size in gels under mild conditions. Here we investigate the role of surface hydrophobicity on the ability of Mms6 to template magnetite nanoparticle formation on surfaces. Our results confirmed that Mms6 can form a protein network structure on a monolayer of hydrophobic octadecanethiol (ODT)-coated gold surfaces and facilitate magnetite nanocrystal formation with uniform sizes close to those seen in nature, in contrast to its behavior on more hydrophilic surfaces. We propose that this hydrophobicity effect might be due to the amphiphilic nature of the Mms6 protein and its tendency to incorporate the hydrophobic N-terminal domain into the hydrophobic lipid bilayer environment of the magnetosome membrane, exposing the hydrophilic C-terminal domain that promotes biomineralization. Supporting this hypothesis, the larger and well-formed magnetite nanoparticles were found to be preferentially located on ODT surfaces covered with Mms6 as compared to control samples, as characterized by scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and atomic force microscopy studies. A C-terminal domain mutant of this protein did not form the same network structure as wild-type Mms6, suggesting that the network structure is important for the magnetite nanocrystal formation. This study provides valuable insights into the role of surface hydrophilidty on the action of the biomineralization protein Mms6 to synthesize magnetic nanocrystals and provides a facile route to controlling bioinspired nanocrystal synthesis in vitro.

The synthesis reaction in the aqueous droplets of the water-in-oil miniemulsion is induced by mass transfer of the base triethylamine (TEA) across the liquid/liquid interface. In a preliminary study, the dosage of TEA was determined to ensure the required pH range in the aqueous phase. Miniemulsions with a mean droplet size of about 200 nm were produced with a rotor-stator device. The aqueous zinc salt concentration was varied as the parameter in the experimental study. At low zinc salt concentrations, platelike nanopartides were obtained. An increase in the zinc ion concentration resulted in a decrease in the mean particle size. The shape of the ZnO crystals changed from platelike to rodlike. On the basis of the resulting particle size, it can be deduced that interdroplet exchange is an essential part of the presented miniemulsion-based process.

Achieving Target Emulsion Drop Size Distributions Using Population Balance Equation Models of High-Pressure Homogenization	INDUSTRIAL & ENGINEERING CHEMISTRY RESEARCH			English	Article							TURBULENT-FLOW; EMULSIFICATION; PREDICTION; BREAKAGE; GROWTH	Population balance equation (PBE) models have been used extensively to predict drop size distributions (DSDs) of dispersed phase systems. In our previous publications, we have used the PBE framework to develop increasingly sophisticated process models for oil-in-water emulsification in high-pressure homogenizers. The goal of this study was to utilize these PBE models for integrated emulsion product and process design through the formulation and solution of homogenizer optimization problems. For a specified number of homogenization passes, the initial amount of surfactant and the pressure of each pass were determined by solving a nonlinear least-squares optimization problem such that the target DSD were achieved. Three alternative objective functions that differed with respect to the distribution specification and the penalty on surfactant usage were formulated and solved for different target DSDs. The model predictions were successfully validated by performing homogenization experiments using the optimized formulation and homogenization variables.

In this work, we outline the design of a fully implantable AP using intraperitoneal (IP) insulin delivery and glucose sensing. The design process utilizes the rapid glucose sensing and insulin action offered by the IP space to tune a PM controller with insulin feedback to provide safe and effective insulin delivery. The controller was tuned to meet robust performance and stability specifications. An anti-reset windup strategy was introduced to prevent dangerous undershoot toward hypoglycemia after a large meal disturbance. The final controller design achieved 78% of time within the tight glycemic range of 80-140 mg/dL, with no time spent in hypoglycemia. The next step is to test this controller design in an animal model to evaluate the in vivo performance.

For such plants, there is a potential of exhibiting multiple time scale material dynamics. An analysis framework is developed to identify the time scales where each process variable evolves and the potential manipulated inputs available in each time scale. A novel graph formalism is proposed to capture the material flow structure of such plants. Then, a graph-theoretic algorithm is developed, which mimics a singular perturbation-based time scale decomposition. The application of the proposed framework is illustrated using two example chemical plants.

Preliminary Evaluation of Shale Gas Reservoirs: Appraisal of Different Well-Pad Designs via Performance Metrics	INDUSTRIAL & ENGINEERING CHEMISTRY RESEARCH			English	Article							NATURALLY FRACTURED RESERVOIRS; WATER/OIL/GAS TRANSFER-FUNCTIONS; CYCLE WATER-CONSUMPTION; MARCELLUS SHALE; FINITE-ELEMENT; FLOW BEHAVIOR; NUMERICAL-SIMULATION; ENERGY RETURN; BARNETT SHALE; FLUID-FLOW	Shale gas production has been the focus of intense debate in recent years. Shale gas supporters claim that it could be the way to transition between fossil fuels and renewable energy sources. For instance, in the United States, power generation from coal is being replaced by power generation from natural gas, which is a cleaner fuel when compared to coal. However, shale gas critics claim that the environmental cost associated with shale gas production is high enough to negate the benefits to society. For example, high water usage as well as the potential for contamination of underground and surface water sources constitute important environmental challenges for the development of shale gas resources. This study presents a methodology for the preliminary assessment of the development of shale gas resources taking into account well-pad design as one of the most important decision variables. To perform the assessment, different performance metrics are proposed to evaluate not only the economics of developing a well-pad but also the environmental impact of its operation, including total gas production and water consumption. Finally, we illustrate through case studies that the selection of the well-pad design depends on the performance metric used.

Designing Robust Crystallization Processes in the Presence of Parameter Uncertainty Using Attainable Regions	INDUSTRIAL & ENGINEERING CHEMISTRY RESEARCH			English	Article							BATCH CRYSTALLIZATION; DYNAMIC EXPERIMENTS; CRYSTAL SIZE; OPTIMIZATION; NUCLEATION	We consider the influence of uncertainty in crystallization kinetics (i.e., in the nucleation and growth rates) in the context of process design. Specifically, we model continuous and batch crystallization processes using population balance equation models and investigate how the inherent uncertainty in kinetic parameters propagates through the crystallization processes and how it ultimately affects the distribution of process outcomes (yield and mean particle size). We incorporate the effect of uncertainty into the concept of attainable regions, i.e., we exhaustively investigate which combinations of particle size and total residence time (or batch time) can be attained with a certain probability. Avoiding regions of low probability allows the design of robust crystallization processes that can deliver a product with desired specifications, even when the original process was designed using inadequately characterized crystallization kinetics. The concepts presented in this article are illustrated by a case study on the cooling crystallization of paracetamol grown from ethanol as a solvent.

Modeling Hysteresis during Crystallization and Dissolution: Application to a Paracetamol-Ethanol System	INDUSTRIAL & ENGINEERING CHEMISTRY RESEARCH			English	Article							POPULATION BALANCE-EQUATIONS; COOLING CRYSTALLIZATION; SOLUBILITY; FBRM; OPTIMIZATION; SHAPE	Crystallization and dissolution processes are of great scientific and commercial interest. Significant efforts have been made in the past to develop mathematical models to describe these processes. In this work, observed hysteresis in particle counts during the crystallization and dissolution processes was used to develop and to test the mathematical models of crystallization and dissolution. Crystallization and dissolution experiments were performed with a system of paracetamol and ethanol. An undersaturated solution was first cooled at a particular rate causing crystallization and crystal growth. The solution was then reheated at the same rate to completely dissolve the generated particles. The particle counts and particle size distribution were measured online using a focus beam reflectance measurement (FBRM) probe. A hysteresis was observed in particle counts with respect to the solution temperature. It was also observed that this hysteresis was affected by the applied heating/cooling rates (0.3, 0.5, and 0.7 K/min) for of the solution. A systematic modeling framework based on the population balance equation (PBE) is developed for quantitatively capturing this hysteresis and the influence of cooling/heating rate on the hysteresis curve. A two-level approach was developed to simulate hysteresis: (a) PBE was solved using computationally efficient method of moments for the crystallization stage. This step was used to efficiently estimate values of parameters appearing in the model equations. (b) PBEs describing crystallization and dissolution were then solved using high resolution finite volume (HRFV) scheme coupled with the moving pivot method. The simulated hysteresis curve showed good agreement with the experimental data. Though simulated results over predicted the average particle (by,similar to 131%), the models were successful in qualitatively explaining the counterintuitive trends observed as the average particle size was tracked with time. The framework was thus shown to be a reliable and robust framework to model crystallization and dissolution processes. The developed approach, models, and results will be useful for simulating industrially relevant crystallization dissolution processes.

It is shown that conditions leading to appreciable homogeneous particle nucleation in this "expanded supersaturated liquid" environment can be sufficiently short-lived that they preclude appreciable particle growth because of encounters with solute molecules or other precipitate particles. This leads to relatively narrow predicted precipitated particle size distributions (PSDs), with a characteristic particle size determined by the typical critical nucleation size. Our mathematical techniques, which exploit the method of characteristics (MOC), make no presumption about PSD-shape and our numerical simulations employ realistic thermophysical properties for the previously studied model system: phenanthrene (surrogate "active pharmaceutical ingredient" [solute], toluene [solvent, S], and compressed CO, [AS]). We explicitly consider initial solvent droplet diameters in the micrometer range and CO, pressures of 52-64 bar and demonstrate the necessity of relaxing frequently made approximations (e.g., nucleation with constant surface energy, negligible Gibbs-Kelvin-Ostwald solubility corrections, solute diluteness,...). Our new methods/parametrizations/performance results for this mathematical model should already help select optimal GASP/SASP operating conditions, and, with suitable extensions, ultimately lead to the development of nearly equally tractable yet sufficiently complete process models.

Solutions of IL-ethanol having different IL contents were used to prepare 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium dicyanamide abmim][DCA]) membranes having different thicknesses. Membranes prepared from 25 wt % IL in ethanol solution showed the best gas permeation and separation performance. Ionic liquid membranes prepared from 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide aemim][Tf2N]) under the same conditions displayed a slightly higher gas permeance, but its separation capability was somewhat lower. Tests at higher temperatures using the [bmim] [DCA] membrane generated obviously higher gas permeances, but the ideal separation factors of CO2 over N-2 and He dropped sharply. These tests were carried out with a dry feed gas. Adding polyamidoamine (PAMAM) dendrimer generation 0 to IL did not show any improvement when the feed gas was dry. After the feed gas was humidified, both the permeance and the separation factor of CO2 over N-2 and He were improved greatly. This is due to lower viscosity caused by dissolved water in the IL membrane and additional reactions between CO2 and tertiary amine units of dendrimer in the presence of water. A set of gas mixture-based test results confirmed the facilitating effects of dendrimer to enhance CO2 permeation with humidified feed gas.

The design method was verified using computer simulations for two systems. The adsorption isotherms of fructose/glucose and p-xylene/toluene systems have weak and strong temperature dependence, respectively. The results show that nonlinear thermal SMB systems can simultaneously produce pure solvent as well as concentrated, high-purity products from dilute feeds. The condition that allows for production of pure solvent is determined from local equilibrium analysis. Optimization of ten decision variables to achieve minimum solvent consumption and maximum productivity takes less than 5 min using a laptop computer. The fructose/glucose thermal SMB system products are increased by >25% with solvent consumption decreased 2-fold. The p-xylene/toluene thermal SMB system product concentrations can be increased 10-fold while simultaneously producing pure solvents.	[Soepriatna, Nicholas; Wang, N. H.

Assessing Performance of Irregular Microvoids in Electrophoresis Separations	INDUSTRIAL & ENGINEERING CHEMISTRY RESEARCH			English	Article							DIVERGING MICROCHANNELS; GEL-ELECTROPHORESIS; TRANSPORT; MORPHOLOGY; MEMBRANES; FIELDS; FLOWS	Within the past decade, novel gel materials with a modified internal morphology have been synthesized and are available for a wide range of applications including drug delivery and separation of biomolecules with relevance in clinical diagnostics, electroldnetic pumping, and sensors.(1-3) One way to achieve this internal modification is to embed nanoparticles into the polymer matrix so that when an electrical field is applied to the system, the presence of these particles can change the biomacromolecule transport through the gel, possibly altering the separation.(4) As a result, gaining a very deep understanding of the role that these nanoparticles can have in the separation efficiency in terms of electrophoresis techniques becomes very important. To the best of our knowledge, this contribution is the first effort that examines the role of morphology (in the form of an axially diverging microdomain) on the prediction of optimal separation times for two protein models when they are subjected to electrophoresis. The research conducted predicts that the optimal separation time of a short, straight pore yields the best resolution in this type of electrophoretic separation.

Isotherms for Water Adsorption on Molecular Sieve 3A: Influence of Cation Composition	INDUSTRIAL & ENGINEERING CHEMISTRY RESEARCH			English	Article							SILICA-GEL; ZEOLITE-A; REMOVAL; VAPOR	This work is part of our continuing efforts to address engineering issues related to the removal of tritiated water from off-gases produced in used nuclear fuel reprocessing facilities. In the current study, adsorption equilibrium of water on molecular sieve 3A beads was investigated. Adsorption isotherms for water on the UOP molecular sieve 3A were measured by a continuous-flow adsorption system at 298, 313, 333, and 353 K. Experimental data collected were analyzed by the Generalized Statistical Thermodynamic Adsorption (GSTA) isotherm model. The K+/Na+ molar ratio of this particular type of molecular sieve 3A was similar to 4:6. Our results showed that the GSTA isotherm model worked very well to describe the equilibrium behavior of water adsorption on molecular sieve 3A. The optimum number of parameters for the current experimental data was determined to be a set of four equilibrium parameters. This result suggests that the adsorbent crystals contain four energetically distinct adsorption sites. In addition, it was found that water adsorption on molecular sieve 3A follows a three-stage adsorption process. This three-stage adsorption process confirmed different water adsorption sites in molecular sieve crystals. The second adsorption stage is significantly affected by the K+/Na+ molar ratio. In this stage, the equilibrium adsorption capacity at a given water vapor pressure increases as the K+/Na+ molar ratio increases.

Here, we study a new and more general approach to column consolidation, of which the conventional approach is a special case. In the new approach, the reboiler of a column is coupled with the condenser of another, through heat and mass integration in an additional section (HMA-section). The introduction of an HMA-section eliminates multiple connecting streams/valves, reduces the number of reboilers, condensers, and distillation columns by one each, and reduces the heat duty of the configuration. We exhaustively enumerate HMA-sections, and lay out a framework to identify all configurations with HMA-sections. Through examples, we show that both heat integration and mass integration resulting from introducing an HMA-section contribute to reduce the heat duty significantly.

On Mixing and Segregation: From Fluids and Maps to Granular Solids and Advection-Diffusion Systems	INDUSTRIAL & ENGINEERING CHEMISTRY RESEARCH			English	Article							PARTICLE-SIZE SEGREGATION; FLOWS	In fluids, diffusive transport and fluid parameters are determined by the thermally driven movement of molecules, whereas in granular media, thermal effects play no role in transport. Despite this fundamental difference, mixing in fluids and mixing and segregation in granular solids share many similarities. The advection diffusion equation formalism unites the two systems and can be used in both cases to predict and understand how and when mixing occurs, through the use of strategic simplifications. We illustrate this connection with a fluid mixing example (the rotated potential mixer) and a granular segregation example (the segregation of a bidisperse mixture flowing in a chute).

Low-Dimensional Modeling of Transport and Reactions in Two-Phase Stratified Flow	INDUSTRIAL & ENGINEERING CHEMISTRY RESEARCH			English	Article							LIQUID-LIQUID-EXTRACTION; DESCRIBING DISPERSION; LAMINAR-FLOW; METAL-IONS; MICROCHANNEL; PERFORMANCE; SYSTEM; PHASE	In this work, we develop low-dimensional models to describe steady-state mass transfer and reactions in two-phase stratified flow in microchannels. The partial differential equations that consider the effect of axial convection, transverse diffusion, and reaction are averaged in the transverse direction using the Lyapunov Schmidt method. The resulting reduced-order model describes the evolution of the cup-miming average and cross-section average concentrations along the axial direction. Two different reduced models are obtained: a One-Equation-Averaged (OEA) model, in which we average across both fluids simultaneously, and a Two-Equation-Averaged (TEA) model, in which we average across each fluid separately by embedding in a family of cognate problems. The OEA model cannot capture the initial mass transfer between the phases when they first come into contact at the inlet of the channel. It can only be used when there is a deviation from equilibrium due to a reaction. The TEA model overcomes these limitations and is able to describe mass transfer between the phases right from the inlet of the channel. It accurately predicts extraction and reactive extraction with slow reactions. However, if the reaction is fast, the TEA model fails and the OEA model is preferable. Some applications of the TEA model are presented. It leads to closed-form expressions for the overall mass-transfer coefficient, in terms of the properties of the fluids and their holdups. An analytical solution of the TEA model is derived for the case of nonreactive extraction and is used to identify the operating conditions for high extraction performance. Finally, the TEA model is applied to investigate how the yield in competitive-consecutive reactions can be improved by exploiting the mass-transfer resistance between the two phases.

J	Kim, S				Kim, Sangtae			Ellipsoidal Microhydrodynamics without Elliptic Integrals and How To Get There Using Linear Operator Theory	INDUSTRIAL & ENGINEERING CHEMISTRY RESEARCH			English	Article								In this special dedication paper for the Doraiswami Ramkrishna Festschrift, several remarkably simple results in viscous fluid mechanics (also known as microhydrodynamics) are examined in the context of linear operator theory and the properties of self-adjoint operators. In particular, we highlight, for the broader chemical engineering community, that for a small sphere undergoing rigid body motion (REM) in Stokes flow the surface tractions are simply a multiplicative constant times that same REM and that this amazing and simple result is the consequence of linear operator theory applied to the relevant self-adjoint operator. Thus, to provide an illustrative example of the general theory that this can be true only for the sphere, we reexamine the corresponding classical (1876 and 1964) results for the surface tractions on an ellipsoid. The ellipsoid not only provides the example as expected, but produces a useful result that in the so-called mobility problem where the force and torque on the ellipsoid are the known inputs, the surface tractions can be cast in a very simple form that is independent of elliptic integrals and other complexities usually associated with ellipsoidal geometries. This connection between linear operators and transport phenomena highlights the power of mathematics in unifying the pedagogical framework for chemical engineers and the great influence of Professor Ramkrishna over the past half-century.

Particles of this size can be easily separated from the exit streams to avoid downstream processing-related issues. The results show that the presence of hydrophilic particles in small quantities (volume fraction range of 2 X 10(-4) to 1.25 x 10(-2)) significantly decreases the dispersed phase fraction at which water-in-oil (w/o) dispersions invert but leaves the inversion of oil-in-water (o/w) dispersions nearly unaffected. The addition of the same particles after they are hydrophobized decreases the dispersed phase fraction at which o/w dispersions invert but leaves the inversion of w/o dispersions unaffected. These findings suggest an increased rate of coalescence of drops when particles wet drops preferentially and a marginal decrease when they wet the continuous phase preferentially. High-speed conductivity measurements on w/o dispersion show transient conduction of a few hundred milliseconds duration through voltage pulses. Close to the inversion point, voltage pulses appear at high frequency for even 7 cm separation between the electrodes. The presence of hydrophilic particles produces a nearly identical signal at a significantly lower dispersed phase fraction itself, close to the new lowered inversion point in the presence of particles. We propose formation of elongated domains of the conducting dispersed phase through a rapid coalescence-deformation-breakup process to explain the new observations. The voltage signal appears as a forerunner of inversion instability.

A quantitative comparison of the one-dimensional (ID), 2D, and 3D models has been conducted to determine the range of applicability of these models in terms of prediction of the stable behavior of crystallizers. Both dynamic and steady-state models have been solved for two crystals of practical importance:,64,glutamic acid and hydroquinone, whose nucleation and growth models are well-known. It has been shown that the ID and 2D models agree in terms of stability if the exact shape factor is supplied to the 1D model. If the shape factor is taken to be unity, inaccurate results are produced by the ID model. The shape factor must be known within 20% of its true value for reasonably accurate results from the ID model with respect to stability. The 3D model does not offer any additional advantage in this regard unless the growth rates in the second and third dimensions differ more than 30%.

Strategy for Obtaining Bimodal Bubble Size Distribution in Water Blown Polyurethane Foams	INDUSTRIAL & ENGINEERING CHEMISTRY RESEARCH			English	Article							DYNAMICS	Polyurethane foams with multimodal cell distribution exhibit superior mechanical and thermal properties. A technique for generating bimodal bubble size distribution exists in the literature, but it uses supercritical conditions. In the present work, an alternative based on milder operating conditions is proposed. It is a modification of reaction injection molding (RIM), using reactants already seeded with bubbles. The number density of the seeds determines if two nucleating events can occur. A bimodal bubble size distribution is obtained when this happens A mathematical model is used to test this hypothesis by simulating water blown free rise polyurethane foams. The effects of initial concentration of bubbles, temperature of the reactants, and the weight fraction of water are studied. The study reveals that for certain concentrations of initial number of bubbles, when initial temperature and weight fraction of water are high, it is possible to obtain a second nucleation event, leading to bimodal bubble size distribution.

Aggregation kernel is a difficult kernel to predict from first principle because of its nonlinear nature. In this work we demonstrate a new methodology to obtain the aggregation kernel through inverse problem approach. This new approach is based on the method of weighted residuals and does not rely on specific traits of the system like self-similarity. The residual approach reduces the inverse problem into solution of a set of linear equations. However, the system of equations is badly conditioned and therefore requires regularization for accurate solution. In this work Tikhonov regularization technique has been used. The new method has been demonstrated successfully for constant, sum, and product kernel.

J	Kim, S				Kim, Sangtae			Ellipsoidal Microhydrodynamics without Elliptic Integrals and How To Get There Using Linear Operator Theory: A Note on Weighted Inner Products	INDUSTRIAL & ENGINEERING CHEMISTRY RESEARCH			English	Article								In this research note we revisit the topic of microhydrodynamics of an ellipsoid in rigid body motion to arrive at the final resolution of a 140-year-old "mystery" that was featured in the dedication paper on the same topic in the Doraiswami Ramkrishna Festschrift. There, the initial focus was on the role of the theory of self-adjoint operators as the framework for proving that the surface tractions on a sphere had to be a constant multiple of the same rigid body motions of the boundary conditions. The ellipsoid was then considered as a simple example to illustrate the loss of this behavior for nonspherical particles. That goal was accomplished because for an ellipsoid, n center dot x, the dot product of the surface normal n and the point x on the ellipsoid surface, is the required nonconstant multiplier. The simplicity of this result is striking and has been noticed throughout its history with a number of authors remarking on the lengthy algebraic manipulations required to prove this simple result. In keeping with the theme of the Doraiswami Ramkrishna Festschrift, this note presents a short and simple proof that highlights the importance of the choice of the inner product, that is, the definition of the metric. The introduction of n center dot x = w(x) as a so-called weight function in the definition of the weighted inner product, as in < f, g >(w) = integral f(s)g(s)w(s)ds over the appropriate metric space transforms the double layer operator (DLO) into a self-adjoint operator. From this it follows that the eigenfunctions of the adjoint with respect to the nonweighted inner product are w times the DLO eigenfunctions. Thus, the simplification noted in the companion paper is true for all eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the double layer operator and not just the eigenvalue of 1 and its associated eigenfunction v(RBm). These insights open the door to significant opportunities in the computational analysis of ellipsoidal particles in nanoparticle technology including topics such as perturbation methods for inertial and non-Newtonian effects, as we now have ready access to the spectral decomposition and biorthogonal expansions for the double layer operator.

The mechanisms of glycoside hydrolases that both invert and retain the configuration of the anomeric carbon atom of the labile glycosidic bond are covered, as is the twisting of the glycosidic bond exerted by members of different glycoside hydrolase families. The hydrolytic mechanisms and substrate binding of five different carboxylic ester hydrolase classes-acetylcholinesterases, butyrylcholinesterases, cocaine esterases, carboxylesterases, and triacylglycerol lipases-are addressed. Finally, the mechanism of members of a thioesterase family with HotDog tertiary structures is covered.

A nongassing test cell was built with a ceramic membrane sandwiched between two identical electrodes comprising CeO2-x, nanoparticle-decorated, nitrogen-containing graphene oxide sheets. We demonstrated the switching between the three possible flow and current regimes as reactants were exhausted in the redox active CeO2-x, and the nitrogen-containing graphene electrodes.

Different strategies have been developed to colocalize enzymes on nanocarriers to improve multienzyme catalytic efficiency by mimicking MEC structure and function. Numerous studies have indicated that the spatial arrangement and orientation of multiple enzymes in confined spaces are critical in facilitating cooperative enzymatic activity in multienzyme colocalization. Biomolecule scaffolds based on DNA hybridization have attracted great attention because of their unique effective control of the relative positions of different enzymes in multienzyme colocalization. To demonstrate this concept, glucose oxidase (GOX) and horseradish peroxidase (HRP) were colocalized onto polystyrene nanopartides via specific DNA hybridization. Colocalization of GOX and HRP was evidenced by Forster resonance energy transfer studies of the dyes labeling the two tag DNAs. Finally, it was observed that colocalization of GOX and HRP via DNA hybridization significantly improved both the overall reaction efficiency and the storage shelf life compared with those of the single enzyme immobilization mixture control. In summary, DNA-directed colocalization of multiple enzymes on nanoparticles is an effective way to control the relative positioning of enzymes to mimic MECs and enhance catalytic activity.

On Thermodynamic Consistency of a Stochastic Constitutive Model for Glassy Polymers	INDUSTRIAL & ENGINEERING CHEMISTRY RESEARCH			English	Article							FLUCTUATION-DISSIPATION THEOREM; SYSTEMS; MEMORY	A full understanding of the thermomechanical behavior of materials in the glassy state remains one of the outstanding challenges in condensed matter physics. A recently developed stochastic constitutive model (SCM) that explicitly acknowledges nanoscale dynamic heterogeneity has had success in describing a number of nonlinear mechanical and relaxation experiments. The model employs stochastic differential equations to describe evolution of the local thermodynamic variables of entropy and the stress tensor, where the magnitude of the fluctuations is itself a strong nonlinear function of these variables. Notwithstanding the successes of the model, there is a legitimate question whether the formulation is thermodynamically consistent because, unlike the SCM, the stochastic systems treated in the literature satisfy the fluctuation dissipation theorem and assume constant magnitude of fluctuations. We propose expression for the free energy that results in fulfilment of the H-theorem statement and develop the second law in the Clausius Duhem form for the SCM, where the expression for the power of the external driving forces is modified in the stochastic case as compared to that in standard continuum mechanics.

Generic Framework for Crystallization Processes Using the Population Balance Model and Its Applicability	INDUSTRIAL & ENGINEERING CHEMISTRY RESEARCH			English	Article							CRYSTAL-GROWTH; EQUATIONS; SHAPE; SIZE	A generic modeling framework for batch cooling crystallization processes has been developed to understand the crystallization process from operational and modeling point of view. The generic framework for crystallization process modeling incorporates the characteristic dimensions of crystals and polymorphic transformation, as well as the hydrodynamic mixing effects in the crystallizer. This Polyhedral Polymorphic Multizonal Population Balance (PPMPBM) model considers bottom-up and top-down approaches for specific systems with specific targets. The PPMPBM framework allows switching between complex and simple models to study different crystallization systems with different scenarios and combination thereof. This framework uses gPROMS software (PSE, UK) and the Microsoft Excel front-end, along with the Polytope module in Matlab, to predict the crystal size and shape evolution as well as supersaturation profiles inside the crystallizer, which can be implemented for various crystallization systems.

The comparison experiments in different systems showed that the combination of Na2S2O8 and H2O2 had significant synergistic effects on the rate of NO absorption. The effects of Na2S2O8 concentration, H2O2 concentration, NO concentration, pH, O-2 concentration, and gas flow rate on the rate of NO absorption were investigated. The rate of NO absorption increased with the increase in Na2S2O8 concentration, H2O2 concentration, and gas flow rate. The rate of NO absorption increased slightly with the increase in 02 concentration, whereas it increased linearly with the increase in NO concentration. At pH 11, the rate of NO absorption reached 1.31 X 10(-6) mol/m(2).s. The NO absorption by dual oxidants (H2O2/S2O82-) was pseudo-first-order with respect to the NO concentration. Moreover, a simple rate equation of NO absorption by H2O2/S2O82- was obtained. The results of the rate equation indicate that the calculated values are consistent with the experimental values.

The structures, morphology, and photocatalytic properties of the samples were characterized by X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, and UV-vis absorption spectrometry. The photocatalytic activities of these BiOCl/BiOBr composites were evaluated by their ability in degradation of Rhodamine B under visible-light irradiation. Results reveal that the MWAC-synthesized 1:5 BiOCl/BiOBr composite is much more active than that synthesized by the hydrothermal method. The former composite obviously maintains high photocatalytic activity after five cycles and thus is the best one among all these photocatalysts. The visible-light photocatalytic activity enhancement of BiOCl/BiOBr composites could be attributed to their strong absorption in the visible region and the low recombination rate of electron hole pairs. Among different scavengers, the main active species during the photocatalytic process are h(+) and center dot O2-. The possible photocatalytic mechanism was proposed based on the experimental results.

The developed model is based on experimental data presented in the literature. For the current case the reaction process formulation of the shrinking particle model in the usual integrated form is challenging, and the model is therefore given as differential equations that are solved numerically. A surface passivation model was implemented to explain experimentally observed surface passivation. The kinetic model includes multiple experimental parameters, which were estimated by comparison with experimental data. The reliability of the estimated parameters and model predictions was studied using novel Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods. The MCMC analysis indicated that all model parameters were well identified without any cross correlation. The results also show that pyrite surface reactions with both molecular oxygen and ferric iron are important at the studied experimental conditions, and their relative importance depends on the pyrite slurry concentration.

Diffusion and Tortuosity in Porous Functionalized Calcium Carbonate	INDUSTRIAL & ENGINEERING CHEMISTRY RESEARCH			English	Article							ZLC DESORPTION CURVES; LENGTH; EQUILIBRIUM; SILICALITE; ADSORPTION; RELEASE	Calcium carbonate can be "functionalized" by use of etching agents such as phosphoric acid to create inter- and intraparticle porosity with a range of morphologies. Functionalized calcium carbonate has potential for use as a carrier for the delayed release of actives, such as drugs, plant protection chemicals, and food additives such as flavors. The drug or flavor is released slowly by permeation and diffusion. In order to measure the effective rate of diffusion within a range of morphologies, and hence gain insights into the optimum mode of functionalization, the diffusion of vanillin in ethanol is reported. Effective diffusion coefficients D' were measured in a flow cell connected to a high performance liquid chromatograph (HPLC). Samples were also subjected to mercury intrusion porosimetry. The resulting percolation characteristics were inverse modeled using the PoreXpert package to generate representative void structures with estimated tortuosities. It is shown that the primary particle size of a sample was a better predictor of D' calculated from the experimental diffusion curves, and also of the porosity-scaled tortuosity values, than the porosity or surface area. There was also a correlation between intraparticle tortuosity, scaled by porosity, and diffusion coefficient. The approach is validated by experimental evidence from this and related studies.

It reveals that the carbonization temperature plays a crucial role in determining the pore structures as well as their electrochemical performances. Increasing the carbonization temperature from 800 to 1200 degrees C, the corresponding porosity has slightly decreased, accompanied by an increase of graphitization degree. Next, to further improve the electrochemical performance of the sample prepared at 800 degrees C, a novel redox additive of 4-(4-nitrophenylazo)-1-naphthol (NPN) with different amounts has been introduced in 2 mol L-1\ KOH electrolyte. Therein, the specific capacitance by adding 4 mmol L-1 of NPN can reach 2.98 times higher than the pristine value. Apparently, the mixed electrolytes have largely enhanced the electrochemical performance, which is expected to be applied in the field of high performance supercapacitors.

F.; Goncalves, Flavia R.; de Vicente, Juan			Magnetorheology of Carbonyl Iron Dispersions in 1-Alkyl-3methylimidazolium Ionic Liquids	INDUSTRIAL & ENGINEERING CHEMISTRY RESEARCH			English	Article							ELECTROACOUSTICS; SUSPENSIONS; FLUIDS	In this work, a range of ionic liquids (IL), all based on 1-alkyl-3-methylimidazolium, [EMIM], and [BMIM] cations, with different anions, [NTf2](-), [CF3SO3](-), [SCI](-), [BF4](-), [PF6](-), and [CH3COO](-), were used as carrier fluids to prepare magnetorheological (MR) fluids with 30 vol % carbonyl iron powder (CIP), grade EW (BASF SE), without additives. ILMR fluids were characterized in the presence of magnetic fields with conventional steady shear stress ramps, constant shear rate magnetosweeps, and strain amplitude oscillatory shear tests. In the absence of magnetic fields, samples were subjected to temperature sweep (from +80 to 20 degrees C), settling, and redispersibility tests. We conclude that, under large enough magnetic field strengths, above 10 kA/m, there is not a significant effect of the IL employed, in terms of MR effect or MR performance, both in steady shear as well as oscillatory shear. On the other hand, for long shelf life, without applied magnetic field at rest, [EMIM]ICF,SO3](-), [BMIKISCNI-, and [BMIM][CH3COO](-) are not good candidates as carrier fluids for MR fluids, since they are very difficult to redisperse because of existing specific chemical interactions with the particle surface. In terms of settling stability, [BMIM][PF6] and [BMIN]ICH3COO](-) presented slower settling rates, because of their higher viscosities; however, the sedimentation curves collapse when normalized by the viscosity of the IL. Overall, the presence of fluorinated anions, such as [NTf2](-), [BF4](-), and [PF6](-) facilitates redispersibility, as demonstrated by penetration tests.	[Bombard, Antonio J.

Efficient Decomposition Approach for Large-Scale Refinery Scheduling	INDUSTRIAL & ENGINEERING CHEMISTRY RESEARCH			English	Article							CONTINUOUS-TIME FORMULATION; CRUDE-OIL OPERATIONS; SUBSTANTIAL DOWNSTREAM BENEFITS; GASOLINE BLENDING OPERATIONS; MULTIMILLION-DOLLAR BENEFITS; LINEAR-PROGRAMMING MODEL; MIXED-INTEGER; RECIPE DETERMINATION; OPTIMIZATION; BLENDSHOP	This paper proposes a heuristic algorithm for integrated scheduling of refinery production unit operations and finished product blending and delivery operations. To apply the proposed iterative algorithm, the integrated oil-refinery scheduling problem is decomposed into a production unit scheduling problem and a finished product blending and delivery scheduling problem. The goal of the algorithm is to obtain a feasible solution that satisfies product demand commitments with minimum demurrage violations while minimizing run-mode changeover cost, inventory cost, and penalties subject to product and logistics giveaways. The proposed algorithm provides a feasible solution at the end of each iteration, and to obtain solution without demurrage violations, a set of integer cuts are generated at the end of an iteration to eliminate current task assignment sequence for a multipurpose blend unit. The applicability of the algorithm is illustrated by a realistic large-scale refinery case study producing diesel and jet fuel. Significant savings are realized in the computational effort.

Comparison of specific work published in the literature is not straightforward due to the variety of compression configurations and the design bases. Therefore, four configurations (two-, three-, and four-stage and pump-added three-stage compressions) along with three natural gas compositions were considered. To compare with the simulation and optimization results in the literature, these 12 cases, having the same design basis, were optimized by adjusting the optimization variables such as the flow rate and composition of the refrigerant, the compression ratio of each compressor, the inlet pressure of the first compressor, and the outlet temperatures of the hot and cold refrigerant streams. There were two important findings: (1) adding a pump reduces specific work more than adding a compressor or decreasing the minimum temperature difference value in the compressors; (2) among the four configurations, the refrigerant composition does not significantly change, although it greatly affects the efficiency. The former results from the compressor constraint of the gaseous inlet and the latter from the minimum temperature constraint of the multistream heat exchanger. Furthermore, direct comparisons to other studies were also performed showing the importance of optimization and the effect of the design basis.

We use the matrix pencil to evaluate directly the stability of index-2 differential algebraic equations and formulate stability constraints using the Routh-Hurwitz test. The underlying mathematical problem is difficult to solve because it involves infinite stability constraints. We developed an algorithm where an infinite number of constraints can be implemented as several relaxation problems that are solved iteratively. Additionally, the simulation result under parametric uncertainty is used to estimate the bound of the state perturbations rather than assumptions based on experience that may lead to overly conservative or not implementable designs. To illustrate the method, we apply it to a reactor-separator-recycle process and obtain the robustly stable design.

This paper presents a new approach for the algorithmic procedure Water Sources Diagram (WSD), which is developed to be applied in large multiple contaminants water allocation problems (WAPs). In the WSD procedure, the reference contaminant definition is a key step and often leads to cumbersome calculations in following steps to get the final network from an intermediate structure, which is obtained based on the reference contaminant. The proposed new approach reduces the importance of the reference contaminant choice, simplifying the following calculations by adopting a decomposition strategy. It is applied in two large process plant examples, and the results show a good performance of the new approach.	[Calixto, Ewerton E.

Because the design of even a single distillation column model results in a nonconvex large-scale and mixed-integer optimization problem, if rigorous thermodynamic models are applied, deterministic optimization is still mostly limited to local optimization. In order to investigate and improve the solution quality of previously developed efficient local optimization approaches, this paper proposes a hybrid evolutionary deterministic optimization approach. The resulting memetic algorithm not only allows the optimization of the initial process structure but also facilitates discrete decision making that severely complicates a deterministic optimization due to the resulting discontinuities. The proposed approach not only eases the application by reducing the necessary user input for the initialization but also strengthens the confidence in the quality of the results because it provides an extensive screening of the design space. Several case studies, including utility and entrainer selection, demonstrate the performance of the hybrid optimization approach and suggest that even more complex design problems can be solved efficiently.

J	Yu, BY; Chien, IL				Yu, Bor-Yih; Chien, I-Lung			Design and Economic Evaluation of a Coal-Based Polygeneration Process To Coproduce Synthetic Natural Gas and Ammonia	INDUSTRIAL & ENGINEERING CHEMISTRY RESEARCH			English	Article							SHIFT REACTION-KINETICS; PLANTWIDE CONTROL; CO2 CAPTURE; POWER; GASIFICATION; SIMULATION; SYSTEM; PERFORMANCE; PART	The steady-state design and economic evaluation of a polygeneration (POLYGEN) process to coproduce synthetic natural gas (SNG) and ammonia are studied in this work. POLYGEN has been a widely studied topic recently, in which several products could be produced parallel at the same time. One of the two products in this study, SNG, has a composition and heat value very similar to those of typical natural gas, and can be used as a replacement in industrial and home usages. Another product, ammonia, is one of the most important inorganic chemicals in the world, and could be used as the precursor of various kinds of chemicals, as fertilizers, or as a cleaning agent. In the POLYGEN process, the relative production rates for different chemicals could be adjusted on the basis of different market demands, daily usages, and also changing political strategies. In our previous study (Yu, B. Y.; Chien, I. L. Design and Economical Evaluation of a Coal-to-Synthetic Natural Gas Process. Ind. Eng. Chem. Res. 2015, 54, 2339-2352), we illustrated that the SNG production price is lower than the liquefied natural gas importation price in Taiwan. The SNG production price is 10.837 USD/GJ (USD = U.S. dollars) in an SNG-only plant. With the POLYGEN process to coproduce SNG and ammonia, the SNG production cost could become even lower. If 20% of the syngas is used to produce ammonia, the SNG production price will drop to 9.365 USD/GJ, and if 40% is used for ammonia production, the SNG production price will drop further to 7.063 USD/GJ. Thus, although the POLYGEN process leads to an increasing total capital investment, it has positive influences from economic aspects. Besides, the flexibility of shifting the production rate of SNG or ammonia makes it possible to adapt to changes in the market demand.

To tackle these 2D dynamics, many control algorithms have been proposed by combining iterative learning control (TLC) with high-performance continuous control algorithms under a 2D framework. However, these algorithms require large computational load and memory, which are often demanding for the software and hardware of the controllers in several fast batch processes. In this paper, a 2D predictive functional control algorithm that combines ILC with predictive functional control (PFC) is proposed. Owing to the compactness and effectiveness of PFC, the proposed control algorithm can reduce the required computational load and memory. Other than the general form of the control law, two concise and practical forms are provided as well. The proposed control scheme is tested through simulations and implementation in an injection molding process, which is a typical fast batch process. Results confirm the good performance of the proposed control algorithm.

A recently developed PR+COSMOSAC equation of state (EOS) with its molecular interaction parameters determined from quantum mechanical calculations has been shown to provide reasonable prediction accuracy for vapor pressure of almost any chemical species without the issue of missing parameters. In this work, we introduce two modifications to improve the accruacty of its prediction of the vapor pressure. The overall deviation in pressure for 1124 pure liquids from the modified version is 138%, which is about 1/4 of that of the original model (553%). In particular, the accuracy for the vapor pressure near the triple point shows major improvement, with the average error reduced from 1062% to 233%. The sublimation pressure can also be estimated, provided that the melting temperature and enthalpy of fusion are available. The average deviation in sublimation pressure from the modified PR+COSMOSAC EOS for 1140 substances is 412%, which is only 1/3 that of the original model (1249%). This model is capable of providing both the vapor pressure and sublimation pressure over a wide range of conditions (from the critical point to below the triple point). It is particularly useful when experimental data are not available.

A global reaction rate was calculated from the intrinsic kinetic rate with the effectiveness factor, and the calculated value is fitted well with the experimental data, which indicates that the global reaction rate is reliable. Further, a scale-up HCl oxidation experiment has been carried out in a single-tube reactor with an inner diameter of 22 mm using shaped CeO2 CuO/Y as the catalyst. A one-dimensional fixed-bed model based on the global reaction rate was adopted to properly describe the reaction behavior in the single-tube reactor.

The main contribution is to extract the complex dependence among process variables rather than perform dimensionality reduction or other decoupling processes. For a multimode chemical process, the C-vine copula model of each mode is initially created, in which a multivariate optimization problem is simplified as coping with a series of bivariate copulas listed in a sparse matrix. To measure the distance of the process data from each non-Gaussian mode, a generalized local probability (GLP) index is defined. Consequently, the generalized Bayesian inference-based probability (GBIP) index under a given control limit can be further calculated in real time via searching the density quantile table created offline. The validity and effectiveness of the proposed approach are illustrated using a numerical example and the Tennessee Eastman benchmark process. The results show that the proposed VCDD approach achieves good performance in both monitoring results and computation load.

J	Li, WQ; Zhao, CH; Gao, FR				Li, Wenqing; Zhao, Chunhui; Gao, Furong			Sequential Time Slice Alignment Based Unequal-Length Phase Identification and Modeling for Fault Detection of Irregular Batches	INDUSTRIAL & ENGINEERING CHEMISTRY RESEARCH			English	Article							MULTIVARIATE STATISTICAL-ANALYSIS; TRANSITIONS; PREDICTION; CHARTS	In practice, batch processes may have different durations, revealing unsynchronized operation events, due to the changes in operation conditions or control objectives. For batches with multiple operation phases, batch-wise process characteristics are irregular, and at the same time, phases are misaligned over batches, which have caused problems in phase analysis and modeling as well as online process monitoring. To solve the uneven-length problem in multiphase batch processes, this paper proposes a sequential time slice alignment based unequal-length phase identification and modeling method for fault detection of irregular batches. In comparison with previous work, the major contribution of the proposed method is as follows: (1) The irregular process characteristics are evaluated in sequence and directly related with the monitoring performance. (2) Multiple irregular phases are readily identified and modeled using sequential time slice alignment which avoids cumbersome postprocessing. (3) The sequential nature provides an easy way to real-time judge the phase affiliation of each new sample for online fault detection. Also, comparison is conducted between the proposed algorithm and clustering-based uneven-length phase division and process monitoring algorithm. The application to a typical batch process with varying durations illustrates the online monitoring performance of the proposed method.

Feasibility of Using Adsorbent-Coated Microchannels for Pressure Swing Adsorption: Parametric Studies on Depressurization	INDUSTRIAL & ENGINEERING CHEMISTRY RESEARCH			English	Article							METAL-ORGANIC FRAMEWORKS; MEMBRANE GAS SEPARATION; FLUE-GAS; METHANE SEPARATION; MOLECULAR-SIEVE; CO2 CAPTURE; CU-BTC; CARBON; MIXTURE; REMOVAL	The feasibility of using adsorbent-coated microchannels for a pressure swing adsorption (PSA) process for carbon dioxide removal is investigated by analyzing the effectiveness of depressurization. As a result of large adsorbent particle size and the correspondingly large mass transfer resistances and a diffusion-based process design, the cycle times for conventional adsorbent-bed-based PSA processes are long, and gas removal capacities normalized with adsorbent mass are modest. However, this computational investigation of the depressurization stage that involves the pressure, temperature, and adsorbent capacity response in a microchannel analogous to bed depressurization for Zeolite SA and 13X and activated carbon shows that gas removal capacities during depressurization are greater than those for a conventional bed-based PSA process under the same operating pressure limits, feed compositions, and stage times. An activated carbon monolith yields the highest operating gas removal capacity during depressurization when compared to other adsorbents as a result of the smaller selectivity of the activated carbon. A parametric study on the microchannel geometry shows that an increase in channel size aids in fast depressurization because of the reduced frictional resistance at the microchannel walls. It is found that the use of adsorbent microchannels in adsorption purification techniques can yield benefits through the reduction of total cycle time and overall plant capacity.

To this end, equations that can directly correlate gas solubility with absorption enthalpy were derived through combining the van't Hoff equation with the reaction equilibrium thermodynamic model (RETM). Two typical reaction mechanisms for chemical absorption of CO2 (1:1 and 1:2) were considered for RETM. The variations of gas solubility with enthalpy change were found to be distinctively sigmoid functions, regardless of the investigated temperature and pressure or assumed reaction forms between CO2 and the absorbent molecule. Theoretically calculated variation curves of gas solubility vs enthalpy change agreed well with experimental results reported in literature. On the basis of the trade-off relationship between gas solubility and enthalpy change, criterions for evaluating energy-efficient chemical absorbents for CCO2 capture were proposed.

Results show that these STP solutions exhibit an increase in viscosity (even like gel) under certain conditions. The optimized application conditions of this novel STP are as follows: mass concentration, 0.25-0.30 wt %; salinity, 4.0-8.0 wt %; and temperature range, 40-70 degrees C. Environmental scanning images demonstrate that a clear and solid skeleton network structure is formed and the higher the salinity of the brine, the more compact the three-dimensional (3D) network structure. In addition, in-depth flow diversion and water permeability reduction were the main mechanisms of water shut-off treatment for improved oil recovery in oil displacement experiments. Finally, this novel STP with the ability to create a gel-like system is cost-competitive, simpler to apply, and more environmentally friendly than the current polymer cross-linker system. It provides an alternative candidate for conformance control treatments at injection or production wells.

Interestingly, the regioselective synthesis affords the 2-imino-4-oxothiazolidin-5-ylidene acetate derivatives: the amine nitrogen bonded to an electron-withdrawing substituent becomes part of the imino component, and the amine nitrogen bonded to an electron-donating substituent becomes the heterocyclic nitrogen. This is the first report wherein the impact of substituents in directing the regiocyclization has been explained and the structure conflict resolved by single-crystal X-ray analysis.

The mathematical relationship between the cmc of C12AS and the concentration of an inorganic salt in an aqueous solution was established. The effect of an inorganic salt on micellization of C12AS was also discussed. The results show that the dependence of the cmc of C12AS on an inorganic salt within the range of the effective concentration of the inorganic salt investigated in this experiment can be well described by the linear equation. The decrease of the cmc with an inorganic salt may be mainly attributed to the salting-out effect of the hydrophobic moiety of C12AS. Except for the salting-out. effect, the causes can be partly from the vital contributions of both the electrostatic interaction between ionic heads of C12AS and the hydration of inorganic ions in the process of micellization. Also, the type of inorganic ion can affect the process of micellization. The data of Gibbs energy changes show that there is a spontaneous process of micellization, and the addition of an inorganic salt in an aqueous solution is favorable thermodynamically to the process of micellization.

Chelating ion-exchange resin CDAPE was tested for the uptake of Pb2+ and Cu2+ ions; the adsorption process followed pseudo-second-order kinetics with respective E-a values of 13.4 and 13.8 kJ mol(-1). The adsorption data fitted well to the Langmuir, Freundlich, and Temkin as well as Dubinin-Radushkevich isotherm models. The maximum uptakes of Pb2+ and Cu2+ were determined to be 3.83 and 10.1 mmol g(-1), respectively. The scanning electron microscopy images and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy analysis confirmed that the CDAPE adsorbed the metal ions on the surface as well as throughout the polymer. The negative Delta G degrees and positive Delta H degrees ensured the adsorption process as favorable and endothermic in nature. The excellent adsorption and desorption efficiencies demonstrated by the resin would enable its use for the removal of toxic metal ions from wastewater. A comparison of CDAPE with several other adsorbents in recent works ascertains the excellent efficiency of the current resin for the removal of toxic metal ions.

However, the detailed inter-relationship of formation paths for these products has not yet been discussed properly. In this study, we found that the formation paths of higher alcohols from DMO were inhibited around 473 K. On the basis of these results, a two-reactor system with different reaction temperatures was suggested to obtain less of the higher alcohols and more ethanol. Besides, it is found that a higher density of basic sites in the catalyst favors the formation of higher alcohols. An aluminum dopant was applied to decrease the basic sites in the catalysts accompanied by an increment of ethanol selectivity. When the aluminum-doped catalysts were introduced into the two-reactor system, a further improvement in ethanol selectivity was achieved.

Based on the film stability concepts of Grosser et al. [AlChE J. 1988, 34, 1850. DOT: 10.1002/aic.690341111] as well as Attou and Ferschneider [Chem. Eng. Sci. 2000, SS, 491. DOT: 10.1016/S0009-2509(99)00344-9], two predictive models have been adapted to foams' specific geometric parameters. To account for the different nature of solid foams and their interactions with various fluids, the fixed bed characteristics (specific surface area and bed porosity) and fluid specific parameters (gas and liquid density, liquid viscosity, surface tension) have been incorporated in the model. Ergun parameters and static liquid holdup which are required for the modeling of the prevailing tractive forces were determined experimentally. The modeling results were compared to regime transition measurements performed for SiSiC solid foams with different linear pore densities (20, 30, and 45 PPI), for different reactor diameters (50 and 100 mm) and initial liquid distributors (spray cone nozzle and multipoint distributor) as well as liquids with various physicochemical properties (water, Tergitol, 50% glycerin) under ambient operating conditions. Compared to conventional random fixed bed reactors, the onset of pulsing in solid foam packed fixed beds is significantly shifted toward larger liquid and gas fluxes allowing high throughputs in the trickle regime. Moreover, the homogeneity of initial liquid distribution strongly affects the trickle-to-pulse flow transition.

Effect of Operating Conditions on Dimethyl Ether Steam Reforming over a CuFe2O4/gamma-Al2O3 Bifunctional Catalyst	INDUSTRIAL & ENGINEERING CHEMISTRY RESEARCH			English	Article							FUEL-CELL FEEDS; COMPOSITE CATALYSTS; HYDROGEN-PRODUCTION; HZSM-5 ZEOLITE; DME; SPINEL; METHANOL; CUO-ZNO-AL2O3; DEACTIVATION; REGENERATION	A study is conducted on the effect the operating variables (temperature, space-time, steam/DME molar ratio, DME partial pressure) have on DME steam reforming over CuFe2O4/gamma-Al2O3 bifunctional catalyst in order to obtain high H-2 yield with minimum deactivation by coke. The experiments were carried out in a fluidized bed reactor under the following operating conditions: 250-400 degrees C; space-time, 0.029-1.16 g(catalyst) h/g(DME); steam/DME molar ratio, 3-8; DME partial pressure, 0.05-0.2 atm. A good balance is required between the reaction rates for both steps, DME hydrolysis (on the acid function) and the steam reforming of methanol (on the metallic function), in order to minimize the methanol concentration in the reaction medium because it promotes deactivation of the metallic function. A high steam/DME molar ratio minimizes deactivation. A steady H-2 yield of 82% along 10 h is obtained at 350 degrees C, steam/DME molar ratio of 4, and space-time of 0.58 g(catalyst) h/g(DME).

The structure and properties of the modified ammonium polyphosphate (MAPP) were well-characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and water contact angle (CA). The water CA of MAPP was as high as 148 degrees, which demonstrated that MAPP possessed excellent hydrophobic properties. MAPP and APP were mixed with triazine, which is a char-foaming agent (CFA), and polypropylene (PP) to prepare PP/MAPP/CFA and PP/APP/CFA composites, respectively. The fire retardancy and thermal degradation behavior of PP/MAPP/CFA and PP/APP/CFA composites were investigated by limiting oxygen index (LOI), vertical burning test (UL-94), cone calorimetry, and thermogravimetric analysis. The surface and fracture morphologies were evaluated by SEM. The mechanical properties was analyzed by tensile, flexural, and izod impact tests. The results demonstrated that the MAPP imparted excellent flame retardancy of PP/MAPP/CFA systems, along with a higher LOI value, UL-94 rating, and lower heat release rate and total heat released values. The modification enhanced the interfacial adhesion, mechanical stability, and thermal stability of PP/MAPP/CFA composites. Moreover, PP/MAPP/CFA composites with the thickness of 1.6 mm can still pass the UL-94 V-0 rating after treatment with water for 168 h at 70 degrees C, meanwhile the weight loss rate was decreased from 2.31% for PP/APP/CFA composites to 0.85%, indicating excellent water resistance. This investigation shows a promising formulation for water-resistant intumescent flame-retardant PP composites with extraordinary properties.

The building process involves the movement of building blocks, followed by interaction and binding between them. The diffusion of building blocks is an important kinetic factor influencing the shape development of materials, but this issue has not yet been well investigated by the material research community. In this paper, we take the preparation of silver particles as an example to investigate how the diffusion of building blocks influences the shape of silver products. The silver products are prepared by reducing silver ions in a mixture of ethylene glycol and water. Through a change in the volume ratio of ethylene glycol in water, the diffusion of building blocks is tuned, which results in the formation of silver products with various shapes from rectangular plates to spindle rods. This shape variation is attributed to the change of the diffusion rate of building blocks, and the mechanism underlying these phenomena is investigated by simulation using a newly developed diffusion reaction model. Both the experimental and simulation results indicate that the diffusion of building blocks plays an important role in the shape development of particles, which is expected to arouse more attention to consider mass transfer in the controllable synthesis of materials.

Specifically, state-space representation is modified to capture the structural characteristics of the property-based WAHEN, and a mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) model is formulated correspondingly to minimize the total annualized cost (TAC) of the network. In the proposed model, not only are property and energy integrations carried out simultaneously, but all possible waste regeneration opportunities are considered as well. To enhance the solution quality, sampling and spectral clustering techniques are introduced to capture the common characteristics of classes of good networks and guide the refined search toward a potential global optimum. Three examples are presented in this work to demonstrate the validity and advantages of the proposed approach.

The process has been optimized by means of a feed splitting technique to minimize the energy requirements. The performances of the process have been compared to the ones of a traditional MDEA scrubbing process in terms of energy expenses. The cost of energy has been quantified to build up a merit index function, which allows one to determine the trade-off between the two technologies as a function of the CO2 and H2S content in the feed gas and the geographic area where the gas reserve is located. The results have been discussed on the basis of the cost of energy in different geographic areas, showing the benefits (in terms of energy and operating costs savings) of a low-temperature distillation process when the CO2 content in the natural gas streams is high.

The C5 fraction can be used to manufacture petroleum resin and other high-value-added products. Yet it is often burned as fuel and not fully utilized because separation of these products with close boiling points is difficult. One common process is to react CPD with itself to form high boiling dicyclopentadiene (DCPD) that can then be separated from other C5 molecules. In addition, extractive distillation is also used to recover alkynes from light ends. Such a process involves the use of multiple separation columns and reaction zones. Furthermore, the reactor is highly coupled with one of the separation columns by two recycle streams, which may lead to a snowball effect and difficulty in controlling the process. Hence, many opportunities for process integration and intensification are available. We describe how the entire process with reaction and separation can be substantially simplified by reducing the number of reaction zones from two to one and the number of columns from eight to six. Such a simplification increases not only process operability but also product concentration of DCPD, while maintaining a high purity for the IP stream and a specified purity for the PD plus CP stream. Moreover, capital cost can be greatly decreased with the simplified process. This process can be further intensified by using thermal coupling and external heat integration. Large energy savings can be achieved for the intensified process. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed simplified and intensified process for the separation of a C5 mixture can substantially reduce capital and operating costs as well as improve process operability and increase the main product purity of DCPD.

Chemical looping air separation (CLAS) is a novel approach with a low energy footprint for O-2-CO2 mixed gas production. In this work, a series of Zr-doped Cu-based oxygen carriers were prepared by the sol-gel combustion method and used to produce the O-2-CO2 gas mixture. The effects of doping Zr on phase structure, surface topography, O-2 absorption/desorption, and cyclic reaction of Cu-based oxygen carriers were studied by experiments. The influencing mechanism of Zr doping on O-2 release of Cu-based oxygen carrier was investigated using density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The results indicate that the addition of Zr enlarges the specific surface area and refines the grains. The Zr-doped Cu-based oxygen carriers have high desorption reaction rates. The oxygen release capacity increases with the increasing Zr doping amount. The cyclic operation indicates that the Zr-doped Cu-based oxygen carriers have high cyclic stability. The DFT calculation results show that, compared with the pure CuO, the Zr-doped CuO has lower oxygen vacancy formation energy, lower energy barriers for oxygen desorption and O anion diffusion, and narrower band gap, which indicates that the Zr-doped CuO releases oxygen more easily than the pure CuO and has a lower energy barrier of electron transfer, thus leading to a higher reactivity.

The studied process is adsorption using a fixed-bed column packed with granular activated carbon (GAC). An original setup was designed to perform the isotherms. Small particle sizes and full-scale GAC were tested. Adsorption capacity decreases with increasing particle size in the presence of natural organic matter. Columns running in dynamic-mode PCE in-feed were used to test three operating conditions. Sampling along the columns was used to monitor PCE concentration in the liquid phase at different column lengths. A large data set was collected. A mathematical model based on mass balance of PCE was adopted to predict the adsorption dynamics under various operating conditions. Global mass transfer coefficients were identified to find the best fit with the experimental data. The model was reliable and accurate over the whole data set. The performances of the fixed bed were evaluated in terms of operation time, total volume of decontaminated water, and degree of GAC utilization. The results showed that a trade-off has to be found between these performance parameters. The model developed here can be used to design full-scale fixed-bed columns and optimize the three key parameters.

In this research, EC was used to remove Endosulfan from aqueous solution. The results show that the best conditions that obtained in this study are pH = 4, current density = 6.2 mA/cm(2), initial concentration of Endosulfan = 30 mg/L, and electrolysis time = 60 min. The solution conductivity seems to have no significant effect on the removal efficiency. Artificial neural network (ANN) was utilized to model the experimental data. The model was developed by using three layer feed-forward neural network with eight neurons in the hidden layer for modeling of EC process. A comparison between the predicted results and experimental data gave high correlation coefficient (R-2 = 0.976) and showed that the model is able to predict the removal efficiency.

Building Blocks for Ionic Liquids: Vapor Pressures and Vaporization Enthalpies of N-Functionalized Imidazoles with Branched and Cycloalkyl Substituents	INDUSTRIAL & ENGINEERING CHEMISTRY RESEARCH			English	Article							STRUCTURE-PROPERTY RELATIONSHIPS; ALKYL CHAIN-LENGTH; PHYSICOCHEMICAL PROPERTIES; THERMOPHYSICAL PROPERTIES; CO2 SEPARATIONS; REORIENTATIONAL DYNAMICS; PHYSICAL SOLVENTS; DEPENDENCE; ALKYLIMIDAZOLES; SIMULATION	The imidazole structure offers a versatile means of developing molecules with controlled/tunable physicochemical properties that have significant utility in many applications and can be further derivatized to form ionic liquids. In the literature, the vast majority of studies on structure-property relationships in these types of molecules are devoted to linear (e.g., n-alkyl) substituents. However, imidazoles with branched or cydoalkyl groups are equally accessible through convenient synthetic methods - yet there are essentially no reports on the physical properties of such compounds in the literature. Here, the absolute vapor pressures of branched and cycloalkyl derivatives of imidazole have been determined as a function of temperature by the transpiration method. The standard molar enthalpies of vaporization were derived from the temperature dependences of vapor pressures. The measured data sets were successfully checked for internal consistency by comparison with vaporization enthalpies of the parent species, and a group contribution method is put forth by which the vaporization enthalpies of imidazoles, and imidazolium-based ILs, with alkyl groups in any configuration can be rapidly predicted.

Our study quantifies comonomer content variation for LLDPE particles with different sizes. Powder from the fluidized-bed reactor was sieved to subsets with different sizes. FTIR showed a meaningful difference in average comonomer content among subsets. To study comonomer content distribution in each subset, successive self-nucleation and annealing (SSA) thermal fractionation via differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) was performed. This study showed that each subset not only differs in the average comonomer content but also in comonomer content distribution. Particles with a median diameter of 1500 mu m had the highest average comonomer content, which was different from that of the final product. Minimum average comonomer content and narrowest comonomer distribution was observed in the smallest particles with median diameter of 750 mu m and high molecular weight.

A method for sample preparation is proposed, and comments on adaptation of the technique and troubleshooting are addressed and discussed. The NTA was able to measure the particle size of a trimetallic catalyst dispersed in bitumen obtaining a mode size of 111 nm, with particles ranging from 40 to 1000 nm and 80% of them between 57 and 176 nm. NTA data was compared to the particle size obtained by depositing the same catalyst on sand and analyzing it through SEM-EDX, obtaining the same particle size range. Refinement of the sample preparation method and measuring parameters are suggested.

Coprocessing of Agricultural Plastic Waste and Switchgrass via Tail Gas Reactive Pyrolysis	INDUSTRIAL & ENGINEERING CHEMISTRY RESEARCH			English	Article							CATALYTIC FAST PYROLYSIS; LOW-DENSITY POLYETHYLENE; FLUIDIZED-BED REACTOR; CO-PYROLYSIS; BIOMASS; OIL; CELLULOSE; PRODUCTS; CRACKING; SCALE	Pyrolysis of mixtures of agricultural plastic waste in the form of polyethylene hay bale covers (PE) (4-37%) and switchgrass were investigated using the US Department of Agriculture's tail gas reactive pyrolysis (TGRP) process at different temperatures (400-570 degrees C). TGRP of switchgrass and plastic mixtures significantly reduced the formation of waxy solids that are produced during regular pyrolysis. Under an atmosphere of approximately 70% recycled tail gas, mostly noncondensable gases were produced along with highly deoxygenated and aromaticized pyrolysis oil. When the atmosphere was diluted further to a recycled tail gas concentration of about 55%, higher yields of liquid product were achieved but with less deoxygenation. TGRP of low plastic mixtures (4-8%) produced oils with increased carbon and reduced oxygen content compared to the fast pyrolysis of switchgrass alone. Noncondensable gas fractions containing high concentrations of H-2, CO, ethylene, and other light hydrocarbons remained a significant portion of the product mixture at temperatures above 500 degrees C.

Synthesized MFe2O4 are composed of primary nanocrystallites mainly ranging from 8 to 20 nm and show uniform aggregations with size of 200-400 nm. As heterogeneous catalysts, it is clearly noted that CuFe2O4 NAs have the highest catalytic activity for the reduction of nitroaromatic compounds compared to NiFe2O4, CoFe2O4, and ZnFe2O4. The highest rate constant of 36.17 min(-1).g(-1) is achieved at a low catalyst usage (10 mu L, 0.2 mg.mL(-1)). The remarkably enhanced catalytic performance of CuFe2O4 NAs is mainly attributed to the promoted electron transfer on Cu2+ active sites, which is facilitated by unique spinel structures and chainlike aggregate morphology. It is demonstrated that flame spray pyrolysis technique is an effective route to produce binary or complex oxides for potential industrial use.

The experimental results were modeled mathematically by considering the surface areas of the particles changing dynamically through the reaction; moreover, a surface factor was introduced in order to account for the nonsphericity of the particles. The surface areas were measured by means of gas adsorption and by particle size distribution (laser diffraction). Liquid-phase concentrations were measured by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry, and surface compositions were measured by X-ray spectroscopy. Furthermore, scanning electron microscope images of the samples are presented. Subsequently, an optimization model of a scrubber was developed by using the intrinsic parameters of the samples, which were determined experimentally. The optimization results indicate that up to 34-50% of the power required for milling can be saved by milling to a coarser particle size than the commonly used size of 44 mu m, depending on the sample type. The present model of the lab-scale experimental study and the optimization model can be employed to estimate the actual impact that using different types of raw material would have in the operation of a wet flue gas desulfurization scrubber.

Propylene/Propane Mixture Separation Characteristics and Stability of Carbon Molecular Sieve Membranes	INDUSTRIAL & ENGINEERING CHEMISTRY RESEARCH			English	Article							GAS SEPARATION; ZIF-8 MEMBRANES; BINARY-MIXTURES; OLEFIN/PARAFFIN SEPARATION; OXYGEN-CHEMISORPTION; INORGANIC MEMBRANES; COMPOSITE MEMBRANES; POLYMERIC MEMBRANES; SILICA MEMBRANES; POLYIMIDE	Propylene/propane mixture separation properties of high quality carbon molecular sieve (CMS) membranes prepared on mesoporous gamma-alumina supports were studied at different feed pressures (up to 100 psia), feed compositions, and permeation temperatures. The membrane exhibits a mixture propylene/propane selectivity of above 30 under the studied conditions, with no plasticization effect observed at feed pressures up to 100 psia (similar to 700 kPa). Temperature dependences of the permeance and selectivity suggest a diffusion dominated mechanism for the permeation and separation of propylene/propane through the CMS membrane. The propylene/propane separation characteristics tend to stabilize after a decline in gas permeance and an increase in propylene/propane selectivity while on stream of propylene/propane mixture for 10 days. The initial changes in separation properties of the CMS membrane are due to the reduction in the effective pore size caused by oxygen chemisorption and physical aging of the pore structure. CMS membranes can be preaged under proper conditions to stabilize the structure and separation performance for practical separation application.	[Ma, Xiaoli; Williams, Suzanne; Lin, Y.

The calculated results indicate that the axial mixing lowered the concentration gradient along the column, and the polydispersity caused the maldistribution of the interfacial area and the volume for the different sized drops, which also reduced the mass transfer performance. In order to evaluate the degree of the axial mixing and the polydispersity, the important variables affecting axial dispersion coefficient (E-M), emulsion phase holdup (Phi), and drop size distribution (alpha and beta) including rotating speed, flow ratio, total flow, surfactant concentration, and stirring paddle width were also studied. It was found that the standard deviation of the drop size (beta) had same variation trend as the mean drop size (alpha). The increase in the rotating speed and the paddle width enhanced the turbulence which increased the E-M and the Phi and simultaneously decreased the alpha and the beta. The increase in the flow ratio markedly increased the Phi, the alpha, and the beta, whereas the increase in the total flow signally increased the E-M. The increase in the surfactant concentration primarily decreased the alpha and the beta; meanwhile, the membrane leakage was obviously inhibited. Finally, the dimensionless correlations were established to predict these hydrodynamic parameters (E-M, Phi, alpha, and beta) with the AAREs of 5.2%, 7.5%, 2.7%, and 4.4%, respectively.

Proper prediction of the VLLE is necessary to improve this processing step in the Fischer-Tropsch process; however, there is little guidance on what thermodynamic models to use. A similar problem presents itself in processes related to biomass conversion. The selection of an appropriate thermodynamic model to describe the nonideal VLLE of water-oxygenate-hydrocarbon mixtures was investigated. Cubic equations of state, virial equations of state, activity coefficient models, and equations of state with advanced mixing rules were considered. The evaluation was conducted using both default and optimized parameters. Predictive performance was improved when binary interaction parameters were optimized using experimental data, but parameter optimization is onerous and it is not always practical. It was found that cubic equations of state should not be used for nonideal systems, and even when combined with advanced mixing rules, there is a risk of poor predictive performance. Although the nonrandom two-liquid (NRTL) activity coefficient model is often considered for polar compounds, this investigation found that the predictive performance of NRTL degraded as the nonideality of the system increased. The universal quasi-chemical (UNIQUAC) activity coefficient model was the best all-around model for predicting the phase behavior of water-oxygenate-hydrocarbon systems. The Hayden-O'Connell virial equation of state predicted the vapor-liquid phase equilibrium of hydrogen bonding materials well. UNIQUAC in tandem with the Hayden-O'Connell equation of state is recommended for the modeling of Fischer-Tropsch syncrude VLLE when the partitioning of oxygenates between phases is important.

Water and glass beads (Geldart D type) are adopted as the liquid and solid phases, respectively. The evolution of flow pattern of a wet spouted bed is captured by a CCD camera. The experimental results indicate that the minimum spouting velocity decreases when increasing the liquid saturation. The increase of initial bed height, particle size, or spout nozzle size leads to increased minimum spouting velocities. A correlation is formulated based on the experiments results for the prediction of minimum spouting velocities of wet spouted beds. Moreover, it is found that the maximum spoutable bed height H-max decreases as particle size or spout nozzle diameter increases. However, H-max is almost constant, approximately 1.5 times higher than that of its corresponding dry spouted bed, when increasing the liquid saturation.

A set of 28 kinetic runs was performed over a commercial CuCl2/gamma-Al2O3 catalyst in a dedicated tubular flow reactor setup operating in a chemical regime. The design of the experiments, covering the effects of temperature, pressure, C2H4 feed molar fraction, and C2H4/HCl and C2H4/O-2 feed molar ratios, was planned according to a composite fractional factorial design. Nineteen adaptive rate constants were successfully estimated by multiresponse nonlinear regression of the experimental data. The resulting kinetic model was able to reproduce the experimental 1,2-dichloroethane yields with relative errors below 10% for most of the kinetic runs. We also report the development of two mathematical models of oxychlorination fluidized-bed reactors, namely the simple two-phase (STP) and the axially dispersed plug-flow (ADPF) model, as well as their comparative validation against industrial data. Being characterized by gas superficial velocities typically higher than the transition velocity and being therefore operated in the turbulent fluidization regime, the performances of commercial reactor units are better predicted by the ADPF rather than by the STP model.

This correction is based on information on the molecular structure and is optimized by using the least-squares method to minimize the deviation between theoretical and experimental enthalpies for some fatty acids and esters. The mean absolute deviation between calculated and experimental enthalpies decreased from 122.3 to 5.3 kJ mol(-1) when the parametric correction equation was applied to the B3LYP/6-311+G(d,p) results for fatty acid molecules. The calculated data were used to estimate thermochemical properties of the esterification reactions of oleic and linoleic acids with methanol. Results confirmed the endothermic and the nonspontaneous characteristics of these reactions. Thus, the proposed correction is a suitable alternative to calculate thermodynamic properties of fatty acids and esters, with remarkable accuracy and low computational cost.	[Silva, Marcos V.

Herein, we describe a tandem, bicatalytic continuous flow cyclopropanation-homo-Nazarov-type ring-opening cyclization to form hydropyrido[1,2-a]indoles, which represents a naturally occurring chemical scaffold present in many bioactive and therapeutically relevant molecules. The tandem flow reactions provided high conversions (>97%) with product throughputs on the order of 3-5 g h(-1). The individual transformations (cyclopropanation and ring-opening cyclization) were separately optimized in the batch then successfully transferred to the flow. Significantly, this represents the first literature example of continuous flow cydopropane ring-opening cydizations; hydropyrido[1,2-a]indoles are formed on a multigram scale (>4 g h(-1) throughput) in near-quantitative yields from N-indolyl-1,1-cyclopropyl beta-amidoesters. Overall, the continuous flow technology exhibited superior yields, relative to the batch reactions, for both the ring-opening cyclizations and the tandem, bicatalytic reactions. These results provide the basis for large-scale implementation of bicatalytic cyclopropanation-ring-opening cyclization reactions for complex synthesis and represent initial efforts toward the development of an industrially viable, four-step continuous flow synthesis of hydropyrido [1,2-a]indoles.

However, their structures need optimizing to improve their erosion and mechanical properties. We have prepared copolymer of 2-methylene-1,3-dioxepane (MDO), tributylsilyl methacrylate (TBSM) and methyl methacrylate (MMA) via radical ring-opening copolymerization. Such polymer has a degradable backbone and hydrolyzable side groups. Our study demonstrates that as the ester units in the backbone increase, the degradation rate increases but the swelling decreases in seawater. The degradation is controlled by the polymer composition or the molar ratio of the ester units in the backbone to the silyl ester side groups. Moreover, such polymer can serve as a carrier and controlled release system for organic antifoulants. Marine field tests show that the system consisting of the copolymer and organic antifoulant has good antifouling performance depending on the polymer composition. It can effectively inhibit the colonization and growth of marine organisms when MDO content is above 20 wt %.

The synthesis was performed using two controlled polymerization techniques. The PMMA macromonomer was obtained by high-vacuum anionic polymerization followed by the copolymerization of n-butyl acrylate and PMMA macromonomer using reversible addition fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerization to yield the desired all-acrylic multigraft structures. The PnBA-g-PMMA multigraft structures exhibit randomly spaced branch points with various PMMA contents, ranging from 15 to 40 vol %, allowing an investigation into how physical properties vary with differences in the number of branch points and molecular weight of grafted side chains. The determination of molecular weight and polydispersity indices of both the PMMA macromonomer and the graft copolymers was carried out using size exclusion chromatography with triple detection, and the structural characteristics of both the macromonomer and PnBA-g-PMMA graft materials were characterized by H-1 and C-13 NMR. Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry was employed for monitoring the macromonomer synthesis. Thermal characteristics of the materials were analyzed using differential scanning calorimetry and thermogravimetric analysis. The mechanical performance of the graft materials was characterized by rheology and dynamic mechanical analysis, revealing that samples with PMMA. content of 25-40 vol % exhibit superior elastomeric properties as compared to materials containing short PMMA side chains or <25 vol % PMMA. Lastly, atomic force microscopy showed a varying degree of microphase separation between the glassy and rubbery components that is strongly dependent on PMMA side chain molecular weight.

Preparation and Characterization of Biochar Sorbents Produced from Malt Spent Rootlets	INDUSTRIAL & ENGINEERING CHEMISTRY RESEARCH			English	Article							PYROLYSIS TEMPERATURE; AQUEOUS-SOLUTIONS; CHEMICAL-COMPOSITION; SORPTION; ADSORPTION; REMOVAL; YIELD; SLOW; SIZE	The present study aims at the preparation and characterization of biochars produced from malt spent rootlets (MSR) under different pyrolysis temperatures. The biochars were characterized for their surface area, microporosity, suspension pH, acid-base behavior, and functional groups on their surface. The highest surface area (340 m(2)/g) and porosity (0.21 cm(2)/g) were observed for MSR pyrolized at 800 degrees C. For the same biochar, 67% of the pore volume corresponds to micropores (<2 nm). The high-temperature biochars resulted in highly alkaline suspensions (pH 9.9) compared to MSR suspensions (pH 5.3). The functional groups (e.g., hydroxyl, phosphonic, amine, or carbon-bonded sulfhydryl) found on the MSR surface disappear as the pyrolysis temperature increases without new ones forming. Thus, the surface charge of high-temperature biochars is low. For phenanthrene, the sorption capacity of biochars pyrolyzed at or above 750 degrees C increases by almost 1 order of magnitude compared to the raw material. For mercury, sorption capacity of biochars increases by a maximum factor of 4 and a factor of 6 for low- (300-500 degrees C) and high-temperature (750-900 degrees C) biochars, respectively.

Many variables are important for the formation and properties of the resultant helical fibers. In this paper, the effects of electric field and material factors on the helical fiber formation are explored. The role of the electric field is studied for three coelectrospinning systems, off-centered core shell, coaxial and side-by-side. Electric field simulations are performed to explain the experimental results. To explore the effect of material factors on the fiber formation, three polymer systems, Poly(m-phenylene isophthalamide) (Nomex)/polyurethane (TPU), polystyrene (PS)/TPU and polyacrylonitril (PAN)/TPU are used. By analyzing the polymer structure, interface interaction between the two phase of the system, and the dissolution of the polymer, the Nomex/TPU system has been identified to have the best potential for producing helical nanofibers.

The use of a miscible organic cosolvent as additive may improve the physical properties of the dissolving fluid, as compared to those of the ionic liquid alone. Alternatively, this organic substance added in larger amounts can act as antisolvent for the regeneration of the nonvolatile lignocellulose fractions dissolved. In this work, mixtures of methanol and 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium acetate (an archetypal ionic liquid for dissolution of lignocelluloses) were characterized from a thermal and physical point of view. Their ability to dissolve representative standards of the lignocellulose biopolymers (cellulose, hemicellulose, lignin) was assessed. Very different solubilities of the three biopolymer standards were observed as a function of composition of the solvent, suggesting the possibility of a selective dissolution procedure to separate mixtures of the disengaged polymers. Precipitation tests showed that fractionated recovery of the dissolved biopolymers from the ionic liquid was not possible by direct addition of moderate amounts of methanol, due to formation of gel-like phases.

Application of Euler-Lagrange Approach to Predict the Droplet Solidification in a Prilling Tower	INDUSTRIAL & ENGINEERING CHEMISTRY RESEARCH			English	Article							HEAT-TRANSFER; SIMULATION; FLOW; GRANULATION; PARTICLES	This paper deals with the phenomenological characteristics of the multiphase flow in a 3D urea prilling tower under conditions close to those of the industrial-scale process, considering the simultaneous heat and momentum transfer and the droplet solidification, using the computational fluid dynamics technique. The Euler-Lagrange approach is used to represent the multiphase flow. Solidification of the droplets was considered by means of an unsolidified core model, which predicts the thickness of the solid phase formed from the surface to the center of the droplets during the evolution of their trajectories in the continuous phase. The global operational performance of the process was evaluated on the basis of the solidification and breaking indexes defined from local variables obtained from numerical simulations. Solidification index values in the range of 0.83-1.00 were obtained from simulations, and the internal resistance to heat transfer was found to strongly affect the solidification phenomenon. A nonsymmetrical flow was used to evaluate the breaking index of droplets broken because of impact with the walls.

Water content of three natural gas mixtures was measured in this work using a Panametrics moisture analyzer at low temperatures and pressures up to 40 MPa. The statistical associating fluid theory (PC-SAFT) combined with a modified van der Waals and Platteeuw (vdWP) theory was used to model the system phase behavior. The theory was found to be in good agreement with experimental data, thus exhibiting the predictive ability of the proposed model.

In the first reaction step, TG (soybean) oil was noncatalytically cracked and purified by distillation to produce an organic liquid product (OLP). The resulting OLP was then converted into aromatic compounds in a second reaction using a zeolite catalyst, HZSM-5. In this second reaction, three main factors were found to influence the yield of aromatic hydrocarbons: the SiO2 center dot Al2O3 ratio in the HZSM-5, the reaction temperature and the OLP-to-catalyst ratio. Upon cursory optimization, up to 58 w/w% aromatics were obtained. Detailed analyses revealed that most of the alkenes and carboxylic acids, and even many of the unidentified/unresolved compounds, which are characteristic products of noncatalytic TG cracking, were reformed into aromatic hydrocarbons. Instead of BTEX compounds, which are the common products of C-2-C-8 alkene and other feedstock reforming with HZSM-5, longer-chain alkylbenzenes dominated the reformate (along with medium-size n-alkanes). Another novel feature of the two-step process was a sizable (up to 13 w/w%) concentration of alicyclic hydrocarbons, both cyclohexanes and cydopentanes. Thus, this novel two-step process may provide a new route for the production of renewable aromatic hydrocarbons as an important coproduct with transportation fuel products.

Catalytic Coating for Reduced Coke Formation in Steam Cracking Reactors	INDUSTRIAL & ENGINEERING CHEMISTRY RESEARCH			English	Article							DIMETHYL DISULFIDE; REACTION-KINETICS; RUN-LENGTH; PYROLYSIS; SIMULATION; HYDROCARBONS; NAPHTHA; INHIBITION; RADIATION; CHEMICALS	A novel catalytic coating that converts coke to carbon oxides through a reaction with steam has been developed. Several coating formulations were tested in a jet-stirred reactor setup, and the best performing formulation was further evaluated in a pilot plant setup. Application of the coating during steam cracking of ethane at industrially relevant conditions resulted in a reduction of the asymptotic coking rate by 76%. The coating activity remained constant over several coking/decoking cycles. Coupled furnace-reactor run length simulations of an industrial ethane cracking unit were performed and resulted in an increase of the run length by a factor of 6. However, the simulated CO2 yield is higher than the design value of a typical caustic tower.

The effect reforming temperature in the 600-700 degrees C range has on product yields and gas composition as well as on the amount and nature of the coke deposited on the catalyst has been studied. The reforming leads to a full transformation of C2+ hydrocarbons and tar. The maximum H-2 yield is obtained at 700 degrees C (36 wt % by mass unit of HDPE in the feed, which accounts for 83 wt % of the maximum H-2 yield according to stoichiometry), with CH4 conversion being 94% and the coke amount deposited on the Ni catalyst being minimum (3.3 wt % by mass unit of HDPE in the feed). The syngas obtained by reforming at 700 degrees C has a H-2/CO volumetric ratio of 6 and is suitable for hydrogenation reactions and further valorization to produce H-2.

Saturation Temperature and Vapor Pressure Predictions of the LiNO3-KNO3-NaNO (3)/H2O System with the Modified Brunauer, Emmett, and Teller Model	INDUSTRIAL & ENGINEERING CHEMISTRY RESEARCH			English	Article							SOLID-LIQUID EQUILIBRIA; PHASE-DIAGRAM; WATER ACTIVITIES; BET MODEL; SALT; ELECTROLYTE; SOLUBILITY; THERMODYNAMICS; MIXTURES; NITRATE	Mixtures of alkali nitrates in water have good potential to be used as working fluids in absorption refrigeration systems. In this study the extended version of the Brunauer, Emmett, and Teller (BET) model has been used to predict the saturation temperature and vapor pressure of LiNO3-KNO3-NaNO (3)/H2O mixtures with two salt ratio values (53:28:19 and 53:42:05). The parameters of the model were obtained from the literature, with the exception of the equilibrium constant of potassium nitrate, which was obtained from solubility data of the KNO3/H O-2 system. The results were in good agreement with the experimental data reported in the literature. Using the concept of the supersaturation index, the model also predicted the salt present in the solid phase in the solid-liquid equilibrium. To validate the predictive capacity of the model, an experimental study of the crystallization of the solutions at temperatures of 325.15 and 335.15 K was conducted. The results obtained proved to be in good agreement with predictions. Finally, the information obtained was used to construct the Duhring diagram, which is very important for the design and simulation of the thermodynamic cycles of absorption refrigeration systems.

In addition, new atmospheric pressure data on densities of 1,2-dichloroethane from 278.15 to 348.15 K are presented. These experimental data have been implemented for calculating densities, isobaric heat capacities and coefficients of thermal expansion, isentropic and isothermal compressibilities, and internal pressures as functions of pressure and temperature by using an acoustic method of Davis-Gordon-Sun. Development of a new Design Institute for Physical Properties (DIPPR)-based version of the fluctuation theory-based Tait-like equation of state (FT-EoS) is presented. This model could become a simple and reliable tool implementing the DIPPR's saturated state expressions for predicting the high-pressure densities and speeds of sound. It has also been demonstrated that both compounds under consideration can be included in the applicability range of the predictive critical point-based perturbed-chain statistical association fluid theory (CP-PC-SAFT) approach employing the DIPPR's critical constants. In spite of its poor modeling of vapor pressures of these substances away from their critical points, CP-PC-SAFT appears as a robust estimator of various thermodynamic properties of both pure compounds and mixtures in the entire pressure range, and as well of the high-pressure phase equilibria. Unlike CP-PC-SAFT, parametrization of PC-SAFT comprises fitting large experimental databases, and it cannot be implemented for simultaneous modeling of the critical and the subcritical states. Although this model is the less successful estimator of sound velocities and compressibilities, it has a doubtless advantage in modeling the low-pressure phase equilibria.

For this purpose, the UV-vis absorption spectrum was applied to study the inclusion behavior of monoammonium phosphate (MAP) with beta-CD. The results revealed that MAP with beta-CD can form a 1:1 stoichiometry inclusion compound; the applicable inclusion time was 10 h, and the formation process of the inclusion compound was an exothermic process. The 1:1 beta-CD-MAP inclusion compound was further characterized by FT-IR, H-1 NMR, and P-31 NMR. The adsorption-desorption processes of MAP without and with beta-CD in the soil solution was studied. It was found that the K-f value of MAP with beta-CD was 3.293 and was lower than the K-f value of MAP without beta-CD; the eta value of MAP with beta-CD was 0.8050 and was higher than the n value of MAP without beta-CD. Furthermore, the total percentages of MAP desorbed (eta) at the different employed MAP initial concentrations in the presence of beta-CD were 9.3%, 15.7%, and 18.6%, and were higher than the eta in the absence of beta-CD, respectively. The results showed that the effectiveness of MAP has been improved in soil and the presence of beta-CD can play an important role in the adsorption of MAP on soil surfaces. In addition, the morphologies of soil particles in the presence of MAP and the beta-CD-MAP inclusion compound were observed by SEM. SEM observations revealed that the beta-CD-MAP inclusion compound fertilizer system could over soil hardening.

In this work, the ability of synthesized HMCS to coagulate Escherichia coli cells was demonstrated. In order to facilitate the removal of coagulated E. coli cells using an applied magnetic field, HMCS was grafted on to the surface of magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs). Such modified MNPs interacted with Gram-negative bacteria such as E. coli by means of strong hydrophobic forces between the hydrophobic tails of HMCS and outer membrane of E. coli. The highest E. coli removal capacity achieved by MNPs@HMCS was 1.38 x 10(8) cells/mg. The characterization of CS, HMCS, CS/HMCS grafted MNPs (MNPs@CS, MNPs@HMCS) were carried out by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), elemental analysis (EA), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). The degree of deacetylation (DDA) and the degree of substitution (DS) of the synthesized HMCS are 81% and 11%, respectively.

Liquid vapor mass transfer is considered in the reactor model, and the kinetic expression using Langmuir-Hinshelwood model considers competitive adsorption of reactants, products, and solvents. The activation energies of every elementary reaction and adsorption enthalpies of nitrogen compounds are calculated. The kinetic modeling shows that the hydrogenation of 1,2,3,4-tetrahydroquinoline into decahydroquinoline is the rate-determining step of the principal reaction pathway. The self-inhibition effect due to competitive adsorption of nitrogen-containing compounds is confirmed. The adsorption constants of nitrogen compounds decrease in the order saturated amines > NH3 > aromatic amines, showing that their adsorption strength is related to the basicity of molecules. Moreover, the kinetic model is validated by an additional experiment using ammonia as an inhibitor.

In this process, SO2 is captured by storing in the pores of carbons in the form of H2SO4, and regeneration of the SO2-captured materials is necessary to recover SO2 capture ability. V2O5-supported activated coke (V2O5/AC) has been reported to be highly active for SO2 removal, and its regeneration has been investigated from the viewpoint of the reaction mechanism. This work studied the regeneration kinetics with the aid of a thermogravimetric analyzer coupled with a mass spectrometer. The SO2-captured sample was prepared in a fixed-bed reactor with a simulated flue gas containing 1500 ppm of SO2, 5% O-2, and 5% H2O. The kinetic equation was obtained by fitting the H2SO4 conversion (a) at different heating rates with nonisothermal kinetic methods called Flynn-Wall-Ozawa and Coats-Redfern. The results indicated that the regeneration kinetic behavior varies with a. At alpha = 0.1-0.4, regeneration follows first-order reaction model f(alpha) = 1 - alpha with an activation energy of about 85.7 kJ/mol. At alpha = 0.5-0.8, regeneration follows three-dimensional diffusion model f(alpha) = 1.5(1 - alpha)(2/3)[1 - (1 - alpha)(1/3)](-1), with the activation energy increasing from 88.9 kJ/mol at alpha = 0.5 to 112.1 kJ/mol at alpha = 0.8.

Supercritical Water Gasification of Lactose as a Model Compound for Valorization of Dairy Industry Effluents	INDUSTRIAL & ENGINEERING CHEMISTRY RESEARCH			English	Article							HYDROGEN-PRODUCTION; HYDROTHERMAL GASIFICATION; BIOMASS GASIFICATION; CHEESE WHEY; METHANE PRODUCTION; RU/AL2O3 CATALYST; HIGH-TEMPERATURE; WASTE; GLYCEROL; PROTEINS	The dairy industry effluents, including whey waste and milk-based residues, are enriched in lactose and minor amounts of glucose that could potentially be converted to biofuels and biochemicals. Lactose was used in this work as a model compound of dairy effluents for gasification in supercritical water using a continuous flow tubular reactor. Four parameters impacting supercritical water gasification were studied, namely, temperature (550-700 degrees C), residence time (30-75 s), feed concentration (4-10 wt %), and catalyst concentration (0.2-0.8 wt %). The best total gas yields, carbon gasification efficiency, H-2 yields, and other major gases (CO2 and CH4) were obtained at 700 degrees C using a feed concentration of 4 wt % lactose and a residence time of 60 s at fixed pressure of 25 MPa. Furthermore, catalytic lactose gasification involving 0.8 wt % Na2CO3 resulted in maximum H-2 yield (22.4 mol/mol) compared to those obtained by 0.8 wt % K2CO3 (21.5 mol/mol) and noncatalytic gasification (16 mol/mol).

We characterized the structure, surface morphology, particle size distribution, and thermal properties of prepared nanocapsules using methods such as the Fourier infrared spectrum, scanning electron microscopy analysis, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), differential scanning calorimetry analysis, and thermogravirnetric analysis. The effects of surfactant concentration and monomer/n-octadecane mass ratios on the average diameter and phase change properties of nanoencapsulated n-octadecane were investigated. The average diameter of nanocapsules is similar to 300-500 nm. The surface is quite smooth and compact. An obvious core shell structure can be observed from TEM images, and the thickness of the shell is similar to 50 nm. When the n-octadecane/monomer mass ratio is 5:4, the encapsulation efficiency of the nanocapsules reaches the highest point at 52.9%.

The composite material uses sodium silicate as a binder of active CaO particles. The observed mechanical stability of the material is due to the formation of hard Ca silicates resulting from the reaction of the binder with the exterior of the CaO particles. A screening of the main synthesis variables affecting the composite was carried out, including Ca precursors of different particle size, a range of molar Ca/Si ratios, as well as the curing and calcination conditions. The most suitable material (containing CaCO3 with a particle size of 36-63 mu m as calcium precursor and a molar Ca/Si ratio of 4.8-6.2, calcined in air at 850 degrees C) was tested over many hydration/dehydration cycles (up to 500) in a thermogravimetric apparatus. The material sustained high molar hydration conversions (between 0.6 and 0.7) and crushing strength values of >2 N after 200 cycles, when dehydrated in pure steam.

In this work, we report halloysite clay nanotubes (HNTs) loaded with different surfactants for crude oil spill remediation. The effectiveness of HNT loaded with the surfactants Tween 80, dioctyl sodium sulfosuccinate (DOSS, D), Span 80 (S) and modified soybean lecithin phosphatidylinositol (Lecithin FPI, LFPI) in crude oil spill remediation was examined with the U.S. EPA's baffled flask test. The release kinetics of the surfactants from the HNT were studied. Ternary diagrams (Span 80-DOSS-Tween 80, Lecithin FPI-DOSS-Tween 80 and Lecithin FPI-Tween-80 Span 80) for the dispersion effectiveness of the surfactant-loaded HNT were then generated. 99 vol % dispersion effectiveness was attained by HNT loaded with ternary food grade surfactants Span 80, Tween 80 and Lecithin FPI. An environmentally friendly oil spill dispersant was therefore formulated using naturally occurring HNT and FDA approved food grade surfactants.

The structure and physical properties of IL grafted PVDF (PVDF-g-IL) were investigated. Both the extraction experiments and H-1 NMR results indicated the successful grafting of IL onto PVDF molecular chains. It was calculated that IL grafting yield was approximately 3.9 per 100 repeating units of PVDF, suggesting very short IL grafting sequences. The melting temperatures (T-m) of the PVDF-g-IL films decreased with absorbed dose, suggesting the occurrence of crystal defects of PVDF caused by the irradiation. However, the morphologies, crystal forms and crystal long periods (L) of PVDF-g-IL films were not significantly influenced by the irradiation. Moreover, the effects of IL grafting and absorbed dose on physical properties of PVDF-g-IL films were investigated. It was found that the irradiation could immobilize IL molecules onto PVDF chains and thus suppressed their migration in electric filed. Therefore, the grafted samples showed lower dielectric loss, electrical conductivity as well as dielectric permittivity compared with the unirradiated blends. Moreover, the elongation at break of the grafted PVDF decreased with the applied irradiation dose, but the Young's modulus increased. The as-prepared PVDF-g-IL composites exhibited large dielectric permittivity, low dielectric loss and, in particular, excellent toughness, which is promising for use in dielectric capacitor applications.

Seeding and Optimization of Batch Reactive Crystallization	INDUSTRIAL & ENGINEERING CHEMISTRY RESEARCH			English	Article							L-GLUTAMIC ACID; BARIUM-SULFATE CRYSTALLIZATION; COOLING CRYSTALLIZATION; NUCLEATION KINETICS; GROWTH-KINETICS; PRECIPITATION	Conceptual methods are illustrated for the development of operating policies for batch reactive crystallization processes. Two processes, production of barium sulfate and production of L-glutamic acid, are studied. For barium sulfate, the critical seed loading ratio is found to be above the practical limit, which suggests that seeding cannot be employed to suppress nucleation. Conversely, for L-glutamic acid, the critical seed loading ratio is below the practical limit for a wide range of seed sizes, suggesting that seeding can be used to suppress nucleation almost entirely. These results are verified by rigorous process simulation. Furthermore, for the barium sulfate process, a plot of nucleation rate B versus growth rate G is concave, indicating that an early growth trajectory (with supersaturation highest at the beginning of the batch) will minimize the nucleated mass, while for the L-glutamic acid process the plot is convex, indicating that a late growth trajectory will minimize the nucleated mass. These results are also supported by rigorous simulation and optimization.

Early detection of such faults is also critical for the safety of the equipment, operating personnel, and other resources. When a fault occurs in a system, it can propagate and affect several process variables. Variables that need to be measured in order to detect and diagnose the faults have to be identified and chosen economically. An algorithmic approach for identifying the optimal number, type, and location of the sensors for fault detection and diagnosis is useful, particularly for large-scale, chemical process plants. In this work, previous algorithms for sensor placement that use signed directed graph (SDG) models for the process are enhanced to include magnitude ratio (MR) information to identify more promising sensor locations. Further, we also study the combination of fault evolution sequences (FES) already introduced in the literature and the MR information for effective fault diagnosis. This is achieved by including the idea of artificial sensors that represent pairwise sensors from the original list of possible sensors. Based on the MR and FES, the artificial sensors can assume discrete values, much like the SDG approach. A symmetric difference operator is used on both the original sensors (whose behaviors are modeled as before using SDG) and the artificial sensors to identify sensor placements. This approach elegantly incorporates the new MR and FES information in the original well-accepted SDG based sensor placement algorithms. Several case studies are presented to demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed approach.

Robust Algorithms for Simultaneous Model Identification and Optimization in the Presence of Model-Plant Mismatch	INDUSTRIAL & ENGINEERING CHEMISTRY RESEARCH			English	Article							REAL-TIME OPTIMIZATION; PENICILLIN PRODUCTION; STRATEGIES	In the presence of model-plant mismatch, the set of parameter estimates obtained using standard model identification procedures cannot accurately predict the gradients of the optimization problem. Hence, a "two-step" approach involving an identification followed by an optimization step, performed repeatedly, often fails to converge to the true process optimum. In our recent work,(1) we proposed a new identification procedure that progressively corrects the model for structural error such that the updated set of parameter estimates simultaneously satisfies both identification and optimization objectives with a guaranteed convergence to the true optimum. In this paper, we expanded our previous methodology in two directions: first, a new model correction based on a higher order approximation of model is proposed, and second, the effect of model uncertainties is considered explicitly by formulating a robust optimization problem at each iteration. The resulting improvements are then illustrated using a simulated study of fed-batch penicillin production process.

Therefore, this work looks at the incorporation of a detailed reverse osmosis network (RON) superstructure within a water network superstructure in order to simultaneously minimize water, energy, operation, and capital costs. The water network consists of water sources, water sinks, and RO units for the partial treatment of the contaminated water. An overall mixed-integer nonlinear programming framework is developed that simultaneously evaluates both water recycle reuse and regeneration reuse recycle opportunities. The solution obtained from optimization provides the optimal connections between various units in the network arrangement, size and types of RO units, booster pumps, as well as energy recovery turbines. The paper looks at four cases to highlight the importance of including a detailed regeneration network within the water network instead of the traditional "black-box" model. The importance of using a variable removal ratio in the model is also highlighted by applying the work to a literature case study which leads to a 28% reduction in freshwater consumption and 80% reduction in wastewater generation.

J	Gupta, R; Kaistha, N				Gupta, Rishabh; Kaistha, Nitin			Role of Nonlinear Effects in Benzene-Toluene-Xylene Dividing Wall Column Control System Design	INDUSTRIAL & ENGINEERING CHEMISTRY RESEARCH			English	Article							REACTIVE DISTILLATION COLUMN; OPERATION; MULTIPLICITY; MIXTURES	Steady-state bifurcation analysis is applied to a ternary-benzene-toluene xylene (BTX) dividing wall column (DWC) to synthesize robust temperature inferential controlled variables (CVs). The coupling between the prefractionator and the main column causes steady-state multiplicity in conventional tray temperature CV loops. Using physical insights into the DWC behavior, differential tray temperature across the side-draw and double differential temperature control across the prefractionator rectification section are shown to significantly mitigate the steady-state multiplicity. Control system variants (with and without prefractionator liquid split manipulation) with alternative temperature-based CVs exhibit nonlinear dynamic phenomena of seeking an infeasible temperature/purity set point and input multiplicity induced "wrong" control action leading to a low purity steady-state transition under closed loop operation. These nonlinear dynamic phenomena correlate with the bifurcation analysis results. The recommended control structure with robust temperature inferential CVs is shown to effectively reject very large feed composition changes, including for on-target product purity operation via temperature inferential CV update. The work brings out the importance of robust CV design for effective control of the highly coupled and nonlinear ternary DWC process.

Targeted Removal of Dissolved Organic Matter in Boiler-Blowdown Wastewater: Integrated Membrane Filtration for Produced Water Reuse	INDUSTRIAL & ENGINEERING CHEMISTRY RESEARCH			English	Article							ASSISTED GRAVITY-DRAINAGE; OIL SANDS; COAGULATION; REJECTION; NANOFILTRATION; PERFORMANCE; EXTRACTION; SOLUTES; NOM	The efficacy of coagulation and membrane filtration was studied for the treatment of boiler-blowdown (BBD) wastewater to enable reuse and minimize the overall water consumption in steam-assisted-gravity-drainage (SAGD), thermally enhanced, oil recovery operations. Direct nanofiltration of chemically unadjusted BBD at its original pH was the optimal treatment option with respect to the flux stability and the removal of dissolved organic material and salinity, which if not removed would result in the fouling and failure of downstream process equipment. The naturally high solute hydrophilicity allowed for prolonged operation with an elevated flux of 60 L m(-2) h(-1) (LMH) and recovery up to 85% while maintaining solute removal as high as 80% and 45% for dissolved organic carbon and total dissolved solids, respectively. Comparatively, neither precoagulation nor preacidification improved the rejection of dissolved organic material or salinity and consistently resulted in increased membrane surface fouling and flux decline. The proposed filtration treatment solution would result inasmuch as a 4-fold reduction in the volume of makeup water required and BBD wastewater disposed compared to a conventional SAGD facility.

The results showed that the submicrometer composite materials with sup erhydrophobicity, superoleophilicity and good magnetic response, which had a significant effect on oil absorption and was used to absorb different oils up to 11.51 times of its own weight. More importantly, the oil-absorbed material could be recycled in the auxiliary magnetic field and still exhibited an excellent performance after the 20th cycle. With a combination of simple synthesis process, magnetic responsivity, and excellent hydrophobicity, the modified magnetic porous silica submicropartides have broad application prospects as a promising absorbent.

Its prominent green character (i.e., no catalyst or a solvent employed, biocompatible polymer precursor) renders this class of functional polymers highly competitive in terms of low environmental impact compared to commercial biosorbents. Different cross-linking protocols are implemented for the four polymer resins, all involving formation of imine and/or pyrrolic bridges between the macromolecules. Functional thermosets bearing piperazine (X-PICPip), primary amine (X-PICDap) or glycine-type (X-PKLys) functional groups are synthesized. Qualitative correlation has been attempted with the metal ion-functional group interaction evaluation through FT-IR measurements and the correspondent uptake performances. During batch studies, the three resins indicated a robust uptake of Ni(II), Ag(I), and Cr(III), whereas in competitive adsorption during selectivity studies they showed a different reactivity pattern in the presence of the same metal ions.

In this paper, a foam stabilized by partially hydrophobic modified SiO2 nanopartides and sodium dodecyl benzenesulfonate (SDBS) was studied as a fracturing fluid. The properties of SiO2/SDBS foam such as rheology, proppant suspension, filtration, and core damage were investigated. The experimental data showed that the stability and thermal adaptability of sodium dodecyl benzenesulfonate (SDBS) foam increased when silica (SiO2) nanopartides were added. The surface tension of SDBS dispersion almost did not change after SiO2 nanopartides were added; however, the dilational viscoelasticity of the interface increased, indicating that the SiO2 nanopartides attached to the interface and formed a stronger viscoelasticity layer to resist the external disturbance. The proppant settling velocity in the SiO2/SDBS foam was found to be 2 orders of magnitude lower than that in a pure SDBS foam. The total leakoff coefficient of the SiO2/SDBS foam was found to be lower than that of an SDBS foam. Although the core damage ratio of the SiO2/SDBS foam was slightly larger than that of an SDBS foam, compared to GEL/SDBS, the core damage caused by the SiO2/SDBS foam remained at a low level. SiO2 nanoparticle-surfactant-stabilized foam is superior to a surfactant-stabilized foam and causes lower core permeability damage than a gel surfactant-stabilized foam. It is recommended for use in hydraulic fracturing, particularly for fracturing stimulation in tight and shale gas reservoirs.

The liquids considered are viscous and Newtonian. The volume of fluid method has been used for tracking the interface between the three fluids. Validation is carried out by using the experimental data reported in the literature. The validated numerical model is used to perform parametric analysis to understand the effects of bubble diameter and relevant physical properties (interfacial tension between the two liquids, viscosity ratio of the two liquids, and the density difference between the two liquids). Specifically, dependence of the retention time and retention height of the bubble on bubble size and physical properties is studied. Correlations for the retention time and retention height are proposed.	[Singh, K. K.; Bart, Hans-Joerg] TU Kaiserslautern, Chair Separat Sci & Technol, D-67663 Kaiserslautern, Germany; [Singh, K.

With the 24 groups available before the writing of this paper, such a model could be used to predict fluid phase equilibrium of systems containing hydrocarbons, permanent gases (CO2, N-2, H2S, H-2, CO, He, and Ar), mercaptans, alkenes, and water. During the process of the Carbon dioxide Capture and Storage (CCS), it is often necessary to know thermodynamic properties of mixtures containing carbon dioxide, water, hydrocarbons, and trace gases, such as nitrogen, argon, hydrogen, carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide, oxygen, or nitric oxide. Basically, except sulfur dioxide, oxygen, and nitric oxide, most components encountered in systems regarding CCS processes could be modeled with the E-PPR78 model. So in order to predict the phase behavior and estimate energetic properties (e.g., enthalpy or heat capacity changes on mixing) of such systems, the applicability range of the E-PPR78 model is extended through the addition of three new groups: "SO2," "O-2," and "NO."

Films of neat PLA, PLA/PCL blend, and PLA/PCL/LACL blends were prepared by solution casting and conditioning compression. The effects of LACL on the morphology, mechanical properties, and crystallization behaviors of the blends were investigated. The addition of LACL decreased the dimensions of the dispersed PCL domains in the ternary blends. The ultimate strain of the blend with 5% LACL was significantly improved and was accompanied by a small drop in tensile strength and modulus. Both the nonisothermal and isothermal cold crystallization of PLA were enhanced by PCL, and further improved by incorporating LACL. Polarized optical microscopy observation showed that the size of crystals decreased with the addition of PCL and LACL.

Toward this aim, a biodegradable matrix, poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA), was used to obtain foams through an eco-sustainable methodology based on high speed mixing, without the use of chemical blowing agents. Moreover, considering that good thermoregulating performance in terms of heat transfer and perspiration is required for good quality shoes, microencapsulated phase change materials (PCMs) were incorporated into PVA foams. Foam morphologies investigated by SEM reveal that PCMs are finely dispersed through the PVA matrix. Mechanical properties of foams were analyzed in terms of compression behavior and shape memory recovery, triggering the dimensional changes by both temperature and relative humidity. The thermoregulating properties confirm that the presence of microcapsules affects the heat transfer phenomenon, since part of the heat provided by the source is involved in the wax phase transition.

In this work, the capacities of 1860 potential ILs (30 anions, 62 cations) for two representative S-compounds of thiophene (TS) and dibenzothiophene (DBT) are calculated using conductor-like screening model for real solvents (COSMO-RS). The influences of cation family, cation alkyl chain length, cation symmetry, anion nature, anion alkyl chain length, and functional group on the capacity are extensively discussed and are understood from microlevel view with a-profile, a-moments, and COSMO-RS energies. It is observed that the capacity is very dependent on cation and anion structure characteristics and is in a very wide range (e.g., 10(-3)similar to 10(1) for TS, 10(-3)similar to 10(2) for DBT); the van der Waals (vdW) and hydrogen-bonding (HB) energies have significant effects on the capacity. Increasing the nonpolarity and vdW energies of cation or alkyl chain on anion, or the polarity and HB energies of anion, can favor the capacity. This work is valuable to rationally select or design the ILs for desulfurization of fuel oils.

The investigated reaction was the lipase catalyzed kinetic resolution of a racemic mixture of (R/S)-2-pentanol with ethyl butyrate. The reaction is strongly limited by the reaction equilibrium so that the reactive distillation helped to shift the equilibrium toward the product side. The enantioselectivity of the applied lipase was high with ee values >99% for 2-pentanol at conversions of 69 +/- 3%. As established in our previous work, the biocatalyst was again immobilized within a hydrophobic silica coating for structured packings. The production of the biocatalytic coating was further developed as a spray-coating method to allow reproducible coatings which also can be applied on larger surfaces. The influence of the coating on separation efficiency and pressure drop was studied as well as the stability of the coating under the required process conditions. Overall, this work demonstrates the first kinetic resolution in a reactive distillation setup with structured packings and presents the catalytic coating as an alternative structure for (bio)catalytic columns internals.

In this work, bottle-grade polyethylene terephthalate (PET), Styrofoam, and polycarbonate from compact discs (CDs) were spun into nanofibers as fine as ca. 100 nm in diameter using the electrospinning technique. The mechanical properties of the fibers were evaluated using microtensile testing. The elastic moduli ranged from 15 to 60 MPa, and displayed stiffnesses comparable or greater than fibers made from commercial polymers of equivalent molecular weight. Nanofibers were also prepared from blends of Styrofoam and recycled polycarbonate. Recycled PET fibers were tested for application in water filtration and had greater than 99% filtration efficiency of 1 mu m particles. Nanofibers from both pure and mixed waste streams are expected to have applications in myriad areas such as ultra/microfiltration, composites, and tissue engineering.

Sensitive High Absorptivity and Novel Wide-Bandgap Conjugated Polymers	INDUSTRIAL & ENGINEERING CHEMISTRY RESEARCH			English	Article							SEMICONDUCTOR ELECTRONICS; CORROSION INHIBITION; PHYSICAL-PROPERTIES; HYDROGEN-PRODUCTION; POLYACRYLONITRILE; COMPOSITES; NANOTUBES; ALUMINUM; ACID; COPOLYMERS	We report the fabrication of lightweight MWCN'Ts-g-PAN carbon fiber precursors as high absorptivity and widebandgap novel materials. The synthesis of carbon fiber precursors was performed via the grafting process of polyacrylonitrile on the surface of acid functionalized multiwalled carbon nanotubes. H-1 NMR and FTIR spectroscopic techniques revealed a successful grafting process, and the formation of MWCNTs-g-PAN fibers with the extent of stabilization (i.e., degree of conjugation) equals 3.0. Such carbon fiber precursors with 200-600 mu m thickness demonstrate excellent thermal stability with three degradation steps at 276, 413, and 850 degrees C, respectively. Carbon fiber precursors display selective high absorption UV radiation and sharp discrete energy difference at 284 nm. They demonstrate linear dependence of absorptivity (epsilon) on weight fraction of multiwalled carbon nanotubes in the carbon fiber precursors (chi(CNTs)). Large absorptivity of UV radiation occurs using chi(CNTs) (%) = 0.50 specimen due to long chain aligned nanofibril structures, whereas small absorptivity of UV radiation occurs using chi(CNTs) (%) = 8.26 specimen due to wrap-up of short length PAN chains around carbon nanotubes forming flattened and thicker nanotubes, as depicted by ESEM images. Sensitive cutoff UVB absorptions correspond to 4.36-4.38 eV, which classify carbon fiber precursors as promising wide-bandgap materials and probably adapt them to play a focal role in many future optoelectronic and/or aeronautic implementations.

In this study, the ammoniabased wet flue gas desulfurization obtained ammonia resource from urea hydrolysis instead of anhydrous ammonia and aqueous ammonia, which was beneficial for the development of circular economy. An electric-heating reactor was employed as the hydrolysis reactor instead of traditional ones using hot air or water vapor as the heat carrier. The effects of temperature, pressure, urea solution concentration, and time on urea hydrolysis were investigated, and the optimum hydrolysis condition was estimated to be 30 (wt, %) urea solution hydrolyzing for 4 h at 140 degrees C, 0.4 MPa. The desulfurization experiment was conducted in a bubbling reactor. The effects of SO2 concentration and liquid gas ratio on desulfurization were investigated. The ammonia-based absorbent for desulfurization was prepared by the ammonia produced from the 30 (wt, %) urea solution hydrolyzing for 4 h at 140 degrees C, 0.4 MPa. The experimental results showed that all desulfurization efficiencies at different SO2 concentrations exceeded 99%, and a higher liquid-gas ratio could raise the desulfurization efficiency. The suitable pH range for this ammoniabased absorbent is 6.5-7.5. It was also found that higher SO2 concentration and lower liquid gas ratio could promote the generation of high added-value ammonium sulfate.

Role of Liquid Concentration in Coke Yield from Model Vacuum Residue-Coke Agglomerates	INDUSTRIAL & ENGINEERING CHEMISTRY RESEARCH			English	Article							FLUIDIZED-BED; THERMAL-CRACKING; MASS-TRANSFER; THIN-FILMS; COKING; SPRAY; PARTICLES; INJECTION; CONTACT; BITUMEN	The fluid coking process is an example of an upgrading process that uses hot solids to heat and crack bitumen into more valuable products. When feed liquid is sprayed into a fluid bed of hot solids, the solids tend to agglomerate, giving simultaneous heating, reaction, and disintegration processes. The reaction of mixtures of three Athabasca vacuum residues and fluid coke particles was investigated by heating them in Curie point reactors in an induction furnace up to 530 degrees C. Small scale reactors with machined wells were fabricated from Curie point alloy. The yield of coke was measured as a function of the ratio of liquid to solid, heating rate, and feed type. Coke yields were insensitive to heating rates from 5 to 120 degrees C/s, at a constant final temperature. Bubbling was observed as the ratio of liquid feed in the mixture was raised above a threshold, depending on the reactivity of the feed used. Bubbling was observed to increase with greater heating rates, but it had little effect on ultimate coke yield. Coke yield increased with the fraction of bitumen on particles for all feed types tested. When the coke yields were normalized using the microcarbon residue content of the feeds, the results did not give a single trend when plotted with fraction of feed present in the mixtures.

High Efficiency Conversion of Glycerol to 1,3-Propanediol Using a Novel Platinum-Tungsten Catalyst Supported on SBA-15	INDUSTRIAL & ENGINEERING CHEMISTRY RESEARCH			English	Article							VAPOR-PHASE HYDROGENOLYSIS; SELECTIVE HYDROGENOLYSIS; MESOPOROUS SILICA; BIFUNCTIONAL CATALYSTS; RUTHENIUM CATALYSTS; ACID; DEHYDRATION; ACROLEIN; COPOLYMER; OXIDATION	The hydrogenolysis of glycerol to 1,3-propanediol was conducted over a series of Pt-WO3/SBA-15 catalysts with Pt content ranging from 0.5 to 3 wt % and W content of 10 wt % in vapor phase under atmospheric pressure for the first time. The catalysts prepared via sequential impregnation method were systematically characterized using XRD, NH3-TPD, Py-IR, CO chemisorption, TPR, TEM, and surface area measurements. The catalysts exhibited unprecedented activity for selective formation of 1,3-propanediol via hydrogenolysis of glycerol. The effect of various reaction parameters such as catalyst loading, reaction temperature, hydrogen flow rate, glycerol concentration and reaction time were studied. The optimized reaction conditions showed that a high glycerol conversion (86%) and 1,3-propanediol selectivity (42%) was obtained over 2Pt-10WO(3)/SBA-15 catalyst illustrating the potential of SBA-15 supported platinum-tungsten catalyst to be highly active and efficient. The Bronsted acid sites of the catalyst formed due to addition of WO3 enhanced selective formation of 1,3-propanediol.

The effects of the supports and cobalt loading on the performance of the catalysts were investigated. The results showed that the Co/SiO2 catalyst with 20 wt % Co loading gave the highest conversion of IPN (90.9%) and yield of IPDA (70.4 mol %) among the supported cobalt catalysts used in this work, and it could be reused eight times without a significant decrease in the catalytic performance, which was much better than that from the commercial Raney Co. Meanwhile, the possible intermediates and reaction pathways during hydroamination of IPN were provided.

In this paper, a series of Mg3Al-P2W17X (X = Mn-III, Fe-III, Zn-II, Co-II, Cu-II, Ni-II) have been prepared successfully by intercalating the polyoxometalate (POM) of [alpha(2)-P2W17O61(X center dot OH2)](n-) ([P2W17X](n-), n = 7 or 8) into a Mg3Al-suberic precursor. Catalytic tests for H2O2-based sulfoxidation of various sulfides demonstrate that Mg3Al-P2W17Zn exhibits better catalytic efficiency and selectivity than pure POM or LDH precursors under mild conditions. The uniform and well-ordered dispersion of POM in the confined gallery of LDHs and the multiple interactions between POMs and LDHs contribute to the excellent catalytic performance. Moreover, Mg3Al-P2W17Zn is stable and can be easily separated from the reaction system. The recycled Mg3Al-P2W17Zn maintains both the intact structures of the POM anion and LDHs. The scaled-up experiment provides further support for its potential use for industrial applications.

In absence of acid or base catalysis and in neutral medium, the in situ oxidation process successfully demonstrates the potential of beta-CD-CTAP complex as a green oxidant, in contrast to earlier reports on permanganate reagents. beta-CD lends a supramolecular catalysis during the reaction due to its noncovalent interaction with CTAP. Substituent effect, reaction coefficient, deuterium isotope effect, effect of beta-CD concentration, and the values of thermodynamic parameters help in proposing suitable mechanisms for the oxidation process. Proportionate variation of the rate constant values with the concentration of CTAP demonstrates the absence of any reverse micellization phenomenon of the oxidant, in contrast to earlier findings.

J	Kim, BS; Rhee, HW				Kim, Bum-Seok; Rhee, Hee-Woo			Effect of Crystallization Conditions on Spherulite Size and Melt Spinning Performance of Polyester Industrial Yarn by Solid-State Polymerization	INDUSTRIAL & ENGINEERING CHEMISTRY RESEARCH			English	Article							REACTION-KINETICS; POLY(TRIMETHYLENE TEREPHTHALATE); POLY(BUTYLENE TEREPHTHALATE); POLYETHYLENE TEREPHTHALATE; PROPERTY PARAMETERS; MOLECULAR-WEIGHT; POLYCONDENSATION; POLY(ETHYLENE-TEREPHTHALATE); BEHAVIOR; MORPHOLOGY	Polyester industrial yarn has high tenacity by increasing the degree of orientation and crystallinity via the melt spinning of high-molecular-weight (high-M-w) polymer. Solid-state polymerization (SSP) is very important to get higher M-w; it is composed of a crystallization step, which prevents sticking among the chips, and a polycondensation step at solid state. Spherulites in the chip were observed using polarized optical microscopy (POM) in the crystallization step. We studied the effect of crystallization conditions on spherulite size by SSP and determined that the higher the crystallization temperature, the larger the size and deviation of the spherulite. We also observed relatively uniform sizes in the batch process but various sizes in the continuous process. The latter difference in the size and shape of the spherulite would cause differences in the diffusivity of both the end-group and the byproduct, thus resulting in large deviations in M-w and viscosity. Thus, when the crystallization temperature in the continuous process was reduced by 15 degrees C to decrease the differences of thermal and physical impact history among chips, the sizes and shapes of spherulites consequently became uniform and the difference of M-w decreased because of the reduced crystallization rate difference among chips by decreased temperature deviation in the crystallization reactor. We could get more uniform polymer with reduced variations of M-w, intrinsic viscosity (IV), and melt viscosity (MV). Finally, the max draw ratio, which represents the drawability in melt spinning, increased from 6.28 to 6.71.

J	Reis, MS; Rendall, R; Chin, ST; Chiang, L				Reis, Marco S.; Rendall, Ricardo; Chin, Swee-Teng; Chiang, Leo			Challenges in the Specification and Integration of Measurement Uncertainty in the Development of Data-Driven Models for the Chemical Processing Industry	INDUSTRIAL & ENGINEERING CHEMISTRY RESEARCH			English	Article							LEAST-SQUARES REGRESSION; PRINCIPAL COMPONENT ANALYSIS; HETEROSCEDASTIC MEASUREMENT NOISE; LINEAR-REGRESSION; MEASUREMENT ERRORS; MISSING DATA; CALIBRATION; PLS; ALGORITHMS; MATRICES	Obtaining and handling measurement uncertainty information is still a challenge in the chemical processing industries (CPI). From our experience, among the variables most affected by uncertainty, one typically finds the process outputs, comprising concentrations (main product and subproducts, reactants, etc.), measurements of quality properties (mechanical, chemical, etc.), or other relevant information about the end use of the product. With the increasing flexibility of processing units, these quantities can easily span different orders of magnitude and present rather different uncertainties associated with their measurements. This means that heteroscedasticity in the process outputs is a rather prevalent feature in CPI, which must be properly managed and integrated in all the tasks that make use of process data. In this article we address this critical problem, by considering two challenges: (i) specifying measurement uncertainty in heteroscedastic contexts; (ii) integrating uncertainty information on the outputs in model development. We present a critical review of the relevant literature regarding both challenges, and we address them through industrial case studies as well as an extensive Monte Carlo simulation study. For the first challenge, we provide solutions to handle the problem of specifying measurement uncertainties near physical limits (namely at very low concentrations, where intervals can easily include negative concentrations) and how to develop uncertainty models for heteroscedastic measurement devices spanning several orders of magnitude of the measurand. Regarding the second challenge, we conclude that prediction performance can be significantly improved by replacing tacitly homoscedastic modeling methodologies (ordinary least squares, partial least squares, and principal components regression) by alternative approaches that are able to explicitly handle the uncertainty in the outputs. Several important aspects of model development under heteroscedastic noisy conditions in the outputs are also highlighted and discussed.

Real-time optimization strategies are developed and implemented to deal with the variability in renewable resources and electricity pricing. The heat-exchanger superstructure is first defined, and the transitions between the constituent HEN substructures are assumed to be instantaneous. The optimal configurations are then sent to the local controllers as structural set-points to be implemented. The explicit nonlinear models of heat-exchangers built in Aspen Plus are utilized to describe the dynamic behavior of the HEN, and closed-loop simulations are used to demonstrate the real-time reconfiguration process. A HEN with two hot and two cold streams, coupled with solar and wind energy resources, is used as a case study to exemplify the power cogeneration.

Integrated Operational and Financial Hedging for Risk Management in Crude Oil Procurement	INDUSTRIAL & ENGINEERING CHEMISTRY RESEARCH			English	Article							REFINERY OPERATIONS; PRICING POLICIES; BATCH PLANTS; SUPPLY CHAIN; OPTIMIZATION; UNCERTAINTY; MODELS; INVENTORY; CONTRACT	This Article presents a general framework for the integration of operational hedging and financial hedging strategy in the crude oil procurement process. The main purpose of the proposed approach is to manage the risk in the oil procurement process due to oil price fluctuation. The problem is formulated as a one-stage stochastic programming model that incorporates Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) as the risk measure. By introducing production flexibility such as inventory and the nonlinear CDU Fractionation Index (FI) model, as well as financial derivatives like futures, put option, and call option, the integrated hedging strategy enables industrial managers to obtain the desired balance between profitability and risk tolerance. In addition, a Sample Average Approximation (SAA) method is applied to solve the stochastic problem. Numerical studies illustrate the benefits of the proposed approach and also provide useful managerial insights.

The Hardy Cross method is modified to handle the nonisothermal and compressible flow of high pressure steam in the looped pipeline network. Steam conditions taken into account include the flow pattern, the pressure, and temperature profiles. The amount of condensate generated in pipeline sections in the looped network is calculated with high precision. The movement of possible stagnant points, pipe sections where steam flow rate is significantly small, is also identified. Scenario-based analyses indicate that steam temperature drop is significant in those sections with stagnant points. An oil refinery can benefit greatly from using the proposed analysis to optimize operation of a high pressure steam distribution network.

Although there are many commercial ways to obtain hydrogen sulfide, the need to reach very low concentration values, at the ppm or even at the ppb level, is the main motivation behind this work. This work examines the production and utilization of a new, low H2S breakthrough and high capacity adsorbent, made of iron nanopartides embedded in carbon nanofilaments. It is produced by a 2-step functionalization methodology: acid pretreatment and iron wet impregnation. This novel adsorbent was characterized by scanning transmission electron microscope, X-ray absorption near edge structure, Brunauer Emmet and Teller calculations, and thermogravimetric analysis, and the adsorption efficiency was measured for different iron-loadings, temperatures, and H2S breakthrough values. Operating conditions and metal-loading that allow a decrease of H2S concentration from 500 ppm to below 1.5 ppm are reported. It has also been found that acid treatment influences metal dispersion and, due to the nanometric nature of adsorbents, the process is not controlled by mass diffusion phenomena.

Adsorption measurement and X-ray diffraciton analysis indicated that their interactions with Ca-montmorillonite originated from electrostatic attractions between carboxylate groups and the positive charge of Ca-montmorillonite particle. Compared with conventional polycarboxylate superplasticizers (PCEs) only with poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) chains, polycarboxylate superplasticizers with beta-CD as pendants displayed enhanced robustness toward clay. This was attributed to the steric hindrance instigated from beta-CD groups with the structure of a hollow truncated cone by hindering the sorption of polycarboxylate polymers on the surfaces of Ca-montmorillonite.

Results showed that CMS has a larger NOx adsorption amount and lower desorption temperature in NOx temperature programmed desorption (TPD) process. The addition of Cu benefits the NOx adsorption and nonthermal plasmas (NTP) removal capacity, and the NOx removal capacity and the ratio of NTP/(NTP + TPD) achieved 96.2% and 68.39% over 15%Cu-CMS in 30 min. Water vapor has an obvious effect on the NOx adsorption and discharge plasma catalytic process. In cyclic operation, 15%Cu-CMS has a better NOx adsorption-discharge property. The Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) method showed the average pore width, surface area, and pore volume of the sample after cyclic operation has no significant change. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) showed a new lattice oxygen peak appeared in O is spectra, and the Cu2O peak disappeared in Cu 2p spectra after cyclic operation.

The activity of modified catalysts had a significant improvement as follows: Mn-Co-KOH > Mn-Co-K2CO3 > Mn-Co-KNO3, which was in good agreement with the order of alkalinity. NH3/CO2-TPD results indicated that potassium-precursor promoters could regulate the acid-basic and adsorption property of catalyst through the neutralization and intervention of K+/basic groups. The XRD, XPS, and NO-TPD results showed that the potassium precursor enhanced the dispersion, the ratios of Mn4+/Mn3+ and Co2+/Co3+ to some extent, especially for the chemisorbed oxygen and adsorption performance of NO. The main reasons of improvement may be attributed to the enhancement of NO adsorption performance and the synergetic effect between Co and Mn ions. Finally, the possible reaction mechanisms are proposed.

It helps the planner to reduce the number of pump and segment switches between active and idle conditions to obtain savings on pump operating and maintenance costs. Most contributions on the detailed scheduling of multiproduct pipelines concern networks with a single straight line. Large-scale pipeline networks, however, usually have a treelike configuration, featuring a mainline and several secondary lines, transporting smaller volumes of refined petroleum products over shorter distances. This work addresses the scheduling of a multiproduct treelike pipeline through a continuous-time mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model that allows the execution of simultaneous deliveries from a unique refinery to multiple downstream terminals so as to get a substantial increase in transportation capacity. Contrary to previous contributions on treelike pipeline systems, the new model solves batch sizing and sequencing problems in a single step, generating a detailed delivery schedule. It also handles flow rate limitations in downstream pipeline segments originated from a lower diameter. Three case studies including one real life problem are used to illustrate the efficacy of the proposed model.

To meet the demand for higher profit and energy utilization, it is imperative to integrate the two systems for refinery-wide simultaneous optimization, although the integrated model results in a mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem in which the bilinear terms for the correlation of the blending process and gas emission directly result in inconsistency between solution quality and time. The main aim of this work is to propose a solution strategy based on heuristics to decompose the integrated model of the two systems into a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model and a nonlinear programming (NLP) model which are then solved iteratively through variables transferring to further reduce the solution time. The solution of the traditional sequential method is incorporated to generate better initial estimates for the decomposed model to gain better solution quality and efficiency. The proposed solution approach is compared with the basic sequential method and the standard MINLP solvers. The results obtained in two scenarios of a case study from a real refinery demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed decomposition strategy.

Previous work with propane focused on vertical jet fires. In this work, both horizontal and vertical fires were studied through 21 tests conducted at the Brayton Fire Training Field. The fires were sustained by either vapor or liquid propane. The visualization of flames using both video and infrared cameras identified that cylindrical shape was a good description of vertical and horizontal jet fires. For the vertical fires, a correlation was developed for radiation against distance from the flame axis. For horizontal fires, the solid flame model was used to predict radiation; the selected parameters were evaluated by statistical performance measures. The effects of vapor flow rate, surface emissive power, and the fraction of radiation were also studied.	[Zhang, Bin; Liu, Yi; Laboureur, Delphine; Mannan, M.

Hydrodynamics and Morphologies of Droplet Coalescence	INDUSTRIAL & ENGINEERING CHEMISTRY RESEARCH			English	Article							LIQUID INTERFACES; SURFACE-TENSION; DYNAMICS; COLLAPSE	By the combination of high-speed imaging and numerical simulation, we explore the hydrodynamics and possible morphologies of the entire coalescence of a pendent droplet and sessile one. We identify three types of coalescence morphologies and plot a corresponding phase diagram to identify them depending on the Bond number and the size ratio between the two droplets. In addition to the well-known linear inertial growth of the liquid bridge at the initial contact of the two drops, we observe a new subsequent slower linear expansion of the liquid bridge and provide a linear scaling law with a measured prefactor to quantitatively represent it. This new growth is found to be due to the transition of the capillary force produced by a change in the azimuthal surface profile of the liquid bridge.

Selecting a Differential Equation Cell Cycle Model for Simulating Leukemia Treatment	INDUSTRIAL & ENGINEERING CHEMISTRY RESEARCH			English	Article							ACUTE MYELOID-LEUKEMIA; CANCER-CHEMOTHERAPY; MECHANISMS; FRAMEWORK; DELIVERY; TOOL	This work studies three differential equation models of the leukemia cell cycle: a population balance model (PBM) using intracellular protein expression levels as state variables representing phase progress; a delay differential equation model (DDE) with temporal phase durations as delays; and an ordinary differential equation model (ODE) of phase-to-phase progression. In each type of model, global sensitivity analysis determines the most significant parameters while parameter estimation fits experimental data. To compare models based on the output of their structural properties, an expected behavior was defined, and each model was coupled to a pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic model of chemotherapy delivery. Results suggest that the particular cell cycle model chosen highly affects the simulated treatment outcome, given the same steady state kinetic parameters and drug dosage/scheduling. The manuscript shows how cell cycle models should be selected according to the complexity, sensitivity, and parameter availability of the application envisioned.

The effect of steam on the reactivity of the MgO sorbents was investigated experimentally. The results indicate that the presence of steam significantly improves the overall rate of the carbonation reaction through two different mechanisms. The presence of steam improves the intrinsic rate of the carbonation reaction by altering the carbonation reaction pathway through the formation of more reactive transient MgO center dot H2O/Mg(OH)(2)(center dot) intermediate compounds. The formation of the transient intermediate compounds with larger molar volume (compared with MgO) results in the expansion of the inner pores, which lowers diffusion resistance to the reactant gas (i.e., CO2) during carbonation.

The coprecipitation of catalyst precursors in MISR was conducted under precisely controlled concentration, pH and volumetric flow rate (V-A), followed by the conventional postprecipitation steps. TEM images showed that the coprecipitation in MISR would generate mostly round catalyst particles with a mean size of 8-10 nm; whereas slightly larger and irregular particles were produced in conventional batch route. In addition, the CuO/ZnO/Al2O3 catalysts prepared in MISR possessed larger BET surface area (S-BET), specific copper surface area (S-Cu) and pore volume as well as better Cu/Zn dispersion when compared to those produced in batch route. It was also found that during the preparation of CuO/ZnO/Al2O3 catalysts in MISR, the reactant concentration (C-mn) and volumetric flow rates (V-A) had great influences on the structures and properties of the precursors and the final catalysts. The catalytic performance evaluation by CO hydrogenation to methanol showed that both the catalytic activity and selectivity of CuO/ZnO/Al2O3 catalysts prepared in MISR were superior to those produced in batch route.

J	Zhang, C; Wang, C; Zhang, SJ; Guo, LJ				Zhang, Chao; Wang, Chao; Zhang, Shaojun; Guo, Liejin			Experimental and Numerical Studies on a One-Step Method for the Production of Mg in the Silicothermic Reduction Process	INDUSTRIAL & ENGINEERING CHEMISTRY RESEARCH			English	Article							THERMAL HALF DECOMPOSITION; CALCINED DOLOMITE; PIDGEON PROCESS; MAGNESIUM PRODUCTION; METALLURGICAL PROCESSES; KINETIC-ANALYSIS; HIGH-TEMPERATURE; HEAT-TRANSFER; CO2 G; CALCINATION	In this paper, a new efficient one-step technical method was first developed for the production of magnesium in the industry. The one-step method could combine the two processes of dolomite decomposition and magnesium reduction in the magnesium reduction retort. Thus, the high-temperature carbon dioxide produced by the dolomite decomposition process could be collected in a timely manner instead of being emitted into the atmosphere, and excessive heat loss caused by the two separate processes also could be almost completely avoided. This paper presents an experimental study on the intrinsic chemical kinetics mechanisms of this new efficient one-step technology. By applying each of the most likely solid-state kinetic models, the kinetic parameters of the two reactions that reacted during the dolomite decomposition stage and magnesium reduction stage were evaluated, and the kinetic models that best verify the experimental data were attempted. For the dolomite decomposition stage of the one-step technology, the equation of the chemical kinetic model can be represented by alpha(2)/2 = k(D1)tau in the temperature range of 1173-1473 K, and the apparent activation energy was determined to be 160.6 kJ mol(-1). For the magnesium reduction stage of the one-step technology, the surface reaction chemical kinetic model 1 - (1 - beta)(1/3) = k(s)tau described very satisfactorily the experimental values for the different reduction temperature. Then, a one-step model incorporating the chemical reaction kinetics of the dolomite decomposition stage and the magnesium reduction stage and heat conduction was first developed. The simulations of the impact of heating temperature on the dolomite decomposition stage and magnesium reduction stage were carried out in the reduction retorts of the furnace utilizing this model. The distribution of dolomite decomposition extent in the retorts, the total extent of dolomite decomposition with time, the distribution of magnesium reduction extent in the retorts, and the total extent of magnesium reduction with time were studied in detail. The analysis showed that the one-step technology is effective in not only reducing the cycle time of dolomite decomposition stage and magnesium reduction stage but also saving energy.

Moreover, the influence of catalyst calcination temperature to the above reaction was also studied. The reaction parameters, including reaction temperature, catalyst dose, and molar ratio of m-xylene to benzoyl chloride, were optimized, and a 95.1% yield of 2,4-dimethylbenzophenone was obtained under optimal conditions.

Portlandite carbonation is noted to be rapid; e.g., >80% carbonation of Ca(OH)(2) is achieved in 2 h upon contact with liquid CO2 at ambient temperatures, and it is only slightly sensitive to the effects of temperature, pressure, and the state of CO2 over the range of 6 MPa <= p <= 10 MPa and 8 C <= T <= 42 degrees C. Additional studies suggest that the carbonation of anhydrous ordinary portland cement is slower and far less reliable than that of portlandite. Although cementation is not directly assessed, detailed scanning electron microscopy (SEM) examinations of carbonated microstructures indicate that the carbonation products formed encircle and embed sand grains similar to that observed in lime mortars. The outcomes suggest innovative directions for "carbon-neutral cementation."

In this work, carbon conversion is studied by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and a packed-bed reactor. The key influence parameters including nickel-loading amount and gasification temperature were investigated. In the absence of nickel, the carbon conversion efficiency of 100% was achieved in 40 min at 1000 degrees C, whereas this time was extended to 130 min at 700 degrees C. Although the use of high temperatures improved char reactivity, relatively high temperatures can shift the reaction rate toward the pore-diffusion-controlled regime. Also, the addition of nickel catalyst can improve the biochar reactivity by reducing the activation energy, in terms of the improvement of the carbon conversion and its rate. In the view of RHA Ni recycling, the silica-based nickel nanoparticles could be recycled in various catalytic applications.

CaO Nanoparticles Coated by ZrO2 Layers for Enhanced CO2 Capture Stability	INDUSTRIAL & ENGINEERING CHEMISTRY RESEARCH			English	Article							HYDROGEN-PRODUCTION; PHASE-TRANSFORMATION; CARBON-DIOXIDE; RAMAN-SPECTRA; SORPTION; SORBENTS; PERFORMANCE; DEPOSITION; EFFICIENCY; ABSORBENT	CaO is an attractive CO2 acceptor, due to its good kinetics and high capture capacity, even under low CO2 concentration conditions. The major problem associated with CaO acceptors is the loss of CO2 capture capacity during cyclic operations. The declining performance of the CaO acceptors is more pronounced in the presence of steam. In this article we propose a method for fabrication of nano-CaO acceptors coated with a ZrO, layer to improve the stability. The nano-CaO acceptor was prepared by a thermal decomposition method following coating by a sol gel, incipient wet impregnation, or hydrolysis process. Thermogravimetric analysis of the cyclic process of CO, carbonation/decarbonation revealed that the nano-CaO acceptors with sol gel (CaO-SG) and wet impregnation (CaO-IM) coatings have higher CO2 capture capacity and longer lifetime than the uncoated ones. The capture capacity of CaO-IM declined after 14 cycles, whereas CaO-SG remained stable up to 20 cycles. X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, and Raman spectroscopy were used to characterize the coated and uncoated nano-CaO structures. Combined characterization techniques showed that a CaZrO3 layer was formed around the nano-CaO particles by sol gel coating. Multicycle carbonation/decarbonation processes were performed in the absence and in the presence of steam in CO2 capture kinetics experiments as well as under the sorption-enhanced reforming conditions, and CaO nanoparticles with a surface CaZrO3 layer showed promising cyclic stability.

The cross sections of the as-prepared hybrid films resemble the brick-and-mortar structure of nacre. The tensile strength of the Au NPs-LDH-PVA hybrid film reaches a high value of 122 MPa, which is higher than that of a pure PVA film and surpasses the strength of natural nacre. Furthermore, we demonstrate that Au NPs-LDH-PVA hybrid films possess surface-enhanced Raman scattering and catalytic properties. Therefore, our report on the fabrication of multifunctional Au NPs-LDH-PVA hybrid films not only shows a feasible route to functionalizing artificial nacre-inspired materials but also potentially broadens applications of these nacre-like materials.

Effect of Ethanolamine, Ammonia, Acetic Acid, and Formic Acid on Two-Phase Flow Accelerated Corrosion in Steam-Water Cycles	INDUSTRIAL & ENGINEERING CHEMISTRY RESEARCH			English	Article								Effects of ethanolamine, ammonia, and acetic and formic acid on two-phase flow-accelerated corrosion were investigated in an experimental loop simulating the conditions found in a water-steam cycle. Results indicate that the effects of acetic acid and ethanolamine on the corrosion rate neutralize each other. The effect of acetic acid on the corrosion rate was most pronounced at the highest tested steam quality. A model simulation for liquid film pH at 90% steam quality suggests that at very high steam qualities the protection ethanolamine provides increases, while the protection provided by ammonia goes down. A linear relation between calculated liquid film pH and the measured corrosion rate was found for 24% steam quality within a pH range from 5.6 to 6.3. Formic acid was thermally unstable at the tested temperatures and had no effect on the corrosion rate.	[Moed, D. H.; Rietveld, L.

J	Liu, XC; Hirajima, T; Nonaka, M; Sasaki, K				Liu, Xiangchun; Hirajima, Tsuyoshi; Nonaka, Moriyasu; Sasaki, Keiko			Investigation of the Changes in Hydrogen Bonds During Low-Temperature Pyrolysis of Lignite by Diffuse Reflectance FT-IR Combined with Forms of Water	INDUSTRIAL & ENGINEERING CHEMISTRY RESEARCH			English	Article							CHEMICAL-STRUCTURE CHANGES; LOW-RANK COALS; CHINESE LIGNITE; AIR; NITROGEN; BEHAVIOR; SYSTEM	The changes in the hydrogen bonds (HBs) of Loy Yang lignite during low-temperature pyrolysis were investigated. The water content of all of the samples was determined by weighing the samples before and after heating in an oven. The changes in the number of the different types of HBs were determined using diffuse reflectance Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy considering the forms of water in lignite. The number of absorption bands, their peak positions, and the area of each peak in each spectrum were determined by curve-fitting analysis with the mixed Gaussian and Lorentzian function. The quantified integrated area of aromatic hydrogen atoms was used to accurately investigate the changes in the HBs. The results showed that the freezable and nonfreezable water contents of the total water weight in raw lignite were 84.8% and 15.2%, respectively. At low temperatures (T <= 100 degrees C), the main removed water was freezable water. The number of OH-lignite interactions decreased compared with raw lignite, which can be attributed to the breaking of bound-water-cluster-lignite HBs. The removal of free water induced a decrease in the number of OH-OH interactions, and then the transition of free water to bound water increased the number of OH-OH interactions. At medium temperatures (100 < T < 200 degrees C), bound and nonfreezable water were mainly removed. The number of OH-lignite and OH-OH interactions changed because of the competition between the transition of bound water to nonfreezable water and desorption of bound and nonfreezable water. At higher temperatures (200 < T <= 250 degrees C), nonfreezable water was the main form of water removed, and carboxyl groups started to drastically pyrolyze. OH-lignite interactions changed as a result of the removal of nonfreezable water and the pyrolysis of carboxyl groups.

In this work, by replacing the conventional binary variable in a HENS model, a nonlinear approximation term is developed to indicate the existence of a heat exchanger so as to reduce the amount of variables and constraint as well as enhance the model's computational efficiency. With this approximation, a new HENS model was formulated considering simultaneously nonisothermal mixing and temperature-dependent heat capacity flow rate. All the variables of the model are stated with clear upper and lower bounds. A 10-stream (5 hot process streams and 5 cold process streams) benchmark HENS problem is solved by the developed model. The results show that the proposed model can generate a better cost-optimal heat exchanger network (HEN) with more accurate configuration in relatively short solution time compared with that in the literature.

An aqueous biphasic system (ABS) consisting of the nonfluorinated carboxyl-functionalized phosphonium IL [P444C1COOH]Cl and a 16 wt % NaCl solution is described. The IL-rich phase of the aqueous biphasic system has a very low viscosity, in comparison to the pure IL [P444C1COOH]Cl. This system has excellent extraction properties for scandium. Different extraction parameters were investigated, including contact time and metal loading. The influence of the pH on the solubility of the IL cation in the water-rich phase was determined via quantitative. H-1 NMR. The stripping of scandium with oxalic acid from the IL phase was also investigated. A plausible extraction mechanism is proposed where three IL cations are deprotonated to form zwitterionic compounds that can coordinate scandium(III) ions.

Microimaging of Transient Intracrystalline Concentration Profiles during Two-Component Uptake of Light Hydrocarbon-Carbon Dioxide Mixtures by DDR-Type Zeolites	INDUSTRIAL & ENGINEERING CHEMISTRY RESEARCH			English	Article							METAL-ORGANIC FRAMEWORK; INTERFERENCE MICROSCOPY; NANOPOROUS MATERIALS; DD3R ZEOLITE; DIFFUSION; ADSORPTION; TRANSPORT; METHANOL; SYSTEMS; FERRIERITE	We report here the application of interference microscopy to study intracrystalline diffusion in a binary adsorbed phase. Hitherto the application of interference microscopy to the study of intracrystalline diffusion has been limited to single-component systems since only for a single-component system is the measured phase shift directly related to the concentration. However, when the difference in diffusivity between the components is sufficiently large, the faster component reaches equilibrium on a time scale that is short compared with the diffusion time for the slower component. Under these conditions, which are fulfilled for the system studied (CO2-C2H6 in a large crystal of zeolite DDR), it is possible to determine the transient concentration profiles for both components and hence to determine the influence of the fast component on diffusion of the slower species. It is shown that measurements of this type offer a possible approach for experimental determination of the diffusion matrix. For the system studied, diffusion of ethane was found to be essentially unaffected by the presence of CO2, in conformity with the results of an earlier study carried out by the zero length column technique.

However, most of the existing models for ILs assume either full dissociation or full nondissociation regardless of mixture compositions. In this work, the dissociation of ILs (CA = C+ + A(-)) is described as a chemical reaction. Together with the predictive COSMO-SAC model, the dissociation constant can be determined based on the value of a in the pure state. Our results show that the predicted composition dependence of a is in good agreement with experiment over the entire concentration range. We further examine the prediction of a variety of thermodynamic properties and phase behaviors of IL solutions, covering high (infinite dilution activity coefficient of solvent), medium (vapor-liquid and liquid-liquid), and low (osmotic coefficient and mean ionic activity coefficient) IL concentrations (a total of 9857 data points). Our results show that the composition dependence of IL dissociation has a significant impact on the phase behaviors of IL solutions. The dominating factors for the solution nonideality changes from short-range ion-pair interactions at high IL concentrations to long-range ion ion interactions at low IL concentrations.

The derived properties such as excess volumes (V-E), deviation in isentropic compressibilities (Delta kappa(s)) deviation in viscosities (Delta eta), and deviation in refractive indices (Delta n(D)) under the same experimental conditions for these systems were also estimated. The observed V-E and Delta kappa(s) values are negative over the entire composition of ILs at all investigated temperatures, whereas Delta eta and Delta n(D) values are positive under the same experimental conditions. These results reveal that the ammonium-based ILs significantly affect the intermolecular interactions between the solvent molecules. The computational study allows a qualitative analysis of the results in terms of the ion dipole interactions, ion-pair formation, and hydrogen bonding between ammonium-based ILs and water.

Calculating the Fugacity of Pure, Low Volatile Liquids via Molecular Simulation with Application to Acetanilide, Acetaminophen, and Phenacetin	INDUSTRIAL & ENGINEERING CHEMISTRY RESEARCH			English	Article							UNITED-ATOM DESCRIPTION; MONTE-CARLO-SIMULATION; EXPLICIT-HYDROGEN DESCRIPTION; FREE-ENERGY CALCULATIONS; SOLVATION FREE-ENERGIES; VAPOR SATURATION PROPERTIES; LINEAR CONSTRAINT SOLVER; KNUDSEN EFFUSION METHOD; TEST PARTICLE METHOD; SIDE-CHAIN ANALOGS	Conventional molecular simulation free energy calculations and standard thermodynamic relations are applied to compute the pure liquid fugacity of low volatile liquids and compared to reference Monte Carlo simulations. The method involves the calculation of the residual chemical potential and the molar volume of the liquid at the conditions of interest. For substances that are solid at the conditions of interest, simulations may be performed at elevated temperatures and extrapolated to subcooled conditions. It is shown that direct calculations at subcooled conditions provide erroneous values of the fugacity. Knowledge of the pure liquid fugacity is essential to compute activity coefficients defined with respect to a Lewis-Randall standard state for thermodynamic property modeling. The validity of the method is verified by comparing to reference simulation results for n-octane, 3,4-dimethylhexane, cyclohexane, methanol, 1-propanol, and 2-propanol. The method is then applied to acetanilide, acetaminophen, and phenacetin, all of which are solid at ambient conditions. The results for the six reference compounds are in good agreement with standard Monte Carlo simulations, suggesting that free energy based calculations of the fugacity may be used to accurately normalize activity coefficients of low volatile liquids computed via molecular simulation.

Concentration-dependent H-1 NMR chemical shifts of ethyl acetate + ethanol + [Bmim]BF4 or [Bmmim]BF4 (x(IL) = 0.1 and 0.3) systems show that the interaction between [Bmim]BF4 and ethanol is much stronger than that between [Bmmim]BF4 and ethanol. Moreover, the experimental and predicted VLE demonstrate that the improvement of relative volatility of ethyl acetate to ethanol by [Bmim]BF4 is better than that by [Bmmim]BF4. Also, sigma-profile obtained from COSMO-RS method indicates that the hydrogen bonding donator ability of [Bmim](+) is greater than that of [Bmmim](+). Therefore, it can be deduced that the acidic C2-H plays an important role in the interaction differentiation of the ionic liquids and their effect on the VLE of the ethyl acetate + ethanol system, resulting from the interaction of the acidic C2-H with the ethanol that is much stronger than with the ethyl acetate.

J	Abolhasani, M; Kumacheva, E; Gunther, A				Abolhasani, Milad; Kumacheva, Eugenia; Guenther, Axel			Peclet Number Dependence of Mass Transfer in Microscale Segmented Gas-Liquid Flow	INDUSTRIAL & ENGINEERING CHEMISTRY RESEARCH			English	Article							CARBON-DIOXIDE; MICROFLUIDIC SYNTHESIS; CIRCULAR CAPILLARIES; CFD SIMULATIONS; CO2 SOLUBILITY; MIXED-SOLVENTS; HEAT-TRANSFER; TAYLOR FLOW; SLUG-FLOW; DROPLETS	A detailed understanding of the scaling behavior associated with the fluid flow and the transport of gas molecules from a train of elongated gas plugs into neighboring liquid segments is of great importance for a broad range of microscale applications. The indirect dependence of the parameters affecting the Capillary and Peclet numbers and thereby scaling behavior (i.e., the velocity and length of the gas plugs, and the length of the liquid segments) on the directly adjustable experimental inputs (i.e., flow rate or pressure of each phase) has hindered the systematic investigation of scaling behavior in microscale gas liquid flows. Here, we take advantage of an image-based feedback strategy that allows us to directly impose Capillary and Pedet numbers. We custom fabricated a long, straight microchannel (width 300 mu m, length-to-width ratio 700) in a gas impermeable silicon glass substrate. We automatically determined the length reduction of initially uniformly sized gas plugs at different positions along the microchannel and elucidated the gas concentration within adjacent liquid segments. In accordance with penetration theory, we analytically estimated the gas liquid mass transfer time to scale with the Pedet number, Pe, to the power of -0.5. The experimentally measured scaling exponent -0.55 +/- 0.5 for carbon dioxide dissolution in methanol and ethanol at Pe = 2060-16500 compared favorably with the analytical prediction and provides a guideline for predicting physical transport for a wide range microscale gas liquid flow processes.

Evaluation of Ion Effects on Surfactant Aggregation from Improved Molecular Thermodynamic Modeling	INDUSTRIAL & ENGINEERING CHEMISTRY RESEARCH			English	Article							SODIUM DODECYL-SULFATE; SPHERE-ROD TRANSITION; AQUEOUS NABR SOLUTIONS; COUNTERION BINDING; RODLIKE MICELLES; HALIDE SOLUTIONS; BROMIDE; ELECTROLYTES; RELAXATION; GROWTH	An improved molecular thermodynamic model has been developed and applied to various pure, binary, and ternary mixed surfactants in aqueous solution containing salt (0-3 M). The effect of counterion activity and surfactant activity on surfactant aggregation is considered. The effect of counterion and co-ion specificity on aggregation properties is successfully evaluated. The predicted aggregation properties, including critical micelle concentration (cmc), micelle shape, micelle size, and sphere-to-rod transition, agree well with experimental data. The developed model provides a potential method to evaluate ion effects on aggregation properties of various surfactants in salt solution at various concentration levels, and thus will be of great value to guide the application of surfactants in industrial products and processes, such as corrosion prevention, oil recovery, and pharmaceuticals.

Characterization of a New Ionic Liquid and Its Use for CO2 Capture from Ambient Air: Studies on Solutions of Diethylenetriamine (DETA) and [DETAH]NO3 in Polyethylene Glycol	INDUSTRIAL & ENGINEERING CHEMISTRY RESEARCH			English	Article							CARBON-DIOXIDE CAPTURE; PROTONATED POLYAMINE MATRIX; COORDINATION GEOMETRY; SUPRAMOLECULAR DESIGN; HAYWARD KIWIFRUIT; VAPOR-PRESSURE; ADSORBENT; EFFICIENT; SOLVENTS; ETHYLENE	The development of effective CO, capture technologies with low environmental impacts has been the focus of much recent research. Additionally, consideration is being given as to how CO2 sorbent systems may be applied to small-scale CO, capture. After developing a useful CO, capture system using the simple amine diethylenetriamine (DETA), we decided to investigate how the nitrate salt of DETA, [DETAH]NO3, with a reported high affinity for CO2 and exhibiting many of the ideal characteristics of an ionic liquid, would compare to DETA in terms of its performance as a CO2 sorbent. As a first step, [DETAH]NO3 was prepared and characterized using X-ray crystallography. For the CO2 capture studies, polyethylene glycol (PEG 200) was chosen as the solvent because of its nonreactivity toward the sorbent and CO2 as well as its low volatility and toxicity. Solutions of both DETA and [DETAH]NO3 in PEG 200 were found to perform optimally at a concentration of roughly 10% (v/v). [DETAH]NO3 proved slightly better for CO, uptake at lower concentrations (5% v/v), while DETA performed better at higher concentrations. However, [DETAH]NO3 was calculated to have a vapor pressure considerably lower than that of DETA over the entire temperature range studied. Both the DETA and [DETAH]NO3 solutions could be regenerated, with no observed degradation, over several heating and cooling cycles. These results, paired with the many favorable physical characteristics of ionic liquids, make [DETAH]NO3 a viable alternative for CO2 capture and ideal for application in small-scale CO2 capture from ambient air.

Although several efforts have been made to develop HClO-selective fluorescent sensors, most of them display delayed response time and the ratiometric sensors are rare. In the current work, we used a 3-pyrrole BODIPY dye as a new ratiometric fluorescent sensor (BRClO) for HClO. BRClO exhibited a 177-fold fluorescence ratio (F-505 nm/F-585 nm) enhancement in the presence of HClO over other ROS with fast response time (completed within 1 s). Confocal fluorescence imaging with BRClO showed separated signals in the presence of exogenous HClO in live cells. In addition, BRClO could be easily prepared as HClO test strips to detect HClO in aqueous solution and natural tap water.

A Perspective on Modeling and Characterization of Transformations in the Blocky Nature of Olefin Block Copolymers	INDUSTRIAL & ENGINEERING CHEMISTRY RESEARCH			English	Article							CHAIN-SHUTTLING POLYMERIZATION; MONTE-CARLO-SIMULATION; MULTIBLOCK COPOLYMERS; CRYSTALLIZATION KINETICS; PROPERTY RELATIONSHIPS; MECHANICAL-PROPERTIES; MESOPHASE SEPARATION; UNIAXIAL DEFORMATION; MICROSTRUCTURE; ETHYLENE	Traditional characterization methods are still unable to reveal the block structure of olefin block copolymers (OBCs). Therefore, when the predictability of our well-developed computer code (Mohammadi et al. Macromolecules, 2014, 47, 4778-4789) is extended, the blocky nature of OBCs is modeled and characterized. The expanded model could produce a diversity of macromolecules varying in the concentration of chain-shuttling agent, catalyst ratio, and monomer composition as key processing variables. The OBCs were screened and distinguished in view of chain-related specifics, i.e., chain length and chemical composition distribution, as well as block-related characteristics, i.e., number, length, and chemical composition of hard and soft blocks. A detailed picture of the blockiness was captured and visualized tracing transitions in the microstructure of copolymers, from the case corresponding to a blend copolymer (without any shuttling) to an OBC (with considerable shuttling) and then to random copolymers, reflecting the significance of the chosen parameters in determining the blockiness of OBCs.

The monolith-like Pt/MnO2/TiNT was then applied to low-concentration HCHO oxidation with enhanced efficiency. The effect of the MnO2 promotion on its performance for HCHO oxidation was studied with respect to the behavior of adsorbed species on the catalyst surface using in situ diffuse reflectance Fourier transform spectroscopy. In comparison with Pt/TiNT, Pt/MnO2/TiNT shows higher activity under parallel preparation and test conditions. A HCHO conversion of 95% with a more than 100 h stable performance is achieved over Pt/MnO2/TiNT at 30 degrees C with a low 0.20 wt % Pt loading amount. The superior performance is related to the specific monolith-like structure and its confinement effect, metal-support interaction, and superior HCHO adsorption and storage properties of Pt/MnO2/TiNT.

Characterizations indicate that Ag nanoparticles are well deposited on the surface of ZnO nanorods. It is interesting to note that the introduction of only 1 wt % Ag in ZnO-Ag hybrids leads to the impressive enhancement in gas-sensing properties of ZnO. Notably, the ZnO Ag hybrids can offer a gas response value of 884.7 toward 1000 ppm of ethanol (approximately 12.6 times higher than pure ZnO nanorods). Meanwhile, the hybrids exhibit excellent stability with only +/- 5% fluctuation of the gas response value over a period of 480 cycles. Moreover, the above-mentioned hybrids also exhibit good selectivity (about 4.7-52.9 times greater than that of other tested vapors). The high sensitivity, good selectivity and excellent stability presented by ZnO-Ag hybrids make it a potential material for developing an excellent gas-sensing sensor toward ethanol.

The ND enhanced the dynamic storage modulus of epoxy while decreasing the glass transition temperature because of the increment of free volume in the vicinity of the ND surfaces. The ND induced an acceleration effect on the curing reaction which could be due to functional groups of the ND and lack of any steric hindrance on molecules by the ND particles themselves. The Vyazovkin model-free isoconversional method indicated that all NDs decreased the activation energy; among them, AND showed the lowest value because of the significant promotion of the epoxide ring-opening reaction by polar amino groups. The Sestak-Berggren kinetics model was used to predict successfully the cure kinetics of epoxy/ND.

Moreover, the outdoor performance of the designed gas treatment PBR can be estimated using the novel simulated diurnal cycle experimental setup and procedures developed in this study. Using the design method and the performance estimation experimental procedure, a 10 L outdoor gas treatment PBR has been designed and built in Hong Kong. It is expected to consume 9.97 g of CO2 and generate more than 7.25 g of O-2 during an operation period of two weeks.

By use of H2O2, these (co)polymers can be efficiently mineralized at a relatively low temperature (300 degrees C). When PVDF was heated with 3.0 M H2O2 for 6 h, which corresponds to 31 times the molar amount of fluorine and 32 times the molar amount of carbon in the polymer, both F- and CO2 yields reached 98%. Poly(VDF-co-CTFE) copolymer was also mineralized under the same reaction conditions (the yields of F-, CO2, and Cl- were 98, 95, and 97%, respectively). Poly(VDF-co-HFP) copolymer was more readily decomposed than poly(VDF-co-CTFE), leading to almost complete mineralization (F- yield, 96%; CO2 yield, 92%) with 2.0 M H2O2. Addition of stoichiometric Ca(OH)(2) to the reactions formed CaF2 well-identified by X-ray diffraction spectrometry.

Pt/Al2O3 and Pt/C catalysts exhibited high activity giving 3-ethylaniline as the only product, while Pt/ZnO displayed high selectivity toward target 3-vinylaniline at close to full substrate conversion due to PtZn alloy formation. The catalyst also showed a robust behavior without detectable catalyst deactivation in repeated reaction runs. The most suitable solvent for this reaction was ethanol. Kinetic modeling for nitrostyrene hydrogenation was successfully performed based on the proposed parallel-consecutive reaction network. Application of Pt/ZnO for hydrogenation of various 3-substituted (-CH3, -H, -Cl, -Br, -CHCH2, -COOH, and -NO2) nitroarenes resulted in almost exclusive formation of the corresponding aminocompounds.

The influences of different operating conditions on the SO2 removal efficiency, such as sodium hydroxide concentration, liquid-to-gas ratio, gas velocity and SO2 concentration, were examined. The overall volume transfer coefficients (k(G)a), under moderate conditions, were obtained by introducing the instantaneous and irreversible chemical reaction into the two-film theory to establish a model that allowed the calculation of theoretical values of the overall volume-transfer coefficient. It was found that the absorption process was controlled by diffusion through gas film when a highly concentrated caustic soda solution was adopted. The overall volume-transfer coefficient was essentially independent of concentration of SO2 in gas phase and positively related to the gas and liquid flow rates. The formula of k(G)a was fitted for the process and found to be in good agreement with experimental results.

The adsorption capacity of Pt/NaY-5iO(2) is much greater than those of NaY-SiO2 and V2O5/NaY-SiO2, even though the adsorption rate was lower. To elucidate the causes of difference in the performance, the surface species on the adsorbents were characterized by using XAS and FT-lit The results indicate that active Pt clusters on NaY not only adsorb ethanol but also catalytically convert the adsorbed ethanol to ethoxides and aldehyde. Those Pt adsorbed species could spillover to displace sodium and acid site bound water, leaving the Pt clusters for further adsorption, and thus increase ethanol adsorption capacity. However, the adsorption process involves slow diffusion of the surface species from Pt clusters to NaY-SiO2, resulting in lower overall adsorption rate. In contrast, the VO4 species formed on NaY-SiO2 just covers up the adsorption sites without adsorption capability, leading to decrease in adsorption capacity.

Subsequently, we studied the correlation between the composites' mechanical and thermal properties, and their structures. When the MWCNT concentration in the composite exceeded 13 wt %, the composite's mechanical and thermal properties were improved, and unique properties were exhibited such as swelling in a good solvent. Significant improvement of these properties was hypothesized to be caused by three-dimensional "cell structure" formation in the matrix. Solvent dip tests of the composites and structural analyses of dried samples after the dip tests showed that epoxidized styrene butadiene styrene triblock copolymer (ESBS) matrix combined on the surface of MVVCNTs to form an interfacial phase. The formed three-dimensional continuous structure exhibits a very high elasticity modulus and good heat tolerance, which substantially improves the elasticity modulus and heat tolerance of the ESBS matrix.

An amidoxime-based cationically charged fibrous sorbent is reported here for potential uranium extraction from seawater. Specially, poly(1-vinylimidazole) was grafted onto polypropylene nonwoven fabric under gamma-ray irradiation and was followed by quaternization and amidoximation to give the fibrous sorbent. The sorption could reach equilibrium with a capacity of 119.76 mg U/g within 50 h at pH 8.0 and 298.15 K. Compared with the uncharged sorbent, the cationic sorbent showed faster kinetics, higher selectivity, and larger capacity for uranium extraction. This work indicates that the canonically charged poly(amidoxime)-grafted nonwoven fabric may be a potential promising sorbent to extract uranium from seawater.

It has been previously shown that BP-10, a compound designed to mimic the properties of ARN, can form gel at the oil/water interface by reacting with Ca2+ if the pH is high enough to ionize BP10s carboxylic acid functions. In this study, the BP-10 and ARN are compared. Although BP-10 forms a gel at the interface, ARN creates rather a viscoelastic material perhaps due to the presence of impurities like naphthenic acids in the sample analyzed. The amount of BP-10 required to form a gel at the interface was found to be ca. 0.45-0.76 mg.m(-2). The influence of the presence of asphaltenes on the gel formation has then been studied. It has been found that the gel is weakened in the presence of asphaltenes and G' is not measurable at high enough concentrations. This inhibition could result from either a competition between ARN and asphaltenes to adsorb at interface or complexation of ARN and asphaltenes in the oil bulk phase. The influence of naphthenic acid (NA) on the gel formation was also studied by considering a commercial mixture of NA from Fluka. It is shown that NA can inhibit the gel formation of ARN or BP-10 at the oil/water interface most likely by acting as a cross-linking termination point agent. Finally, the effect of commercial calcium naphthenate inhibitors on gel strength has been studied. It is found that the inhibitors delay the formation of tetrameric acid gels and reduce their elastic modulus G'. However, results show that the order of inhibitor efficiency depends on the tetrameric acid used (ARN or BP-10). This could be linked to different specific inhibitor/TA interactions between ARN and BP-10. In conclusion, interfacial shear rheology appears to be a promising method to screen calcium naphthenate inhibitor.

The cross-linked ENR phase exhibits a continuous net-like structure embedded in the PLA phase, which is different from a conventional plastic/rubber system having the typical "sea-island" morphology in which vulcanized rubber particles were dispersed in plastic matrix. In situ interfacial compatibilization was confirmed by FTIR analysis. The shape-recovery ratios of the PLA/ENR HSMPs were significantly improved over 90%, compared to that (60-70%) of PLA. The shape fixing and memorizing capability of PLA/ENR HSMPs was realized by the glass transition of the PLA phase: cross-linked ENR continuous phase at rubbery state offered strong recovery driving force, improved interface provided effective stress-transferring during shape recovery, and PLA continuous phase served as a "control-switch" for recovery. The biobased PLA/ENR HSMP could serve as a promising alternative to the traditional materials for intelligent biomedical devices.

However, one of the challenging problems in the modeling of FCC riser reactors is that sophisticated flow-reaction models with high accuracy require time-consuming computation, while simple flow-reaction models with fast computation result in low-accuracy predictions. This dilemma requires new types of coupled flow-reaction models, which should own time-efficient computation and acceptable model accuracy. In this investigation, an Equivalent Reactor Network (ERN) model was developed for a pilot FCC riser reactor. The construction procedure of the ERN model contains two main steps: hydrodynamic simulations under reactive condition and determination of the equivalent reactor network structure. Numerical results demonstrate that with the ERN model the predicted averaged error of the product yields at the riser outlet is 4.69% and the computation time is similar to 5 s. Contrast to the ERN model, the predicted error with the plug-flow model is almost three times larger (12.79%), and the computational time of the CFD model is 0.1 million times longer (6.7 days). The superiority of the novel ERN model can be ascribed to its reasonably simplifying transport process and avoiding calculation divergences in most CFD models, as well as taking the back-mixing behavior in the riser into consideration where the plug-flow model does not do so. In summary, the findings indicate the capabilities of the ERN model in modeling description of FCC riser reactors and the possibilities of the model being applied to studies on the dynamic simulation, optimization, and control of FCC units in the future.

This paper presents the design and experimental evaluation of a carbon stripper (CS) in a cold flow model of a 70 kW chemical looping combustor of solid fuels. In the dual fluidized bed system, stable long-term operation was achieved. Plexiglas beads simulating the behavior of fuel particles were mixed with ilmenite particles to study the separation characteristics of the carbon stripper. The factors affecting the carbon stripper performance, such as the gas velocity in the carbon stripper, the solids circulation rates, and the inner structure of the carbon stripper, were experimentally investigated.

Single-stage and multistage extraction experiments were performed to investigate the influence of some important factors. A mathematical model was built to predict the experimental results. The influence of some factors on the multistage separation process, including the extract phase/washing phase ratio (W/O), the concentration of the chiral selector, the pH value of the aqueous phase, and the number of stages, was investigated by experiment and simulation. It was found that the experimental results are in good agreement with the model predictions. The model was applied to predict and optimize the symmetrical separation of KTZ enantiomers. The optimal conditions for symmetric separation involve a W/O ratio of 4.5, a pH of 8.5, and a HP-beta-CD concentration of 0.1 mol/L at 278 K, where ee(eq) (equal enantiomeric excess) can reach up to 38% and Y-eq (equal yield) to 68%. Through modeling, the minimum number of stages was evaluated at 72 and 94 for ee(eq) > 97% and ee(eq) > 99%, respectively.

The microstructure of the synthesized amphiphilic copolymers was characterized by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) and the nuclear magnetic resonance proton spectra (H-1 NMR). The copolymers were blended with poly(ether sulfone) (PES) to fabricate low-fouling ultrafiltration membranes through nonsolvent induced phase separation (NIPS). The surface distribution of the hydrophilic PEG segments and hydrophobic PDMS segments on the membranes via surface segregation during the NIPS process was confirmed by the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), the wetting property, and the surface energy measurements. The multidefense mechanisms from fouling resistant to fouling release for the membranes modified by amphiphilic copolymers P(PEG-r-PDMS) were investigated with bovine serum albumin (BSA) aqueous solution as a model foulant. The antifouling properties of the modified membrane, especially for membrane PES/P(PEG-r-PDMS)similar to 31.3% (M-4), was effectively improved in comparation with pure PES membrane (M-0). The flux decline rate of the membrane M-4 was as low as 15.6%, and the flux recover ratio was up to 96.6%. The modified membrane also possessed stable and durable antifouling properties after three cycles of BSA filtration and chemical washing. It is promising that the present study can offer an effective approach to construct a low fouling membrane in the application of wastewater treatment and water purification.

Here we measured the solubility of N,N'-di(1-naphthyl)-N,N'-diphenyl benzidine (NPB), a typical hole-transport material, in 23 organic solvents by UV absorption spectroscopy. The solubility of NPB in mole fraction unit x(2) ranged widely from 2.4 x 10(-7) in methanol to 2.8 x 10(-3) in chloroform. The solubility data was correlated with the Hansen solubility parameter (HSP) as a function of the solute solvent distance R-a in the 3D HSP space. A least-squares regression to the equation -log x(2) = aR(a)(2) + b, based on the Scatchard - Hildebrand regular solution theory, was carried out to determine the coefficients (a = 0.0102 MPa-1 and b = 2.16) and the HSP of NPB (delta(D) = 22.6 MPa1/2, delta(P), = 6.8 MPa1/2, and delta(H) = 5.8 MPa1/2 for the dispersion, polarity, and hydrogen-bonding interactions, respectively). The correlation enabled us to describe the solvent dependence of the solubility of NPB within the root-mean-square deviation of 0.47 in log x(2) from the experimental data.

Molecular Simulation Study of the Solubility, Diffusivity and Permselectivity of Pure and Binary Mixtures of CO2 and CH4 in the Ionic Liquid 1-n-Butyl-3-methylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide	INDUSTRIAL & ENGINEERING CHEMISTRY RESEARCH			English	Article							PRESSURE PHASE-BEHAVIOR; GAS-TREATING PLANTS; CARBON-DIOXIDE; 1-BUTYL-3-METHYLIMIDAZOLIUM BIS(TRIFLUOROMETHYLSULFONYL)IMIDE; DYNAMICS SIMULATIONS; MEMBRANES SILMS; TEMPERATURE; SEPARATION; HEXAFLUOROPHOSPHATE; EQUILIBRIUM	The knowledge of the mixture solubility and diffusivity of gases in ionic liquids (ILs) is critical for the design of supported ionic liquid membranes (SILMs). Because mixed gas solubilities and diffusivities in ILs are much more difficult to measure than pure gas properties, pure gas solubility and diffusivity data are typically used along with an ideal solubility/diffusivity assumption to estimate permselectivities. It is not clear, however, if the ideal solubility and diffusivity assumptions are valid. In this work, molecular dynamics (MD) and Gibbs ensemble Monte Carlo (GEMC) simulations were used to compute the diffusion selectivity and solubility selectivity of CO2 and CH4 in the IL 1-n-butyl-3-methylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide ([C(4)mim]lTf(2)N](-)), along with the pure gas solubilities and diffusivities, in order to test the ideal permselectivity assumption. Pure gas solubilities of CO2 and CH4 in [C(4)mim](+)[Tf2N](-) at 333 K and pressures ranging from 1 to 100 bar were found to be in excellent agreement with literature values. Simulated CO2:CH4 solubility selectivities in [C(4)mim] [Tf2N](-) at CO2:CH4 gas phase mole ratios of 4:96, 8:92 and 16:84 were found to be less than the ideal solubility selectivities computed from pure gas solubilities. Self-diffusion coefficients of pure CO2 and CH4 dissolved in the IL were independent of the concentration of the dissolved gases, within the studied pressure range. In CO2/CH4 [C(4)mim][Tf2N](-) mixtures, self-diffusion coefficients of CO2 and CH4 were similar for all CO2:CH4 mole ratios. Computed permselectivites were only slightly smaller than the ideal permselectivites computed from pure gas properties. Because the self-diffusion coefficients for CO2 and CH4 are similar, only solubility selectivity was found to influence the overall permselectivity of CO2 over CH4 in the IL.

Effects of PCM and PVA content in the emulsions on nanofiber morphology, heat properties, and phase change stability were examined. Higher PCM loadings in the nanofibers led to increased fiber diameter, gouged fiber surfaces, and higher heat enthalpies. The fibers maintained their morphological integrity even if the PCM melted. They showed reliable heat-regulating performance which can undergo at least 100 cycles of phase change.

The model is used to verify conclusions made in previous experimental work that studied competitive adsorption behavior of paraffinic mixtures in vapor and liquid phase conditions. In these types of breakthrough experiments, a pressure drop in the adsorption column results in a change in aggregation state and density changes inside the column, leading to a change in adsorption behavior. Simulations demonstrate the effect of column temperature, outlet pressure, and pellet size on competitive adsorption behavior, and the importance of the effect of density on adsorption behavior is also demonstrated.

The addition of POSS particles could greatly enhance the hydrophobicity, and a superhydrophobic-superoleophilic membrane was obtained as the POSS concentration increased to 40 wt %. The scanning electron microscopy images indicate that the incorporation of POSS particles results in formations of hierarchical structures on the surface of the PIM-1/POSS fibers. Both the intrinsic hydrophobic nature of FOSS and the increase in the fiber surface roughness led to the sup erhydrophobicity and superoleophilicity. The 40 wt % PIM-1/POSS fibrous membrane could not only separate a wide range of immiscible oil water mixtures with efficiencies higher than 99.95% but also separate water-in-oil emulsions with efficiencies higher than 99.97%. Furthermore, because of the ultrahigh intrinsic microporosity of the PIM-1 polymer, the PIM-1 fibrous membrane exhibited the ability to adsorb a large amount of contaminants such as oil red 0 and solvent blue 35 from oils. Therefore, these membranes are multifunctional and can be applied to treating immiscible water oil mixtures, water-in-oil emulsions, and cleanup of oil soluble contaminants.

Reverse osmosis (RO) is an important process for removing radionuclides from polluted water. The ion concentration of this radioactive polluted wastewater is extremely low compared with that of seawater or normal wastewater. The salt rejection of polyamide RO membranes is known to drastically decrease for feed solutions with extremely low salt concentrations. In this study, the effects of Cs+ concentration on the rejection of polyamide RO membrane were investigated for the efficient removal of Cs-137(+) from the polluted water. To clarify the reason for the decrease in rejection, zeta-potential measurements, CO2 bubbling effects, and usage of CsHCO3 salt were investigated. It is shown that this rejection reduction was caused by HCO3- derived from dissolved CO2 in the feedwater. In addition, methods to avoid decreases in rejection are discussed.

A Group Contribution Pseudocomponent Method for Phase Equilibrium Modeling of Mixtures of Petroleum Fluids and a Solvent	INDUSTRIAL & ENGINEERING CHEMISTRY RESEARCH			English	Article							EQUATION-OF-STATE; PENG-ROBINSON EQUATION; BINARY INTERACTION PARAMETERS; PHYSICAL-PROPERTY MEASUREMENTS; SULFHYDRYL-GROUP SH; PPR78 MODEL; SUPERCRITICAL WATER; PREDICTIVE 1978; HYDROCARBON SYSTEMS; ATHABASCA BITUMEN	We present a group contribution pseudocomponent (PC) method for mixtures of petroleum fluids and a solvent based on the characterization method (CM) for petroleum fractions and the predictive Peng-Robinson 1978 (PPR78) model. The objective of this study is to model the phase equilibrium of crude oil and a solvent consisting of one or multiple pure components. We develop a structural analysis of crude oil to bridge the CM and the PPR78 model, which predicts the temperature-dependent binary interaction parameters (BIP) among the PCs and pure components. The predicted results using our method agree well with experimental data for mixtures of oil sand bitumen and propane, CO2, or water. The approach is applicable to phase equilibrium predictions of mixtures of crude oil and water over a wide range of temperatures (273-644 K or higher as reasonable extrapolations) and pressures (4 kPa-26 MPa).

Electrochemical Properties of Ni47Ti49Co4 Shape Memory Alloy in Artificial Urine for Urological Implant	INDUSTRIAL & ENGINEERING CHEMISTRY RESEARCH			English	Article							MARTENSITIC-TRANSFORMATION; CORROSION-RESISTANCE; URETERAL OBSTRUCTION; DEGRADATION BEHAVIOR; BONE IMPLANT; NI; STENTS; TI; BIOCOMPATIBILITY; MANAGEMENT	The corrosion performance of Ni47Ti49Co4 shape memory alloys (SMA) in artificial urine solution was evaluated in comparison with Ni51Ti49 alloy as reference, at 37 degrees C and pH 5.6-6.4. SEM results revealed less pitting attack for Ni47Ti49Co4 SMA surface after immersion in artificial urine solution. The XRD analysis demonstrated the formation of passive film on Ni47Ti49Co4 SMA. The XPS analysis indicated that the film mainly consisted of 0, Ti, Co, P, and a small amount of Ni, and the concentration of Ni ions release was greatly reduced compared to that of the Ni51Ti49 SMA. Linear polarization results illustrated that corrosion potential (E-corr), corrosion current density (i(corr)), and ac polarization resistance (R-p) were affected greatly by alloying Co to Nitinol alloy. Our observations indicated that the corrosion resistance of the ternary alloy, Ni47Ti49Co4 SMA, offers superior corrosion resistance in artificial urine when compared to Ni51Ti49 SMA, which was suitable for medical applications.

High-Temperature Desulfurization of Coal Gas over Sm Doped Mn-based/MSU-S Sorbents	INDUSTRIAL & ENGINEERING CHEMISTRY RESEARCH			English	Article							REGENERABLE SORBENTS; NITRIC-OXIDE; ZINC-OXIDE; HOT; PERFORMANCE; CATALYSTS; NANOPARTICLES; FABRICATION; COMPOSITE; MECHANISM	Hexagonally ordered rnesoporous MSU-S was assembled from nanoclustered zeolite seeds. The XRD and BET results verified that after treated in 10%H2O/N-2 atmosphere at 800 degrees C for 2 h, MSU-S still remained a well-ordered hexagonal structure due to rich acidic sites and excellent hydrothermal stability. A series of SmxMnyOz/MSU-S sorbents were prepared by a sol gel method. The desulfurization performances of the 55%Sm5Mn95/MSU-S sorbent were improved significantly due to high hydrothermal stability of MSU-S with high surface area as well as the synergistic effect between Mn and Sm2O3. The result of eight successive sulfurization/regeneration cycles of sorbent illustrated that high breakthrough sulfur capacity and endurable stability of 55%Sm5Mn95/MSU-S correlated closely with the existence of the framework 4-coordination aluminum (NH3-TPD, Al-27. MAS NMR) and high dispersion of Sm/Mn species on MSU-S (XRD, TPR) for H2S removal. HRTEM images and SAED patterns confirmed that fresh 55%Sm5Mn95/MSU-S existed in high ordered mesoporous structure and the nanosized Sm2O3 and Mn3O4 particles occurred in highly dispersive polycrystallites. The valence state of Mn species and the regeneration process of used sorbent were characterized by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and TG/DSC. In addition, the effects of reaction temperature, feed composition and Sm/Mn atomic ratio in sorbents on desulfurization performance were investigated.	[Liu, B.

The reactions taking place in several stages are slow and consume large amounts of chemicals. The present study demonstrates a novel three-stage pulp bleaching sequence that combines a tertiary amine-catalyzed hypochlorite oxidation with subsequent treatments with ozone and hydrogen peroxide. With this sequence, the residual lignin and hexenuronic acid contents of an oxygen-delignified eucalyptus pulp were decreased by >> 90%, and a full brightness (88% ISO) was achieved. The total reaction time was only 1 h, which is one-fifth of the retention time of the current industrial pulp bleaching sequences. The chemical need was low, and the viscosity of the pulp remained high. This study may open new doors to future pulp bleaching with fewer and smaller bleaching towers and diminished use of chemicals.

Sorption-Enhanced Variable-Volume Batch-Membrane Steam Methane Reforming at Low Temperature: Experimental Demonstration and Kinetic Modeling	INDUSTRIAL & ENGINEERING CHEMISTRY RESEARCH			English	Article							LIQUID FUEL INTRODUCTION; REACTOR HAMR SYSTEM; HYDROGEN-PRODUCTION; SYNTHESIS GAS; PROMOTED HYDROTALCITE; INTRINSIC KINETICS; CARBON-DIOXIDE; DESIGN ASPECTS; CO2 CAPTURE; PD-AG	To meet the stringent requirements of distributed hydrogen production, combined reaction separation approaches to the endothermic steam methane reforming process have been investigated widely as a potential means to reduce the required reaction temperature, ratio of steam to methane in the fuel (or steam to carbon ratio), and number of sequential unit operation steps. CHAMP-SORB (CO2/H-2 active membrane piston reactor in combination with in situ CO2 adsorption) is a new reactor technology for distributed hydrogen production from methane that incorporates both a hydrogen-selective membrane and CO2 adsorption into a variable volume batch operation using a four-stroke cycle. Active control of the reactor volume, and hence pressure, in combination with continuous removal of both reaction products allows CHAMP-SORB to circumvent the equilibrium limitations of the steam methane reforming (SMR) reaction, which otherwise limit fuel conversion, especially at temperatures below 500 degrees C with a stoichiometric fuel mixture. In this work, we present the first demonstration of an operating CHAMP-SORB reactor, achieving,SMR at temperatures as low as 400 degrees C and at a steam-to-carbon ratio of 2:1. A kinetic model of the CHAMP-SORB process is developed; verified for agreement with detailed experimental measurements; and used to investigate the interactions between the reaction, permeation, and adsorption processes. Time scale analysis is introduced to explore the relationship between reactor component design characteristics and the rate-limiting steps of the CHAMP-SORB process. Supported by the results of kinetic simulations, the scaling analysis provides a powerful tool for rapid exploration of the operating space, including operating temperatures and hydrogen collection and utilization pressures.

The product samples contained a mixture of low molecular weight acids and aldehydes, such as glyceraldehyde, glycolic acid, lactic acid, acetic acid, and methylglyoxal. Quantification of products accounted for all the input carbon, within 95 +/- 5% between 493 and 533 K. A thermodynamically consistent kinetic model using thermodynamics of species derived from static electronic structure computational methods and rate parameters obtained from experimental data at initial stages of DHA decomposition is developed. The reaction pathway for DHA decomposition involves isomerization producing glyceraldehyde; dehydration to methylglyoxal; fragmentation to glycolic acid; and further decomposition of methylglyoxal to lactic acid, which becomes relevant at 553 K. The DHA product speciation is kinetically, rather than thermodynamically, controlled.

When the initial charged methyl tert-butyl ether to tert-butyl alcohol molar ratios were varied and no other reagents were used, the composition effect on activity coefficient calculation was evaluated. As compared with theoretical thermodynamic values, the modified UNIFAC method with proper model parameters is better than the UNIFAC and UNIQUAC methods for calculating the activity-based equilibrium constants of the quinary reaction system. Introducing the best model, the modified UNIFAC method, the determined standard enthalpy and entropy changes for the formation of methyl tert-butyl ether are -36.1 +/- 2.6 kJ/mol and -73.8 +/- 0.9 J/mol/K, and those for tert-butyl alcohol are -34.2 +/- 2.8 kJ/mol and -86.5 +/- 1.0 J/mol/K, respectively. These results are comparable to literature data.

The impact of silica binder on the structure and surface properties of NaY-SiO2 extrudate was investigated. The nitrogen adsorption/desorption isotherm suggests the formation of cylindrical mesopores for NaY-SiO2. X-ray powder diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, and Fourier transform infrared suggest that in kneading, dealumination and cleavage of the intracrystalline Si-O-Al bond via acid hydrolysis occur. This acid hydrolysis causes shrinkage of the zeolite lattice along the zeolite channel due to dislodgement of Al3+ cations. The dealumination increases the silica/alumina ratio of NaY concomitantly with the removal of Na+, leading to an increase in the hydrophobicity of NaY, while reaction of the silica binder with NaY debris and/or aluminum residue forms new Bronsted acid sites. Moreover, backfilling the vacancies created in the dealumination by mobile Si(OH)(4) makes the zeolite more thermally stable, which lends the extrudate itself to industrial applications.

We used molecular simulations to screen 250 different MOP structures in order to examine their adsorption-based CH4/H-2 separation performances. Adsorption selectivity, working capacity, sorbent selection parameter, and regenerability of MOFs were calculated and compared with those of traditional nanoporous materials. The accuracy of simple models that can predict adsorption selectivity of MOFs based on structural properties of materials was discussed. With the use of molecular dynamics, gas diffusivities were computed in the MOFs which were identified as the top performing materials for adsorption-based CH4/H-2 separation. Membrane selectivities of these MOFs were predicted to discuss kinetic separation performances of materials. Results showed that there is a significant number of MOFs that exhibit extraordinarily large adsorption-based and membrane-based CH4/H-2 selectivities compared to well-known nanoporous materials such as zeolites. Using MOFs as adsorbents rather than membranes would be more efficient in CH4/H-2 separation.

In this study, mesoporous carbon grafted activated carbon fibers (ACF@OMC) with different pore size were fabricated by using boric acid as the expanding agent. To study the pore structure and pore size effect on the electro-Fenton (E-Fenton) efficiency of ACF@OMC cathode materials, disordered mesoporous carbon grafted activated carbon fibers (ACF@DMC) were also prepared, and both anionic dye (Orange II) and cationic dye (Rhodamine B) were selected as target organic pollutants. Meanwhile, electro-induced generation rates of hydrogen peroxide and hydroxyl radical were measured. It was found that the E-Fenton efficiency of the cathode materials follows the increasing order of ACF@DMC < ACF@OMC-3.7 < ACF@OMC-5.4. Even after 10 consecutive experiments, the reactivity of ACF@OMC-5.4 cathode materials almost remained unchanged, indicating its promising application in practical wastewater treatment. This study gives new insights into design and preparation of carbonous materials with superior efficiency.

The design is based on the hypothesis that the next frontier of studies within continuous, hydrothermal synthesis lies as much with scalability as it does with the materials properties and performance in applications. Therefore, this reactor belongs to the up-scaled end of a laboratory system with a synthesis capacity of up to 50 g/h. Commissioning was accomplished with TiO2 nanoparticles as a model material. Results comply with earlier ones obtained from single-stage reactors. Dual-stage synthesis of a TiO2@SnO2 nanocomposite was performed by adding a SnCl4 solution to newly formed 9 nm TiO2 nanoparticles, yielding deposition of 2 nm rutile SnO2. Synthesis of pure SnO2 produced much larger nanocrystals, indicating that TiO2 nanoparticles provide the nucleation sites for SnO2 and impede the growth beyond 2 nm.

This method not only inherits the ability of NPE to discover the local structure of data but also implements online fault detection by monitoring the local information changes of new observations. Moreover, the incorporation of the statistical local approach allows that no assumptions have to be made on data distribution, since the constructed new monitoring vectors approximately follow multivariate Gaussian distributions. Thus, the confidence limits of two statistics constructed for process monitoring can be easily determined by chi(2) or F distributions. Furthermore, the new developed method can also improve the detection sensitivity significantly. To evaluate the performance of this new monitoring scheme, it was tested in the Tennessee Eastman(TE) benchmark process, and the experimental results have demonstrated its superiority.

Multiresolution Optimal Control in Dynamically Directed Self-Assembly of Nanoparticles	INDUSTRIAL & ENGINEERING CHEMISTRY RESEARCH			English	Article							ALGORITHM; SYSTEMS	This paper presents an optimal control strategy that can guide any initial random configuration of nanoparticles to a final structure of desired geometry, in minimum time. It employs a multiresolution view of the dynamically evolving configurations of nanoparticles, which are described through the adaptive finite state projection (AFSP) approach introduced in part 3 of this series. External charges, attracting or repelling the nanoparticles, are the controls, whose location and intensity are determined by the optimality conditions of the optimal control strategy. To ensure analytic consistency of the parametric sensitivities, during the computation of the optimal controls, and thus guarantee the optimality of the resulting control policy, a priori determination of enlarged constant projection spaces is shown to be essential. A case study illustrates the use of the proposed optimal control strategy and illuminates several of its features, such as superiority over a static optimal solution; evasion of kinetic traps; and effective handling of combinatorial complications arising for systems with large-size domains and many particles.

Comparisons between the control structures of the two distillation processes are made. The results show that PHIPSD has advantages of economic savings and control compared with the ED process. In addition, some control structures of PHIPSD for feed streams with different composition and some comparisons between the performances of the control structures are also studied. It is concluded that the feed composition mainly impacts the dynamic control structures of PHIPSD through the different combinations of auxiliary heat exchanger and that a composition controller can improve the control performances.

As this technology has commercialization potential, understanding the extraction behavior and modeling the extraction curves are essential. In this study, the extraction kinetics of rice bran oil and its bioactive compounds, namely, alpha-, beta-, gamma-, and delta-tocopherol; alpha-, gamma-, and delta-tocotrienol; and gamma-oryzanol, are discussed and modeled using the diffusion model (DM), logistic model (LM), and simple single plate model (SSPM). Overall, the extraction rate of the oil yield and bioactive compounds was halved after 7 h of extraction. After 15 h of extraction, up to 94.24% of the extractable total tocopherol and 91.79% of the extractable total tocotrienol were extracted. The SSPM is recommended for modeling oil yield and oryzanol, while LM is suitable to model tocopherols and tocotrienols.

Traditional amine solvents suffer from mass loses due to its volatility and poisoning by flue gas impurities. Ionic liquids (ILs) are considered to be promising alternatives for CO2 capture due to their unique features, such as negligible vapor pressure. Despite the extensive research on CO2 capture by ILs, few studies have investigated the effect of flue gas components on CO2 absorption performance. Because of the large differences between CO2 and SO2 in the absorption capacity and partial pressure in flue gas, it is essential to study the role of SO2 in CO2 capture using ILs. This work focused on studying the effect of SO2 with low concentration on postcombustion CO2 capture by 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium acetate [C(2)mim][OAc] and explaining the microscopic mechanism through quantum chemical calculation. Results showed that the CO2 absorption capacity was largely decreased by 25% in the presence of SO2. After 5 cycles of regeneration, the initial absorption capacity of CO2 in [C(2)mim][OAc] remarkably decreased by 48%. Thus, the ionic liquid lost its excellent reversibility and regeneration property for CO, capture under continuous exposure to SO2. The quantum chemical calculation indicated that CO2 could hardly compete with SO2 for the main active sites in [C(2)mim][OAc]. In addition, the net charge transfer amount from acetate anion to CO2 significantly decreased from -0.537 to -0.039 e in the presence of SO,, which explained the decreased absorption capacity of CO2 in [C(2)mim][OAc].

Despite recent advances, the high cost of these materials and the relative inability to regenerate them hinders their use at larger scales. Although it is commonly held that adsorption in fixed bed processes is more efficient than in batch processes, the definition of efficiency needs to be examined closely. In this paper, we show that there exists a critical effluent concentration above which batch processes are more efficient than fixed bed processes from this perspective. This work proposes a simple method to choose either batch or fixed bed processes when the goal is to minimize the quantity of adsorbent needed to remove contaminants to below a specified threshold level. It also provides a systematic set of self-consistency checks on experimental measurements that may be used for comparative studies of these methods.

In this study, the performance of a number of integral thermo-hydraulic models is examined on the basis of the comparison of their predictions against those obtained using a validated, more rigorous but computationally demanding numerical one-dimensional steady-state flow model. The study is performed for typical 0.4-1.2 m internal diameter pipelines transporting CO2 over distances of up to 100 km at supercritical pressures ranging from 90 to 170 bar and temperatures from 20 to 60 degrees C. Buried, insulated, and noninsulated above-ground horizontal pipelines are considered in the analysis. The study concludes that, of the integral models examined, (1) the model based on the nonisothermal compressible flow equation for the pressure drop, combined with the temperature equation accounting for the Joule-Thomson effect and heat exchange at the pipe wall, provides the most accurate model; (2) the model which uses the Darcy-Weisbach equation and accounts for the density variation with the temperature and pressure in the pipe provides a simple method with comparable performance with the first method; (3) using the Darcy-Weisbach equation with constant density can lead to very large errors in pressure drop calculations.

In order to estimate the thermal conductivity of pure ionic liquids, a group method of data handling model is proposed based on 23 ionic liquids corresponding to 216 experimental data points. The average absolute relative deviation for all studied systems was 1.79%, which is a satisfactory degree of accuracy for the proposed model. Furthermore, the Maxwell model is modified to correlate the thermal conductivity of ionanofluids as a function of temperature and volume fraction of nanoparticles. The average absolute relative deviation for this model is 0.61%. Additionally, Maxwell and modified geometric mean (mGM) models are used to evaluate the models that predict the thermal conductivity of ionanofluids. The results show that mGM is more accurate for prediction of thermal conductivity of ionanofluids.

We incorporated the conceptual segment approach of the NRTL-SAC activity coefficient model with modification of binary interaction parameters for the conceptual segments. The conceptual segments are represented by n-hexane, dimethyl sulfoxide, nitromethane, and water as hydrophobic, polar attractive, polar repulsive, and hydrophilic, respectively. The UNIQUAC-SAC molecular parameters are obtained for 82 common solvents, 62 of which are common solvents in the pharmaceutical industry. The UNIQUAC-SAC and NRTL-SAC models are employed to compute the vapor liquid equilibrium of binary, ternary, and quaternary systems. In most cases, the UNIQUAC-SAC model gives a better prediction than the NERL-SAC model. Moreover, the UNIQUAC-SAC model is extended to modeling the solubility of organic nonelectrolyte solute in common solvents. Finally, using the UNIQUAC-SAC and NRTL-SAC models, the solubility data of several pharmaceutical solutes is calculated in one- and two-solvent systems and compared with experimental results.

The main advantage of this extraction process is that no molecular diluent and ligand need be added to the organic phase, so the use of volatile organic compounds can be avoided. Uranium was extracted into the ionic liquid (IL) phase as the [Na3UO2(CO3)(3)](-), [Na3UO2(CO3)(2)Cl-2](-), and [NaUO2CO3Cl2](-) anion complexes, and the composition of the IL, Cl- ions, went into aqueous phase, which was determined by electrospin ionization mass spectroscopy (ESI-MS) and Cl- ion test experiment. The extraction mechanism is anion exchange. The maximum loading capacity of the IL is 11.23 g/L. F- ions have no effect on the extraction efficiency for uranium extraction. The stripping of uranium from the IL phase after extraction is difficult using dilute nitric acid and other stripping reagents. The 1 mol/L NaOH solution was used to deposit uranium and this operation was repeated three times to remove uranium from the IL thoroughly.

The main components of an emulsion are the two liquid phases, typically oil and water, and the emulsifier, which stabilizes the interface between the two liquid phases. Emulsifiers can be a variety of molecules, such as polymers, amphiphilic surfactants, and proteins, and they can also be colloidal particles. Emulsion phase inversion is the process of interconversion between two types of simple emulsions: water-in-oil and oil-in-water emulsions. Phase inversion can be induced by shifting the emulsifier affinity from one phase to the other, which is called transitional phase inversion. It can also be triggered by a change in the water-to-oil ratio of the emulsion, which leads to a process known as catastrophic phase inversion. With recent advances in the stabilization of emulsions using colloidal particles and stimuli-responsive surfactants, numerous novel emulsion systems that undergo emulsion phase inversion by means of various mechanisms have been developed. In this review, we highlight the most recent developments in the field of emulsion phase inversion, focusing on transitional phase inversion, inversion of particle-stabilized emulsions, and flow- and shear-induced phase inversion. We also discuss and compare state-of-the-art analytical methods that have been used to detect and understand the emulsion phase inversion process. Our coverage spans from the early concepts of Bancroft's rule through the concept of semiquantitative hydrophilic lipophilic balance to the more recent theoretical models used to predict and control phase inversion phenomena. We conclude this review by presenting an outlook on the future directions and outstanding problems that warrant future investigations to fully understand the mechanism of emulsion phase inversion at the single-droplet level.

First, gamma-Fe2O3/SiO2 sorbents with a three-dimensionally ordered macropores (3DOM) structure were successfully prepared by a colloidal crystal templating method. Then, the performance of the gamma-Fe2O3-based material, e.g., reference gamma-Fe2O3 and 3DOM gamma-Fe2O3/SiO2 sorbents, for H2S capture was compared with that of alpha-Fe2O3 and the commercial sorbent HXT-1 (amorphous hydrated iron oxide). The results show that gamma-Fe2O3 has an enhanced activity compared to that of HXT-1 for H2S capture at temperatures over 60 degrees C, whereas alpha-Fe2O3 has little activity. Because of the large surface area, high porosity, and nanosized active particles, 3DOM gamma-Fe2O3/SiO2 sorbent shows the best performance in terms of sulfur capacity and utilization. Moreover, it was found that moist conditions favor H2S removal. Furthermore, it was found that the conventional regeneration method with air at high temperature was not ideal for the composite regeneration because of the transmission of some amount of gamma-Fe2O3 to alpha-Fe2O3. However, simultaneous regeneration by adding oxygen in the feed stream allowed the breakthrough sulfur capacity of FS-8 to increase up to 79.1%, which was two times the value when there was no O-2 in the feed stream.

However, data on regeneration energy and performance is limited in literature. In this study, the reboiler heat duties of triethylenetetramine (TETA) and triethylenetetramine (TETA) + N-methyldiethanolamine (MDEM were experimentally evaluated in a bench-scale stripper packed with Dixon ring random packing. The effects of various operating parameters on the desorption performance (presented in terms of reboiler heat duty, Q(reboiler)) were investigated, including lean loading, rich loading, amine concentration, solvent flow rate, and amine type. The experimental results showed that the Q(reboiler) was very sensitive to these process parameters. In addition, a comparison of the Q(reboiler) of TETA, monoethanolamine (MBA), and diethylenetriamine (DETA) was conducted to evaluate the potential for TETA's application in the CO2 capture process. The results obtained in this work showed that the Q(reboiler) of TETA, as a function of amount of CO2 released, is lower than that of MEA and DETA.

This study developed a method for capturing CF4 gas via adsorption using microporous carbons. Microporous carbon adsorbents were synthesized by a facile protocol involving carbonization of poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) at high temperatures (400-800 degrees C) without additional activation, and the effects of carbonization on the characteristics and CF, adsorption of PVDF-based adsorbents were investigated. Increasing the carbonization temperature enhanced the textural properties of the adsorbent, resulting in the increased CF4 adsorption capacity. Above 700 degrees C, PVDF was fully dehydrofluorinated, and the microporous carbon synthesized at 800 degrees C exhibited superior textural properties with a maximum CF4 adsorption capacity of 1.85 mol/kg at 25 degrees C under atmospheric pressure. The PVDF-based microporous carbons also exhibited fast adsorption desorption kinetics, excellent cyclic stability, and good selectivity for CF4 over N-2 at relatively low CF4 pressures. The microporous carbons developed in this study have potential for use as novel adsorbents for CF4 capture.

Substantial Enhancement of Heavy Crude Oil Dissolution in Low Waxy Crude Oil in the Presence of Ionic Liquid	INDUSTRIAL & ENGINEERING CHEMISTRY RESEARCH			English	Article							DYNAMIC INTERFACIAL-TENSION; MUTUAL SOLUBILITIES; SURFACE PHENOMENA; MINERAL MATTER; WATER; TEMPERATURE; AGGREGATION; AMMONIUM; BEHAVIOR; CHLORIDE	Enormous production losses have ascended in diverse operational and technical issues due to deposition of heavy crude oil (HCO) in various production components like tubing, near well bore (skin formation), surface storage tank, pipeline blockage, etc. Existing methods employed for the dissolution of HCO are either cumbersome or use organic solvents, which are hazardous to the environment. This study presents findings on the enhanced dissolution of HCO using low waxy crude oil (LWC) in the presence of ionic liquid (IL). The use of ILs is found to be compatible with the polar moieties in heavy crude oil, such as resins, aromatics, and asphaltenes, enhancing its dissolution. Twelve ionic liquids were tested for the dissolution of HCO using LWC. The dissolution of HCO was performed and confirmed using gravimetric analyses, ultraviolet visible (UV-vis) spectrophotometry, Fourier transform-infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), C-13-nuclear magnetic resonance (C-13 NMR), and the interfacial tension (IFT) measurements. The total percentage of dissolution of HCO in LWC (2:3 wt/wt) with 100 ppm of ionic liquid is found to be increased by a magnitude of 30% (71% from 41%) of the standard HCO+LWC alone. The increase in solubility (%) of HCO+ LWC with organic solvent (used for dilution in UV-vis) in the presence of ILs is observed to be a maximum of 38%. The results are further confirmed qualitatively through the use of FT-IR and C-13 NMR spectroscopy. These findings are further supported by the determination of IFT substantiating the fact that the ILs possess the tendency to dissolve and recover residual oil from production systems and reservoirs. In all of the above experiments, the efficiency of the ILs with a longer alkyl chain and a larger ring size is very convincing as compared with the rest of the studied ILs.

The nanofibers of chitosan were obtained by in situ electrospinning and quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) methods. The structure of the modified chitosan was characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and photoluminescence spectroscopy (PL) analysis. The morphology and diameter of the fibers were investigated using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Adhesion of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa) on a nanofiber-coated electrode surface was examined as a function of time using flow-through QCM. QCM results indicate that pchito-NMPF fiber significantly decreases biofilm formation, with possibly greater contributions of NMPF. Adhesion, growth, and detachment of P. aeruginosa were substantially different on pchito-NMPF coatings as compared with those on uncoated quartz crystal electrode. Inhibition of cells on the surface coated with pchito-NMPF fiber was calculated to be approximately similar to 91%.

Resins which contain an amidoxime group have exhibited good extractive properties for gallium and are adopted as the most efficient adsorbent for the recovery of gallium from Bayer liquor. However, the coordination mechanism between the amidoxime functional group of the resin and Ga(III) in Bayer liquor is unclear so far. Here, to identify the preferred action and the binding motif when amidoxime binds with Ga(III), we performed density functional theory (DFT) calculations and subsequent FT-IR spectra analysis for the amidoxime resin before and after adsorption of Ga(III) in Bayer liquor. Single-crystal X-ray diffraction was also used to validate the prediction. The fully relaxed structure and binding energy calculations of a series of complexes containing acetamidoximate (AO(-)) and gallium species, [Ga(OH)(4x)(AO(-))(x)](-), showed that, of the three general binding motifs of the amidoxime group toward metal ions, complexes with oxygen binding motif I are more stable than complexes with chelate binding motif II or eta(2) binding motif III; and Ga(III) in Bayer liquor prefers to coordinate with only one amidoximate rather than two or more amidoximates. The FT-IR spectrum of the resin after adsorption confirmed the coordination between Ga and oximido by the shifting of N-O and O-H stretching vibrations to higher wavenumber and the appearance of Ga-O stretching vibrations. No characteristic stretching band of Ga-N was found in the FT-IR spectra, indicating binding motifs II and III unlikely happened. Structural analysis of the single-crystal Xray diffraction date revaled that the amidoxime ligand is deprotonated at a single oxime oxygen atom and coordinates to one gallium atom only through this oxygen, confirming the oxygen binding motif. Accordingly oxygen binding mode I might be the main binding motifs of amidoxime toward Ga(III) in Bayer liquor, which validated the prediction of DFT calculations.

The nonisothermal crystallization temperature increased upon addition of CA. The crystallization kinetics of isothermal crystallization was quantitatively analyzed. CA is an effective nucleating agent for the enhanced nucleation density and decreased spherulite size of PBA. Addition of CA was favorable for the formation of PBA alpha modification and accelerated the phase transition from the beta modification to the alpha modification. The mechanisms of nucleation, preferential formation of PBA alpha modification, and accelerated phase transition have also been proposed.

Consequently, the process simulation is stochastic as well as fundamental; it returns a distribution of results representing the day-to-day realizations from natural variability. It also expresses day-to-night variation in the cycling solar energy. The simulation is then used to optimize pond design and management (the growth time, raceway depth, pH control, etc.) to improve profitability. Since the simulation is stochastic, nonlinear, and with multiple optima, a multiplayer direct search optimization technique with steady state convergence criteria is used for optimization. Conclusions are that (1) accounting for natural variation in the optimization leads to noticeable improvement in profitability, (2) sensitivity analysis of the model reveals where fundamental science research is needed to underpin critical techno-economic phenomena, and (3) the stochastic optimization approach has wide ranging applicability.

Ionic liquid (IL) is one of the most ideal catalysts since it could catalyze the coupling reaction in a benign environment in the absence of metal and organic solvent. The catalytic activity of a series of pyridinium-based ILs is theoretically investigated. The influences of the nature of cation, methylene chain length, and anion on the catalytic performance are explored. It has been proven that the catalytic activity of pyridinium-based IL is better than that of imidazolium-based and quaternary ammonium-based us. Since the properties of IL could be regulated by variation of cation and anion, four new ILs are designed by introduction of the -COOH, -OH, -SO3H, and -NH2 functional groups into the traditional pyridinium-based IL, respectively. Subsequently, the catalytic performance of four newly designed functionalized pyridinium-based ILs is compared with that of the traditional pyridinium-based IL. Only the carboxyl-functionalized pyridinium-based IL has better catalytic activity than the traditional pyridinium-based IL. It is expected that the theoretical investigation might provide helpful clues for further experiments.

Based on the published literature data, this study aims to develop an integrated decomposition and gasification kinetic model using Aspen Plus software for cellulose, hemicellulose, lignin, and protein model compounds in sub- and supercritical water to model the supercritical water gasification of wet biomass feedstocks regarding the carbon gasification efficiency and gas yields. The model involves 55 reactions in the subcritical region and 74 reactions in the supercritical region. The validation of the model by comparing the experimental results of others has been performed, and the results of the model were found to be in an agreement. The model is capable of predicting reliable results for temperatures up to 650 degrees C, at pressures between 25-30 MPa, and at dry matter concentrations up to 10 wt % in the feedstock. In addition, case studies for microalgae, pig-cow manure mixture, and paper pulp gasification in supercritical water have also been performed.

The kinetic study is based on the optimal reaction conditions determined by response surface methodology. The reaction rate followed first-order kinetics with the activation energy and frequency factor, E = 27.5 kJ/mol and A = 5.35 X 10(5) s(-1), respectively. Based on thermodynamic analysis, the values of Delta H degrees and Delta S degrees of the endothermic reaction were 14.70 and 0.09 kJ/(mol K), respectively, and Delta G degrees = -12.12 kJ/mol. The mass-transfer analysis revealed the pellet sizes of d(p) < 1 mu m proceeded under reaction-limiting conditions. Experimental results confirmed high efficacy of the tested catalyst due to unity effectiveness factor and very low Thiele modulus.

INDUSTRIAL & ENGINEERING CHEMISTRY RESEARCH			English	Article							HYDROGEN-PEROXIDE; IRON-OXIDE; CATALYTIC DECOMPOSITION; DEGRADATION; 2-CHLOROPHENOL; KINETICS; PHENOL; SYSTEM; PHOTODEGRADATION; CONTAMINANTS	Heterogeneous Fenton-like catalysts have received considerable research attention because they could potentially be attractive for oxidative removal of organic contaminants from tertiary wastewater. However, process design is still hampered by insufficient understanding of the chemical pathways involved, and especially whether oxidation activity stems from heterogeneous surface chemistry or minute concentrations of dissolved metal ions in the homogeneous phase. Using inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES) in combination with pH monitoring and ultraviolet visible spectroscopy (UV-vis) we have monitored the degradation of 4-chlorophenol (4-CP) over two Fenton-like heterogeneous systems, namely FeOx supported on TiO2 and CuFe2O4. We show conclusively that these systems proceed predominantly through a homogeneous route via dissolved metal ions from the solid phase catalysts. Control experiments with homogeneous Fe3+ or Cu2+ systems reveal that even minute concentrations (mu M/subppm) of dissolved metal ions leached from the solid phases account for the observed 4-CF degradation rates in the heterogeneous systems. ICP-OES revealed that metal leaching was time-dependent and variable because of pH variations associated with changing acid release rates. Buffering solutions at pH 7.4 suppressed metal leaching (and hence 4-CP degradation) in the FeOx/TiO2 system, but not in others. For example, pH buffering did not entirely suppress metal leaching from CuFe2O4, for which 4-CP degradation was retained through small concentrations of Fe and Cu ions in solution. Our results highlight the importance of careful monitoring of metal content in the aqueous phase, certainly with analytical sensitivity below ppm concentrations of the dissolved metals, and also the crucial influence of timedependent pH variations on the reaction process. Recydability of catalysts, pH buffering of solutions or monitoring of metal content in the solid phase by less sensitive analytical methods, for example, chemical analysis, gravimetry, X-ray fluorescence, or energy dispersive X-ray analysis in electron microscopes, cannot exclude the homogeneous Fenton route in the presence of solid catalysts.

Tailored Nanostructured Thermoplastic Elastomers from Polypropylene and Fluoroelastomer: Morphology and Functional Properties	INDUSTRIAL & ENGINEERING CHEMISTRY RESEARCH			English	Article							DYNAMIC VULCANIZATION; POLYMER BLENDS; PHASE; COMPATIBILIZATION; NMR	Conventional thermoplastic elastomer from rubber plastic blends has rubber domains of a few micrometers dispersed in a plastic matrix. Nanotailoring of novel thermoplastic elastomeric blends from polypropylene (PP) and fluoroelastomer (FKM) by a special green technique generated a unique morphology in which FKM was dispersed in the nanometer range (50-70 nm) into the continuous PP matrix. The evolution of the unique nanostructure morphology was explained with the help of a viscoelastic drop breakup mechanism. The nanostructured blends exhibited superior physical properties and outstanding oil swelling resistance and thermal stability, which increased upon vulcanization of the rubber phase in situ. For example, volume swell of nanostructured PP/FKM blends was 8-10% in ASTM oil #3 at 100 degrees C for 72 h, which was the lowest in this type of thermoplastic elastomer. Insights into how the unique morphology influenced the functional properties of thermoplastic elastomers was provided. These new thermoplastic elastomers can be used in the automotive industry, particularly as a liner material for car hoses where superior flexibility, oil resistance, and heat resistance are desirable properties.

The effects of operating variables on particle size and distribution were investigated. Compared to raw CFX, the mean size of prepared nanoparticles decreased greatly from about 2.1 mu m to 57 rim, and the saturation solubility increased tremendously from 0.289 to 0.951 mg/mL. CFX nanoparticles showed good stability and were capable of generating a maximum supersaturation level, reaching up to similar to 22.8 times of raw CFX's saturation solubility. Further, CFX nanoparticles achieved 100% drug dissolution within 2 min, while the raw drug did not dissolve completely after 45 min, suggesting that the solubility and dissolution properties of CFX nanoparticles were significantly improved. Since the drug recovery ratio achieved 99.9%, and the production capacity of lab-scale RPB with a continuous operation reached 1.8 kg/h, the HGAP method might offer a general and facile platform for mass production of CFX nanoparticles.

Our simulation results demonstrate that both cations and anions show a cylindrical double-shell solvation structure around the SWNTs regardless of the nanotube diameter. In the first solvation shell, the CH3 groups of cations are found to be closer to the SWNT surface than the NH3+ groups because of the solvophobic nature of the CH3 groups, while the NO3- anions tend to lean on the nanotube surface, with three O atoms facing the bulk EAN. On the other hand, the intensities of both C-H (the CH3 group of the cation) and N-O (anion) asymmetric stretching bands at the EAN/SVVNT interface are found to be slightly higher than the corresponding bulk values owing to the accumulation and orientation of cations and anions in the first solvation shell. More interestingly, the N-O stretching band exhibits a red shift of around 10 cm(-1) with respect to the bulk value, which is quite contrary to the blue shift of the O-H stretching band of water molecules at the hydrophobic interfaces. Such a red shift of the N-O stretching mode can be attributed to the enhanced hydrogen bonds (HBs) of the NO3- anions in the first solvation shell. Our simulation results provide a molecular-level understanding of the interfacial vibrational spectra of an EAN IL on the SWNT surface and their connection with the relevant solvation structures and interfacial HBs.

Because of the differences in surface area, thickness, and aspect ratio between the two types of graphene, the graphene graphene and graphene polymer interactions were different in these two nanocomposites. As a result, the two types of graphene nanoplatelets assembled into different interconnected structures in the matrix. Steady-state shear, stepwise small-amplitude oscillatory shear (SAOS) and large-amplitude oscillatory shear (LAOS), and frequency sweep tests immediately after the stepwise shear were used to determine and study the two different graphene aggregate structures. The disruption (under LAOS) and recovery (under SAOS) of the structures were monitored and the great disparities between the two types of graphene were ascribed to their structural roots. The formation of a percolated graphene network structure in the matrix significantly altered the structural evolution under the stepwise shear. This multistep shear process was found to be a very sensitive tool to differentiate sample microstructures while traditional linear viscoelastic tests (i.e., SAOS) failed.

Structure, morphology, and cold crystallization of these nanocomposites were studied using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, and X-ray diffraction (XRD). XRD results reveals that PTT-15A. nanocomposites were fully exfoliated, whereas PTT-30B nanocomposites were partially exfoliated. Non-isothermal cold crystallization temperature and the crystallinity of non-isothermally cold-crystallized PTT-15A nanocomposites increased with increasing 15A content. The crystallinity of isothermally cold-crystallized PTT-15A nanocomposites was shown to increase with crystallization temperature and the clay content, but no clear trend in crystallinity was observed for PTT-30B nanocomposites. The combination of FTIR and DSC has been used to determine the conformational changes during isothermal cold crystallization. The results show that the crystalline gauche and amorphous gauche conformations increased and the amorphous trans conformation decreased with crystallization temperature and clay content for PTT-15A nanocomposites, whereas no trend was observed for PTT-30B nanocomposites.

Recently, significant attention has been focused on the ternary oxide epitaxial overlayers. Here, a highly active {001} facet dominant coaxial-nanocoupled SrTiO3/TiO2 nanotube array thin film was fabricated by a modified two-step anodization combined with a hydrothermal process. Through photoelectrochemical (PEC) measurements, such a coaxial-nanocoupled SrTiO3/TiO2 {001} surface reconstruction can definitely improve its PEC performance. The enhanced PEC performance and strongest photocurrent response of SrTiO3/TiO2 nanotubes (STNs) with a 2 h hydrothermal treatment were ascribed to the fast electron transfer in coaxial nanoarchitecture.

Development of a Population Balance Model to Describe the Influence of Shear and Nanoparticles on the Aggregation and Fragmentation of Asphaltene Aggregates	INDUSTRIAL & ENGINEERING CHEMISTRY RESEARCH			English	Article							PACKED-BED COLUMN; IRON-OXIDE NANOPARTICLES; SIZE DISTRIBUTION; OIL; ADSORPTION; KINETICS; PRECIPITATION; NANOCATALYSTS; INHIBITION; EMULSIONS	The precipitation and deposition of asphaltenes is a primary problem related to the processing, transportation, and production of oil. Flocculation of asphaltene aggregates is likely to occur during the production and processing of crude oil. Recently, it has been shown that nanotechnology in the form of nanopartides is useful for the inhibition or prevention of asphaltene formation damage. Although it is well-known that the adsorption of asphaltenes on the nanopartide surface would reduce the capacity of these asphaltic compounds to interact with each other, limited studies have been performed regarding the processes and the mechanisms associated with the effect of nanopartides on the inhibition of the formation damage due to asphaltenes. To better understand this phenomenon from a mathematical approach, a population balance model (PBM) is proposed to describe the kinetics of asphaltene flocculation-fragmentation in the presence of nanoparticles. The model assumes that asphaltenes in the presence of a shear rate are related to the aggregation and fragmentation phenomena and includes a term related to the asphaltene adsorption on nanopartides. An adsorption kinetic term was introduced into the model using the double exponential model. Experimental data of the kinetics of asphaltene aggregation were obtained by dynamic light scattering (DLS) measurements at a fixed initial asphaltene concentration of 1000 mg/L and with different Heptol mixtures. In this study, commercial silica, gamma-alumina, and magnetite nanoparticles were used as adsorbents to study the effect of the chemical nature of the nanopartides on the inhibition of the asphaltene growth and for model validation. Additionally, to demonstrate the versatility of the proposed model, the effect of asphaltene was also evaluated. The obtained results from the proposed population balance model agree well with the experimental data, within an RSME % < 9%.

Efficient Approach for Scheduling Crude Oil Operations in Marine-Access Refineries	INDUSTRIAL & ENGINEERING CHEMISTRY RESEARCH			English	Article							CONTINUOUS-TIME FORMULATION; SUBSTANTIAL DOWNSTREAM BENEFITS; MULTIMILLION-DOLLAR BENEFITS; OPTIMIZATION; MODELS; BLENDSHOP; ABILITY	Due to the impact of crude oil prices on refinery revenues, the petroleum industry has switched to processing low-cost crude oils. They are blended with high-quality crude oils to feed the crude distillation units (CDUs) with reliable feedstock. The blending process takes place in storage tanks receiving crude parcels from ultralarge carriers and by mixing feed streams supplied to CDUs from multiple tanks. The crude blending and scheduling problem is usually represented by a large nonconvex Mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) model. This work introduces an effective MINLP continuous-time formulation based on global-precedence sequencing variables to arrange loading and unloading operations in every tank. In addition, synchronized time slots of adjustable length permit to model the sequence of feedstock for each CDU. The basic solution approach consists of sequentially solving a very tight mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model and a nonlinear programming (NLP) formulation that uses the MILP-solution as the starting point. For large problems, it has been developed a novel solution strategy that incorporates a time-partitioning scheme using the notion of vessel-blocks. The proposed approach has been applied to a series of large examples studied by other authors finding near-optimal schedules at much lower CPU times.

The modeling approach utilizes linking models at different length and time scales, namely, a kinetic model, a thermodynamic model and a reactor macroscopic model. In addition, a generalized population model equation is utilized to calculate the particle size distribution in the reactor. From the numerical solution of the proposed model, the spatial distribution of the reactants concentration, particle growth rate and particle size distribution in a catalytic polymerization loop reactor can be predicted. The model is further employed to assess the importance of using multifeed injection points along the reactor length for lessening the depletion phenomena and improving the product homogeneity. It is demonstrated that proper selection of the multifeed injection points of the reactants along the reactor length can significantly contribute in producing on-spec polymer grades with narrow particle size distribution.

To solve this problem, a scenario-based early warning system design methodology is proposed. It comprises three steps: (i) scenario identification: events are identified by HAZOP analysis, variables are allocated to the scenario-based group, and the variables states correlated to the scenarios are identified; (ii) model development: Bayesian network of all variables is learned from the process data, and the events nodes are appended according to expert knowledge to construct the Bayesian network model of a scenario-based early warning system; (iii) model implementation: the model is applied online to monitor process, the monitored variables continuously produce evidence, update the events probabilities, find the root causes, and give an events warning message together with the root cause to operators. The methodology implementation and salient points are explained with the help of an easy to follow simple case study.

This column (emptyset(in) = 15 mm; H-ac = 1100 mm), in which both stirring and pulsation are applied, allows for many equilibrium stages and enables a good separation. DNB-(R)-Leu was obtained with an enantiomeric excess of 98.6% and a yield of 93.7%. The other enantiomer DNB-(S)-Leu was measured with an enantiomeric excess of 85.8% and a yield of 98.0%. A backflow model was developed to describe the concentration profile inside the column and the outlet concentrations. The model was experimentally validated and indicates an accurate calculation of the concentrations with an inaccuracy of less than 10%. Finally, the chiral separation of the counter-current extraction in columns is compared to centrifugal extractors with respect to extraction efficiency and productivity.

Filtration experiments were performed using simulated brackish water (1.0 g/L of salt) and simulated dye wastewater (0.1 g/L of dyes). The membrane prepared under optimal conditions exhibited a flux of 12.9 L/(m(2) h), while the rejection of Orange GII reached 94.7% under 0.2 MPa. The antifouling experiment results verified that the resultant membrane (surface free energy as low as 23.0 mJ/m(2)) could effectively resist and drive off foulants such as bovine serum albumin, humic acid, and oil due to the lower adhesion force between foulants and membrane. The excellent antifouling property of the resultant membrane (minimal value of total flux decline ratio similar to 9.1%, maximum value of flux recovery ratio 99.8%) would promote the application of nanofiltration in wastewater treatment.

The solubility data and water activity data of the systems SrCl2-H2O, NaCl-SrCl2-H2O, KCl-SrCl2-H2O, LiCl-SrCl2-H2O, and NaCl-KCl-SrCl2-H2O were used to evaluate the model. Good agreement between the calculated and experimental solubility data indicates that the model is reliable. The Pitzer model for the above system at 298.15 K was then used to calculate the component solubilities and conduct computer simulation of isothermal evaporation of the mother liquor for the oilfield brine in Nanyishan region of Qaidam Basin (China). The evaporation-crystallization route and order of salt precipitation, changes in concentration and precipitation of lithium, sodium, potassium, and strontium, and water activities during the evaporation process were demonstrated. The salts crystallized from the brine in the order: KCl, NaCl, SrCl2 center dot 6H(2)O, SrCl2 center dot 2H(2)O, and LiCl center dot H2O. The entire evaporation crystallization process may consist of six stages. In each stage, the variation trends for the relationships between ion concentrations or water activities and the evaporation ratio are different. This result of the simulation of brines can be used as a theoretical reference for comprehensive exploitation and utilization of this type of brine resources.

Monitoring Electrostatics and Hydrodynamics in Gas-Solid Bubbling Fluidized Beds Using Novel Electrostatic Probes	INDUSTRIAL & ENGINEERING CHEMISTRY RESEARCH			English	Article							DIELECTRIC PARTICLES; FLY-ASH; CHARGING BEHAVIOR; POLARITY; GENERATION; REACTOR; FINES	The ability of recently developed novel electrostatic probes to monitor particle charge density and hydrodynamics in freely bubbling two- and three-dimensional fluidized beds of glass beads and polyethylene particles is demonstrated. Particle charge density and bubble properties in the beds were altered by abruptly changing superficial gas velocity or by impulsively adding antistatic agent to the bed. The probes were then utilized to quantitatively monitor the particle charge density and bubble rise velocity. The current signals from the probes responded quickly and significantly to abrupt changes in the superficial gas velocity. By analyzing time-series signals from the probes, the particle charge density and the bubble rise velocity deduced from the probes were found to be of similar order of magnitudes and changed consistently with those obtained from Faraday cup and video measurements. Charge densities from the Faraday cup decreased when an antistatic agent was added, as registered by the probe.

A novel computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model coupled with a comprehensive chemistry scheme (134 species and 4169 reactions, in CHEMKIN format) has been developed to investigate this complex phenomenon. Previous results from a transient three-dimensional model of primary pyrolysis were used for the source terms of primary products in this model. A parametric study of reaction atmospheres (H2O, N-2, H-2, CO2, CO) has been performed. For the N-2 and H2O atmosphere, results of the model compared favorably to experimentally obtained yields after the temperature was adjusted to a value higher than that used in experiments. One notable deviation versus experiments is pyrolytic water yield and yield of higher hydrocarbons. The model suggests a not overly strong impact of the reaction atmosphere. However, both chemical and physical effects were observed. Most notably, effects could be seen on the yield of various compounds, temperature profile throughout the reactor system, residence time, radical concentration, and turbulent intensity. At the investigated temperature (873 K), turbulent intensity appeared to have the strongest influence on liquid yield. With the aid of acceleration techniques, most importantly dimension reduction, chemistry agglomeration, and in-situ tabulation, a converged solution could be obtained within a reasonable time (similar to 30 h). As such, a new potentially useful method has been suggested for numerical analysis of fast pyrolysis.

Preliminary experiments were carried out at 100-140 degrees C for 15-480 min in systems containing just xylose dissolved in [bmim][HSO4] in the absence of externally added catalysts. More than 95% xylose conversion was achieved when operating at 120 or 140 degrees C for 300 and 90 min, respectively; but just 36.7% of the initial xylose was converted to furfural. Operation in biphasic reaction systems (in the presence of toluene, methyl-isobutyl ketone or dioxane as extraction solvents) at 140 degrees C under selected conditions resulted in improved furfural production (73.8%, 80.3%, and 82.2% xylose conversion to furfural for the cited extraction solvents, respectively).

All these DESs show good thermal stability and can be stable at 363 K, which is beneficial for the application in flue gas desulfurization. Then, SO2 absorption capacities of these DESs were determined at different temperatures and SO2 partial pressures. The absorption results demonstrate that ChCl EG (1:2) and ChCl thiourea (1:1) DESs exhibit excellent absorption performances, and the absorption capacities are 2.88 and 2.96 mol SO2 per mol DES at 293 K and 1 atm, respectively. In addition, the SO2 absorption and regeneration experiments were conducted. All solvents can be regenerated at 343 K with N-2 bubbling, and the absorption capacities of DESs remain without a significant loss after six absorption and desorption cycles. What's more, the absorption mechanism of SO2 in these DESs were investigated by IR and H-1 NMR.

Ascorbic acid was employed as a fuel to synthesize fine ceria nanoflakes by a facile solution combustion process. AgBr and Ag3PO4 were decorated on ceria to prepare AgBr/Ag3PO4/ceria nanocomposites. The structure of the composite was determined by X-ray diffraction analysis. Novel flakelike morphology was revealed using electron microscopy techniques. The nanocomposites exhibit excellent photocatalytic activity under visible light compared to pristine ceria nanoparticles. The nanocomposite catalyst particles degraded both anionic and cationic dyes. It also exhibited efficient antimicrobial activity under visible light. The AgBr/Ag3PO4/ceria nanocomposite was characterized using X-ray diffraction analysis, diffuse reflectance spectroscopy, electron microscopy, BET surface area analysis, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and the reasons for enhanced photocatalytic activity were elucidated. The presence of silver based semiconductors on ceria has shown to decrease charge recombination through photoluminescence analysis that attributed for enhanced photocatalytic activity. The AgBr/Ag3PO4/ceria nanocomposite has shown a stable performance after many repeated cycles.

Thus, the development of methods for selective and sensitive determination of He2+ is very important to understand its distribution and implement more detailed toxicological studies. Herein, we report a simple 4-hydroxynaphthalimide-derived fluorescent probe (1) for the detection of both inorganic and organic mercury species in aqueous solution. Probe 1 could quantificationally detect mercury species by fluorescence spectroscopy with high selectivity and sensitivity. Importantly, probe 1 could serve as a "naked-eye" indicator for mercury species and exhibited a large fluorescent enhancement with the help of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2. Additionally, the mechanism of the reaction between probe 1 and mercury species was confirmed using H-1 NMR and ESI-MS. And, analytical applications of probe 1 to the river water samples further demonstrated that it provided an excellent method for the determination of mercury species in the environment.

All tested polyethylene glycol functional ionic liquids improved lipase catalytic activity, thermostability, organic solvent tolerance, and adaptability to temperature and pH changes in olive oil hydrolysis reaction. In particular, lipase modified by [HOOCEPEG(350)Im] [H2PO4] increased the catalytic activity by 1.7-fold, thermostability by 5.0-fold at 50 degrees C for 2.5 h, organic solvent tolerance by 13.3-fold in 60% dimethyl sulfoxide and 3.4-fold in 5% methanol compared with the native lipase. Investigations by ultraviolet, fluorescence, and circular dichroism spectroscopy revealed microenvironment changes, the increase in beta-sheet and the decrease in alpha-helix content of secondary structures in the modified lipases. These changes were correlated with enzymatic properties alteration, including improved activity and stability of modified lipases. Compared with the results of previous reports, the novel modification with polyethylene glycol functional ionic liquids was more effective in improving the catalytic performance of lipase.

An analytical strategy is developed first, to estimate the optimum thickness of active shell. When the system is strongly mass transfer limited (Thiele Modulus >> 1) it can be represented by slab geometry in order to determine the shell thickness. Otherwise, the analysis is done on a spherical geometry. In the latter case, the continuity equation simplifies into the Emden Fowler equation which was solved via a numerical iterative technique based on prior investigations. A more accurate detailed numerical solution was also developed for this intrapellet model. This numerical result is compared with the analytical solution as well as with a previously published model. The sensitivity of the catalyst performance to temperature and pressure variations was also examined. Performance analysis was carried out considering both rate of reaction and a chain growth probability as yardsticks. These performance parameters were examined using contour maps with Thiele modulus and H-2/CO ratio as their coordinates. On this map there exists an ideal combination of gas ratio and Thiele modulus that fulfills the design requirements of product selectivity and high catalyst activity. This study confirms the need for, and the advantage of, using eggshell morphology for Fischer-Tropsch synthesis applications.

The average size, morphology, and chemical components of the microcapsules were characterized by laser particle size analyzer, scanning electron microscope (SEM), and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR), respectively. The thermal characterizations of the microcapsules were studied by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and thermal gravity analysis (TGA). The results show that the average size of the microcapsules was in the range of 4.0 to 7.0 mu m and decreased with increasing emulsifier. The microcapsulated phase change materials (MicroPCMs) are spherical, and their surface is dented. The MicroPCMs without nucleating agents demonstrated high heat storage capacity but had supercooling phenomena. It was found that the addition of approximately 8.3 wt % nucleating agents 1-tetradecanol or paraffin in core materials can suppress MicroPCMs from supercooling. The MicroPCMs maintained a good thermal stability below 150 degrees C.

The prepared FeNPs@a-C:H films were used as research materials. The synthesized samples were deposited at four different pressures of 2.5, 3, 3.35, and 3.5 N/m(2) in an acetylene gas atmosphere. The Fe and C contents of the thin films were obtained from X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The X-ray diffraction profile and electron diffraction pattern indicate that iron nanoparticles with body-centered-cubic crystalline structure are formed in these films. The localized surface plasmon resonance peak that is the signature of the existence of the iron core nanoparticles appears in visible spectra of these films. The sample surface images were recorded using an atomic force microscope operating in a noncontact mode and analyzed to reveal the statistical, fractal, and functional surface properties of prepared samples. Analysis of the 3D surface texture is essential for the correct interpretation of surface topographic features as well as its functional role for the test surface. It also helps to understand the relationship between the surface topography and functional properties.

In this study, the FO flux behavior was investigated using draw solutes of inorganic salt (NaCl) and neutral polymers (PEGs) with molecular weights of 200-8300. The FO flux dramatically decreased with increasing molecular weight of the DS. Severe internal concentration polarization originated from the lower diffusivity of the larger DS molecules, which brought about the flux reduction. The experimental data were analyzed with a model developed using a virial expansion equation for osmotic pressure in the case of the polymeric draw solutions. The analyzed results fit well with the experimental data, which allowed us to predict a relation between FO performance and the molecular weights of the draw solutes for different FO membranes.

In this study, the applicability of glow discharge plasma (GDP) for simultaneous oxidation of organoarsenic and immobilization of arsenic is unprecedentedly evaluated. The results show that ROX can be effectively oxidized to inorganic arsenic, and this performance is evidently dependent on energy input. Adding Fe(II) can significantly enhance the oxidation of ROX mainly because of the additional production of center dot OH via Fenton reaction in GDP, accompanied by which the generated arsenic can be simultaneously immobilized in one process. The immobilization of arsenic can be favorably obtained at pH 4.0-6.0 and Fe(II) concentration ranging from 500 to 1000 mu M. On the basis of the mineral compositions and analysis (XRD/FTIR/XPS) of precipitate, a mechanism can be proposed that the oxidation of Fe(II) by H2O2 generated in situ in GDP significantly accelerates ROX transformation to the ionic As(V), which can immediately precipitate with Fe(III) ions or be adsorbed on the ferric oxyhydroxides, forming amorphous ferric arsenate-bearing ferric oxyhydroxides. As such, the present study offer a new recipe for rapid decontamination of organoarsenic pollutants, in which the hypertoxic species can be effectively removed from the wastewater.
