J	Vovk, V				Vovk, Vladimir			Ito calculus without probability in idealized financial markets	LITHUANIAN MATHEMATICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						continuous time; cadlag price paths; incomplete markets; pathwise quadratic variation; pathwise stochastic integration	GAME-THEORETIC PROBABILITY	We consider idealized financial markets in which price paths of the traded securities are cadlag functions, imposing mild restrictions on the allowed size of jumps. We prove the existence of quadratic variation for typical price paths, where the qualification "typical" means that there is a trading strategy that risks only one monetary unit and brings infinite capital if quadratic variation does not exist. This result allows one to apply numerous known results in pathwise Ito calculus to typical price paths; we give a brief overview of such results.

The cases of known and unknown (estimated) intensity lead to distinct Gaussian limits and require quite different proofs. Further we determine the limit distributions of the maximal deviation and the integrated squared distance between empirical and true multiparameter second moment function. These results give rise to construct goodness-of-fit tests for checking the hypothesis that a given point pattern is completely spatially random (CSR), that is, a realization of a homogeneous Poisson process.

The usual motivation is that such a process is mean-reverting and takes nonnegative values (for initial nonnegative values). The stochastic Verhulst (SV) equation possesses the same properties. Moreover, one can always choose the parameters of the SV equation so that its solution has the same stationary (gamma) distribution as that of the CIR equation. So, in long run, both processes behave rather similarly. Therefore, the idea to alternatively use the SV process for modeling interest rates seems to be rather natural. In this paper, we first compare SV and CIR and discuss their pros and cons. A serious disadvantage of the SV process is that explicit expressions of its moments are not known. To diminish this gap, the second part of the paper is devoted to approximation of the moments of the SV process.

The idea is to consider Euler-type discrete-time approximations with the increments of the Wiener process replaced by i.i.d. bounded vanishing symmetric random variables. It is shown that the prelimit and limit markets are arbitrage-free, prelimit market is incomplete and admits the minimal martingale measure, and the limit market is complete. The rate of convergence of option prices is estimated using the classical results on the rate of convergence of the distributions of sums of nonidentically distributed random variables to the normal law.

The paper also presents a wide comparative survey of properties of Gini's mean difference statistic and the empirical variance. It includes asymptotic properties of both statistics: the asymptotic normality, one-term Edgeworth expansions, and bootstrap approximations for Studentized versions of the statistics. Estimation of the variances and other parameters of the statistics is also studied, where we use auxiliary information available on the population elements.

Inferences from optimal filtering equation	LITHUANIAN MATHEMATICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						Markov sequence; theorem on normal correlation; Kalman filter; optimal filtering; Toeplitz matrix		The processing of stationary random sequences under nonparametric uncertainty is given by a filtering problem when the signal distribution is unknown. A useful signal (S (n) ) (na parts per thousand 1/21) is assumed to be Markovian. This assumption allows us to estimate the unknown (S (n) ) using only an observable random sequence (X (n) ) (na parts per thousand 1/21) .The equation of optimal filtering of such a signal has been obtained by A.V. Dobrovidov. Our result states that when the unobservable Markov sequence is defined by a linear equation with Gaussian noise, the equation of optimal filtering coincides with both the classical Kalman filter and the conditional expectation defined by the theorem on normal correlation.

The stability parameter alpha determines tail heaviness of marginal distributions of LMSM.

This model is a Markov chain, but, in general, the transition probabilities are nonstationary. Under not too restrictive hypotheses, this model presents the classical duality of branching processes: it either becomes extinct or grows to infinity. Sufficient conditions for the almost sure extinction and for a positive probability of indefinite growth are given. Finally, the rates of growth of the process are studied, provided that there is no extinction.

We present a representation of the density of one-dimensional distribution of Verhulst process. The closed formula for the density of Verhulst process simplifies in the case where the drift of the geometric Brownian motion is equal to -1/2. Some special properties of this process are discussed; in particular, it turns out that, under Girsanov's change of measure, a Verhulst process still remains a Verhulst process, although with other parameters.

Using the white noise representation, we can associate integrators with continuous linear operators in L (2)([0; 1]).

A problem of increasing interest for dimension d > 1 is the following: given an open convex set Omega of (0,a) (d) and a real analytic function V from Omega into the set of linear symmetric operators from a"e (d) , is V a variance function of some NEF? In the real line case of d = 1, this question was already solved. The aim of this work is to give necessary and sufficient conditions on V in order to be the variance function for some multivariate NEF. The notion of absolutely monotonic function on [0,a) (d) is thus introduced, and the determination of moments of the NEF is also involved. For an NEF concentrated on [0,a) (d) , a bridge is established between the behavior of V around of the origin and the existence conditions of the corresponding NEF. Some illustrating examples are presented.

Classical definitions of the Poisson process do not coincide in the case of generalized convolutions	LITHUANIAN MATHEMATICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						generalized convolution; generalized random walk; lack-of-memory property; Markov process; Poisson process; renewal process	DISTRIBUTIONS; PROBABILITY	In the paper, we consider a generalization of the notion of Poisson process to the case where the classical convolution is replaced by the generalized convolution in the sense of Urbanik [K. Urbanik, Generalized convolutions, Stud. Math., 23:217-245, 1963] following two classical definitions of the Poisson process. First, for every generalized convolution auS, we define a auS-generalized Poisson process of type I as a Markov process with auS-generalized Poisson distribution. Such processes have stationary independent increments in the sense of generalized convolution, but usually they do not live on a"center dot(0). A auS-generalized Poisson process of type II is defined as a renewal process based on the sequence S (n) that is a Markov process with step distribution with the lack-of-memory property. Such processes take values in a"center dot(0); however, they must not be Markov processes or have independent increments, even in the generalized convolution sense. It turns out that the second construction is possible only for monotonic generalized convolutions that admit the existence of distributions with lack of memory, and thus we also study these properties.

Lenkas and V. Mackeviius, Weak approximation of Heston model by discrete random variables, Math. Comput. Simul., 113:1-15, 2015], we constructed a first-order weak approximation for the solution of the Heston model that uses, at each step, generation of two discrete two-valued random variables. An extension of that result to a second-order approximation has met some serious challenges, which we have finally overcome in this paper. We construct a second-order weak approximation for the solution of the Heston model that uses, at each step, generation of two simple discrete random variables. The log-Heston equation system is split into the deterministic part, solvable explicitly, and the stochastic part that is approximated by discrete random variables. The approximation is illustrated by several option pricing simulation examples, including the comparison of the constructed approximation with well-known approximations by Andersen and Alfonsi.

This class includes, in particular, some well-known models like the Poisson INGARCH of Ferland, Latour, and Oraichi [4] or the negative binomial and generalized Poisson INGARCH introduced by Zhu in 2011 and 2012, respectively. Within this class, we analyze the existence and ergodicity of a strictly and weakly stationary solution. For a new particular model of that class, the Neyman type-A INGARCH model, we derive the autocorrelation function, analyze the existence of higher-order moments, and obtain an explicit form of their first four cumulants, from which we deduce the corresponding skewness and kurtosis.

J	Damarackas, J; Siaulys, J				Damarackas, Julius; Siaulys, Jonas			A note on the net profit condition for discrete and classical risk models	LITHUANIAN MATHEMATICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						net profit condition; Silverman-Toeplitz theorem; ruin probability; discrete time risk model; classical risk model		Net profit condition is a well-known concept in the ruin theory. This concept describes a situation where the insurer's business can develop avoiding guaranteed ruin. If the net profit condition is not satisfied, then the ruin occurs with probability one despite the large values of the initial insurer's surplus. Usually, this fact is derived from some deep theory of random walks. In this note, we derive the same assertion using simpler tools. For discrete-time risk model, we use the Silverman-Toeplitz theorem, whereas for classical risk model, we use a discretization procedure. We prove that ruin is unavoidable if the net profit condition is not fulfilled for both discrete-time and classical risk models. In addition, we derive formulas of ruin probabilities with zero initial surplus for these models using the same tools.

By reducing the equation with the Schroder transformation to an auxiliary equation we discuss not only the constant alpha at resonance, that is, at a root of the unity, but also those alpha near resonance under the Bryuno condition.

Let lambda be the Liouville function defined by lambda(n) = (-1) (Omega(n)), where Omega(n) stands for the number of prime divisors of n counting their multiplicity. We prove that if q (nu) is a sequence of positive integers with a corresponding sequence of primitive real characters chi (nu) (mod q (nu) ) such that L(s, chi (nu) ) has a Siegel zero beta (nu) = 1 - 1/(eta (nu) log q (nu) ), eta (nu) > exp e(30), then there exist a positive constant c and a function epsilon(n) tending to 0 as n -> a and such that |h (lambda) (n)|/n a parts per thousand currency sign c/ log log eta (nu) + epsilon(n) uniformly for all n a [q (nu) (10) , q (nu) ((log log eta nu)/3) ] such that (n, q (nu) ) = 1.

The aim of the paper is to compare area level models and estimation methods for the fraction of the unemployed using simulation based on the Lithuanian Labor Force Survey data. The Fay-Herriot area level model, estimated by empirical best linear unbiased prediction, and the unmatched logit-normal-normal and binomial-logit-normal models, estimated using hierarchical Bayes analysis, are applied. Bayesian imputation is used for areas without sample data. We suggest the composition of some model elements.

We show that these processes can be treated as stable processes subordinated by the time process and also as Levy processes associated with generalized Levy processes in the sense of stable generalized convolution.
