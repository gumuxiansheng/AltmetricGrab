GENERALIZED KINDS OF DENSITY AND THE ASSOCIATED IDEALS	ACTA MATHEMATICA HUNGARICA			English	Article						generalized density; P-ideal; density ideal; Erdos-Ulam ideal	WEAK STATISTICAL CONVERGENCE; SEQUENCES; SPACES	We consider modified notions of natural density of subsets of w:= {0,1,... }. Namely, we introduce the density of the weight g : omega -> [0, infinity)where g(n) -> infinity and n/g(n) negated right arrow 0. Denote by G the set of all such functions g. We study the associated ideals (sic)(g,) g epsilon G of sets A subset of w with g-density zero. We show that (sic)(g) is an F-sigma delta P-ideal on omega. We give sufficient conditions for proper inclusions of type (sic)(g1) not subset of (sic)(g2). Also, we show examples where no inclusion between (sic)(g1) and (sic)(g2) holds. Finally, we prove that each ideal (sic)(g,) g epsilon G is a density ideal in the sense of Farah, and we infer that it cannot be of type F-sigma . It turns out that there is no inclusion between{(sic)(g) : g epsilon G} and the set of all Erdos-Ulam ideals.

Representing a monotone map by principal lattice congruences	ACTA MATHEMATICA HUNGARICA			English	Article						principal congruence; lattice congruence; ordered set; order; poset; quasi-colored lattice; preordering; quasiordering; monotone map		For a lattice L, let Princ (L) denote the ordered set of principal congruences of L. In a pioneering paper, G. Gratzer proved that bounded ordered sets (in other words, posets with 0 and 1) are, up to isomorphism, exactly the Princ (L) of bounded lattices L. Here we prove that for each 0-separating boundpreserving monotone map psi between two bounded ordered sets, there are a lattice L and a sublattice K of L such that, in essence, psi is the map from Princ (K) to Princ (L) that sends a principal congruence to the congruence it generates in the larger lattice.

II	ACTA MATHEMATICA HUNGARICA			English	Article						Pythagorean triple; exponential Diophantine equation; generalized Fermat equation; linear form in two logarithms		Jesmanowicz [7] conjectured that the exponential Diophantine equation (m(2) - n(2))(x) +(2mn)(y) = (m(2) + n(2))(z) has only one positive integer solution (x, y, z) = (2, 2, 2), where m and n are positive integers with m > n, gcd(m, n) = 1 and m not equivalent to n (mod 2). In [17], the second author showed that if n = 2, then Jesmanowicz' conjecture is true without any assumption on m. Let n be a positive integer satisfying n equivalent to 2 (mod 4) and m > 72n. We prove that if n satisfies at least one of three conditions (C-1) n/2 is a power of an odd prime, (C-2) n/2 has no prime factors congruent to 1 modulo 8, (C-3) n/2 is a square, then the conjecture is true. As a corollary, we derive that if n/2 is odd with n < 100, then the conjecture is true without any assumption on m.

COMPLETIONS OF UNIFORM PARTIAL FRAMES	ACTA MATHEMATICA HUNGARICA			English	Article						frame; uniform S-frame; uniform partial frame; sigma-frame; k-frame; meet-semilattice; complete; completion; compact; Samuel compactification; cozero; S-cozero; ideal; S-ideal; S-Lindelof; S-separable; selection function	SAMUEL COMPACTIFICATION	We address classical questions concerning the existence and properties of completions in a new context, namely, that of uniform partial frames. A partial frame is a meet-semilattice in which certain joins exist and finite meets distribute over these joins. We specify these joins by means of a so-called selection function, which must satisfy certain axioms to produce a useful theory. The axioms we use here were introduced in [9] and are sufficiently general to encompass in the resulting theory frames, -frames and -frames. Using covers to describe uniform structures on partial frames, we develop the notion of completeness for a uniform partial frame, using the frame-theoretic version of the well-known fact that a complete uniform space is isomorphic to any uniform space in which it is densely embedded. In constructing a completion, we make substantial use of the functor which takes -ideals and the functor which takes -cozero elements, as well as the category equivalence that these functors induce. Our strategy involves the transfer of important properties concerning the completion from the category of uniform frames to that of uniform partial frames. As a final application, we provide two constructions of the Samuel compactification. One involves the completion of the totally bounded coreflection; the other uses the functors mentioned above to transfer the corresponding compactification from uniform frames.

ERGODIC PROPERTIES OF NONHOMOGENEOUS MARKOV CHAINS DEFINED ON ORDERED BANACH SPACES WITH A BASE	ACTA MATHEMATICA HUNGARICA			English	Article						coefficient of ergodicity; weak ergodicity; L-weak ergodicity; nonhomogeneous Markov chain; norm ordered space; Doeblin's condition	WEAK ERGODICITY; COEFFICIENTS; SEMIGROUPS; RECURRENCE; OPERATORS; THEOREMS; MAPS	It is known that the Dobrushin's ergodicity coefficient is one of the effective tools to study the behavior of non-homogeneous Markov chains. In the present paper, we define such an ergodicity coefficient of a positive mapping defined on ordered Banach spaces with a base (OBSB), and study its properties. In terms of this coefficient we prove the equivalence uniform and weak ergodicities of homogeneous Markov chains. This extends earlier results obtained in case of von Neumann algebras. Such a result allows to establish a category theorem for uniformly ergodic Markov operators. We find necessary and sufficient conditions for the weak ergodicity of nonhomogeneous discrete Markov chains (NDMC). L-weak ergodicity of NDMC defined on OBSB is also studied. We establish that the chain satisfies L-weak ergodicity if and only if it satisfies a modified Doeblin's condition (D-1-condition). Moreover, some connections between L-weak ergodicity and L-strong ergodicity have been established. Several nontrivial examples of NDMC which satisfy the D-1-condition are provided.

The solutions form a linear space with respect to the usual pointwise operations. According to the classical results of the theory they must be generalized polynomials. New investigations have been started a few years ago. They clarified that the existence of non-trivial solutions depends on the algebraic properties of some related families of parameters. The problem is to find the necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of non-trivial solutions in terms of these kinds of properties. One of the earliest results is due to Z. Darczy [1]. It can be considered as the solution of the problem in case of n = 2. We are going to take more steps forward by solving the problem in case of n = 3.

We also investigate whether the HOMFLY-PT invariant and the Link Floer Homology are essential invariants, that is, we try to understand if these invariants are able to distinguish links in L(p, q) covered by the same link in S (3). In order to do so, we generalize the combinatorial definition of Knot Floer Homology in lens spaces developed in [2, 19] to the case of links and we analyze how both the invariants change when we switch the orientation of the link.

On weakly cyclic Z symmetric manifolds	ACTA MATHEMATICA HUNGARICA			English	Article						pseudo symmetric manifold; weakly Ricci symmetric manifold; pseudo Z symmetric manifold; weakly Z symmetric manifold; weakly cyclic Z symmetric manifold	RIEMANNIAN SPACES; CLASSIFICATION; HYPERSURFACES	The object of the present paper is to study weakly cyclic Z symmetric manifolds. Some geometric properties have been studied. We obtain a sufficient condition for a weakly cyclic Z symmetric manifold to be a quasi Einstein manifold. Next we consider conformally flat weakly cyclic Z symmetric manifolds. Then we study Einstein (WCZS) (n) (n > 2). Also we study decomposable (WCZS) (n) (n > 2). We prove the equivalency of semisymmetry and Weyl-semisymmetry in a (WCZS) (n) (n > 2). Finally, we give an example of a (WCZS)(4).	[De, U.

Abelian groups with isomorphic intersection graphs	ACTA MATHEMATICA HUNGARICA			English	Article						Abelian group; a conjecture of Zelinka; subgroup; number of cyclic subgroups; intersection graph		Let G be a group. The intersection graph of G is an undirected graph without loops and multiple edges defined as follows: the vertex set is the set of all proper nontrivial subgroups of G, and there is an edge between two distinct vertices X and Y if and only if where 1 denotes the trivial subgroup of G. It was conjectured in [3] that two (noncyclic) finite abelian groups with isomorphic intersection graphs are isomorphic. In this paper we study this conjecture and show that it is almost true. For any finite abelian group D let D (nc) be the product of all noncyclic Sylow subgroups of D. Our main result is that: given any two (nontrivial) finite abelian groups A and B, their intersection graphs and are isomorphic if and only if the groups A (nc) and B (nc) are isomorphic, and there is a bijection between the sets of (nontrivial) cyclic Sylow subgroups of A and B satisfying a certain condition. So, in particular, two finite abelian groups with isomorphic intersection graphs will be isomorphic provided that one of the groups has no (nontrivial) cyclic Sylow subgroup. Our methods are elementary.

Polynomial approximation with doubling weights	ACTA MATHEMATICA HUNGARICA			English	Article						weighted polynomial approximation; doubling weight; moduli of smoothness; degree of approximation	L(P); INEQUALITIES; SMOOTHNESS; MODULI; LP	A nonnegative function w is an element of L-1[-1,1] is called a doubling weight if there is a constant L such that w(2I) <= Lw(I), for all intervals I subset of [-1,1], where 2I denotes the interval having the same center as I and twice as large as I, and w(I) := integral(I) w(u) du. In this paper, we establish direct and inverse results for weighted approximation by algebraic polynomials in the L-p, 0 < p <= infinity, (quasi) norm weighted by w(n) := rho(n)(x)(-1) integral(x+rho n(x))(x-rho n(x)) w(u)du, where rho(n)(x):= n(-1) root 1-x(2)+n(-2) and w is a doubling weight. Among other things, we prove that, for a doubling weight w, 0 < p <= infinity, r is an element of N-0, and 0 < alpha < r + 1 - 1/lambda(p), we have (*) E-n(f)(p,wn) = O(n(-alpha)) double left right arrow omega phi(r+1) (f,n(-1))(p,wn) = O(n(-alpha)), where lambda(p) := p if 0 < p < infinity, lambda(p) := 1 if p = infinity, parallel to f parallel to(p,w) := (integral(1)(-1)|f(u)|(p)w(u)du)(1/p), parallel to f parallel to(infinity,w) := ess sup(u is an element of[- 1,1]) (|f(u)|w(u)), omega(r)(phi)(f,t)(p,w) := sup(0<h <= t) parallel to Delta(r)(h phi(.)) (f,.)parallel to(p,w), E-n(f)(p,w) := inf(Pn is an element of Pi n) parallel to f - P-n parallel to(p,w), and Pi(n) is the set of all algebraic polynomials of degree <= n - 1. We will also introduce classes of doubling weights W-delta,W-gamma with parameters delta, gamma >= 0 that are used to describe the behavior of w(n)(x)/w(m)(x) for m <= n. It turns out that every class W-delta,W-gamma with ((delta,gamma)) is an element of Gamma :- {(delta,gamma) is an element of R-2 | delta >= 1, gamma >= 0, delta + gamma >= 2} contains all doubling weights w, and for each pair (delta,gamma) is not an element of Gamma, there is a doubling weight not in W-delta,W-gamma. We will establish inverse theorems and equivalence results similar to (*) for doubling weights from classes W-delta,W-gamma. Using the fact that 1 is an element of W-0,W-0, we get the well known inverse results and equivalences of type (*) for unweighted polynomial approximation as an immediate corollary. Equivalence type results involving related K-functionals and realization type results (obtained as corollaries of our estimates) are also discussed. Finally, we mention that (*) closes a gap left in the paper by G. Mastroianni and V. Totik [13], where (*) was established for p = infinity and omega(r+2)(phi) f instead of omega(r+1)(phi) (it was shown there that, in general, (*) is not valid for p = infinity if omega(r+1)(phi) f is replaced by omega(r)(phi)).

Deformation of modules of weighted densities on the superspace	ACTA MATHEMATICA HUNGARICA			English	Article						cohomology; deformation; weighted densities; symbol	DIFFERENTIAL-OPERATORS; COHOMOLOGY	Over the (1,N)-dimensional real superspace, , we study non-trivial deformations of the natural action of the orthosymplectic Lie superalgebra on the direct sum of the superspaces of weighted densities. We compute the necessary and sufficient integrability conditions of a given infinitesimal deformation of this action and prove that any formal deformation is equivalent to its infinitisemal part. Likewise we study the same problem for the Lie superalgebra of contact vector fields instead of getting the same results. This work is the simplest generalization of a result by I. Basdouri and M.

SOME IDENTITIES INVOLVING THE PROUHET-THUE-MORSE SEQUENCE AND ITS RELATIVES	ACTA MATHEMATICA HUNGARICA			English	Article						Prouhet-Thue-Morse sequence; automatic sequence; sum of digits; identity	POWERS	Let s(k)(n) be the sum of digits of the expansion of the integer n in base k. Motivated by certain identities of Nieto, and Bateman and Bradley involving sums of the form Sigma(2n-1)(i=0) (-1)(s2(i)) (x + i)(m) for m = n and m = n+1, we consider the sequence of polynomials f(m, n)(u) (x) = Sigma(kn-1)(i=0) zeta(sk (i))(k) (x + u(i))(m). Here, the sequence u satisfies the recurrence relation u(ki + j) = P(u(i)) + jq for t = 0, 1,..., k - 1, and q is an element of V, where V is a finitely dimensional vector space over the field K and P : V -> V is a linear endomorphism. Moreover, zeta(k) not equal 1 is a k-th root of unity. We prove that computing the polynomials f(m, n)(u) is essentially equivalent with computing its constant term and we find an explicit formula for this number. This allows us to prove several interesting identities involving the sum of (binary) digits function. We also prove some related results which are of independent interests and can be seen as a further generalization of certain sums involving the Prouhet-Thue-Morse sequence.

In this paper we intend to give a comprehensive study of multivariate needle polynomials. Even in the univariate case there is an essential difference between the sharpness of the corresponding needles at the inner and boundary points. This phenomenon becomes more intricate in the multivariate case. We will show that the sharpness of multivariate needle polynomials at the boundary points of convex bodies is closely related to the geometry of the boundary at the corresponding points. This will be accomplished for both ordinary and homogeneous multivariate polynomials. Finally, we shall discuss how properties of needle polynomials can be applied in the study of norming sets (optimal meshes) and cubature formulas.

Several different characterizations of the component of 0 in C (r) (X) are given and using these characterizations, it turns out that C (r) (X) is totally disconnected if and only if the set of non-almost P-points of beta X is dense in beta X. It is also shown that C (r) (X) is connected or locally connected if and only if X is a pseudocompact almost P-space. We observe that most of the familiar forms of compactness and most of the countability properties of C (r) (X) are equivalent to the finiteness of X. Finally, open and closed ideals in C (r) (X) are investigated and it is proved that for every , cl (r) O (p) = M (p) if and only if X is an almost P-space.	[Azarpanah, F.; Paimann, M.; Salehi, A.

Exact Kronecker constants of three element sets	ACTA MATHEMATICA HUNGARICA			English	Article						Kronecker constant; trigonometric approximation	EPSILON-KRONECKER; ABELIAN-GROUPS; I-0 SETS	For any three element set of positive integers, {a, b, n}, with a < b < n, n sufficiently large and gcd(a, b) = 1, we find the least alpha such that given any real numbers t(1), t(2), t(3) there is a real number x such that max{< ax-t(1)>, < bx -t(2)>, < nx -t(3)>} <= alpha, where <.> denotes the distance to the nearest integer. The number alpha is known as the angular Kronecker constant of {a, b, n}. We also find the least beta such that the same inequality holds with upper bound beta when we consider only approximating t(1), t(2), t(3) is an element of {0, 1/2}, the so-called binary Kronecker constant. The answers are complicated and depend on the congruence of n mod (a + b). Surprisingly, the angular and binary Kronecker constants agree except if n equivalent to a(2) mod (a + b).	[Hare, K.

On ideals and primeness in the generalised group near-ring	ACTA MATHEMATICA HUNGARICA			English	Article						near-ring; module; monogenic; ideal; prime		Le Riche, Meldrum and Van der Walt introduced the concept of a group near-ring. Thereafter, starting with an ideal in the base near-ring, they constructed two corresponding ideals in the group near-ring. Furthermore, by starting with an ideal in the group near-ring, they constructed a corresponding ideal in the base near-ring. In this we paper, we generalise both the concept of the group near-ring and the construction of the three ideals. We introduce a fourth ideal, and we investigate some relationships amongst these four ideals. We also investigate whether a prime condition placed on an R-ideal of a near-ring module implies that prime condition on the corresponding ideal in the generalised group near-ring and vice versa.

Connectivity and other invariants of generalized products of graphs	ACTA MATHEMATICA HUNGARICA			English	Article						connectivity; direct product; lexicographic product; circle times(h)-product; o(h)	DOMINATION NUMBER	Figueroa-Centeno et al. [4] introduced the following product of digraphs let D be a digraph and let be a family of digraphs such that V (F) = V for every . Consider any function . Then the product is the digraph with vertex set and if and only if and . In this paper, we deal with the undirected version of the -product, which is a generalization of the classical direct product of graphs and, motivated by the -product, we also recover a generalization of the classical lexicographic product of graphs, namely the -product, that was introduced by Sabidussi in 1961. We provide two characterizations for the connectivity of that generalize the existing one for the direct product. For , we provide exact formulas for the connectivity and the edge-connectivity, under the assumption that V (F) = V , for all . We also introduce some miscellaneous results about other invariants in terms of the factors of both, the -product and the -product. Some of them are easily obtained from the corresponding product of two graphs, but many others generalize the existing ones for the direct and the lexicographic product, respectively. We end up the paper by presenting some structural properties. An interesting result in this direction is a characterization for the existence of a nontrivial decomposition of a given graph G in terms of -product.	[Lopez, S.

It is proved that under MA CH any compact space of weight is a retract of a compact maximal pseudocompact space. If kappa is strictly smaller than the first weakly inaccessible cardinal, then the Tychonoff cube [0, 1](kappa) is maximal countably compact. However, for a measurable cardinal kappa, the Tychonoff cube of weight kappa is not even embeddable in a maximal countably compact space. We also show that if X is a maximal countably compact space, then the functional tightness of X is countable. It is independent of ZFC whether every compact space of countable tightness must be maximal countably compact. On the other hand, any countably compact space X with the Mazur property ( every real-valued sequentially continuous function on X is continuous) must be maximal countably compact. We prove that for any omega-monolithic compact space X, if C (p) (X) has the Mazur property, then it is a Fr,chet-Urysohn space.	[Tkachuk, V. V.; Wilson, R.

Inspired by their method, we use a hybrid approach to characterize all power integral bases in the pth cyclotomic field Q(zeta(p)) for the regular primes p = 29, 31, 41. For each prime p this involves solving a system of (p-1)/2 multivariate polynomial equations of degree (p - 1)/2 in (p - 1)/2 variables over the finite field Z/pZ.

We show that this local ring can be represented by a matrix ring and any module over S is a direct sum of cyclic submodules. The ring S appears in Problem 2.45 of Dniester Notebook. For two such rings S-1 and S-2 we deal with left-right (S-1, S-2) bimodules. A certain factor ring of a skew polynomial ring over a Galois ring is also considered. This factor ring is isomorphic to a full matrix ring over some Galois ring.

Veldsman's classes of associative rings	ACTA MATHEMATICA HUNGARICA			English	Article						ideals; left ideals; filial rings; left filial rings; Veldsman's classes	LEFT FILIAL RINGS; CLASSIFICATION; SUBIDEMPOTENT; IDEALS	The relation of being an ideal (left ideal, right ideal) of a ring is not transitive. Rings for which the transitivity does hold are called filial (left filial, right filial). In symbols, these are rings R such that if A alpha B and B alpha R then A alpha R, where alpha is the respective relation. In [24] Veldsman introduced for each triple (alpha, beta, gamma) of these relations the class of rings R which satisfy: if A alpha B and B beta R then A gamma R. He found some relationships among so defined classes and characterized rings in each of them. Our aim in this paper is to study the structure of rings in these classes. We observe that one can select three from among them, which are fundamental in the sense that results obtained for them together with those known for left filial rings, give structure theorems for rings in all classes. Then we study the structure of rings in so selected three classes. Our main results concern the prime and generalized nil radicals of such rings and reduced rings in these classes. We also get many related results and ask several questions.	[Nowakowska, M.] Univ Silesia, Inst Math, PL-40007 Katowice, Poland; [Puczyowski, E.

The relation between this structure theorem and the theorem on completely regular semigroups by Lallement is also illustrated. The structure of some special types of completely regular semigroups is also described as fundamental semilattices of completely simple semigroups.

On certain Mahler functions	ACTA MATHEMATICA HUNGARICA			English	Article						algebraic independence of functions; hypertranscendence; transcendence and algebraic independence of numbers	ALGEBRAIC INDEPENDENCE; VALUES; SERIES	A few years ago, Pellarin introduced a new sequence of functions each one being holomorphic in the unit disc and satisfying a Mahler-type functional equation. It will be shown that every single function is hypertranscendental. Moreover, a certain subsequence consisting of functions that are algebraically independent over is exhibited, and all other functions are -linear combinations of these modulo . Mahler's method allows to deduce the corresponding arithmetic analogs from these analytic facts.

Denote by the set of possible degree sequences of a labeled tree on n nodes. Let D (n) be a random variable on and T(D (n) ) be a uniform random labeled tree with degree sequence D (n) .

Then it is shown that this convergence result can not be improved in the Pringsheim sense, that is, L log(+) L is the maximal convergence space for sigma(1,1)(n,m) when there are no conditions for the indices except that they tend to infinity. We prove that for all measurable functions delta : left perpendicular0,delta) -> left perpendicular0,infinity) for which lim(t ->infinity)delta(t) = 0 there is a function f is an element of Llog(+) L delta(L) with lim sup vertical bar sigma(2n1,2n2) f(x)vertical bar = +infinity a.e as min{n(1), n(2)} -> 8.
