Interpolation Hilbert Spaces Between Sobolev Spaces	RESULTS IN MATHEMATICS			English	Article						Sobolev space; interpolation space; Hormander space; OR-varying function; interpolation with a function parameter	FUNCTION PARAMETER; BESOV-SPACES	We explicitly describe all Hilbert function spaces that are interpolation spaces with respect to a given couple of Sobolev inner product spaces considered over R-n or a half-space in R-n or a bounded Euclidean domain with Lipschitz boundary. We prove that these interpolation spaces form a subclass of isotropic Hormander spaces. They are parametrized with a radial function parameter which is OR-varying at +infinity and satisfies some additional conditions. We give explicit examples of intermediate but not interpolation spaces.

Firstly, we prove that if M (n) is compact and satisfies some pointwise pinching condition, and assume further that the ambient space has pure curvature tensor and non-negative isotropic curvature, then the Betti numbers beta (p) (M) = 0 for 2 a parts per thousand currency sign p a parts per thousand currency sign n-2. Secondly, suppose that M (n) is a complete non-compact submanifold in the Euclidean space with finite total curvature in the sense that its traceless second fundament form has finite L (n) -norm, then we show that the spaces of L (2) harmonic p-forms on M (n) have finite dimensions for all 2 a parts per thousand currency sign p a parts per thousand currency sign n-2.

Further let G(tau) = H proportional to(tau) K be the semi-direct product of H and K with respect to the continuous homomorphism . This paper presents a unified approach for the partial Fourier analysis on G(tau) - H proportional to(tau) K, when K is Abelian. The tau-dual group (partial dual group) G((tau) over cap) of G(tau) is defined as the semi-direct product group H ((tau) over cap)w (K) over cap where (tau) over cap : H -> Aut((K) over cap) is given via (tau) over caph(omega) : = omega omicron tau(h)-1 for all h is an element of H and omega is an element of(K) over cap We will prove a Pontrjagin duality theorem and we introduce a unitary partial Fourier transform on G(tau). As examples, we shall study these techniques for some well-known semi-direct product groups.

A positive answer in some senses to a problem on the pointwise approximation power of linear operators on equidistant nodes posed by Gavrea, Gonska and Kacs is given. Direct and converse results, computational aspects and Gruss-type inequalities are also proved.

J	Olbrys, A; Szostok, T				Olbrys, Andrzej; Szostok, Tomasz			Inequalities of the Hermite-Hadamard Type Involving Numerical Differentiation Formulas	RESULTS IN MATHEMATICS			English	Article						Hermite-Hadamard inequality; differentiation formulas; convex functions		We observe that the Hermite-Hadamard inequality written in the form f (x + y/2) <= F(y) - F(x)/y - x <= f(x) + f(y)/2 may be viewed as an inequality between two quadrature operators f (x+y/2) f(x)+ f(y)/2 and a differentiation formula F(y)-F(x)/y-x. We extend this inequality, replacing the middle term by more complicated ones. As it turns out in some cases it suffices to use Ohlin lemma as it was done in a recent paper (Rajba, Math Inequal Appl 17(2):557-571, 2014) however to get more interesting result some more general tool must be used. To this end we use Levin-Steckin theorem which provides necessary and sufficient conditions under which inequalities of the type we consider are satisfied.

Multiple Completeness of the Root Functions for a Certain Class of Pencils of Ordinary Differential Operators with Constant Coefficients	RESULTS IN MATHEMATICS			English	Article						Pencil of ordinary differential operators; root functions; multiple completeness; polynomial pencil of operators; system of root functions; eigenfunctions; associated functions		A class of polynomial pencils of ordinary differential operators with constant coefficients is considered in the article. The pencils from this class are generated by the n-th order ordinary differential expression and two-point boundary conditions. Coefficients of the differential expression are supposed to be polynomials of the spectral parameter with constant coefficients. The boundary conditions are supposed to depend on the spectral parameter polynomially. It is assumed that the roots of the characteristic equation of the pencils from this class are simple, non-zero and lie on two rays emanating from the origin. The author investigates n-fold completeness of the root functions of the pencils from this class in the space of summable with square functions on the main segment. Sufficient conditions of the n-fold completeness of the root functions are obtained. The main idea of the method of the proof of the theorem is a new asymptotics of the characteristic determinant of the pencil. The presented results supplement previous results of the author.

By introducing a new parametrization we find that the generalized Cayley hypersurfaces are improper affine hypersphere with flat affine metric and vanishing Pick invariant, whose difference tensor K satisfies del((alpha)) K = 0 and Kn-1 not equal 0, where the affine alpha-connection del((alpha)) of information geometry is first introduced on affine hypersurface for each alpha is an element of R. As main result, we establish a characterization of the generalized Cayley hypersurfaces by the last two properties for some nonzero constant alpha.

By the combination of Painleve test and power series method, the Painleve property is considered under the specific condition. Then, by the truncated expansion, the classical Riccati equation is reduced to a linear second-order ordinary differential equation. Furthermore, we give the exact analytic solution to the generalized Riccati equation, and the analytic solution to the classical Riccati equation is presented successively.

INEQUALITY; SLANT SUBMANIFOLDS; CHEN INEQUALITIES; CR SUBMANIFOLDS; SHAPE OPERATOR; SPACE-FORMS; IMMERSIONS	Pursuing an idea motivated by a question of S.-S. Chern from 1968 on the existence of intrinsic Riemannian obstructions to minimality [Chern, S.-S.: Minimal submanifolds in a Riemannian manifold (1968)], an important study of the very idea of curvature was deepened after 1993 by B.-Y. Chen, then by other authors. In the last two decades, B.-Y. Chen's fundamental inequalities have been investigated by many authors in the context of various geometric structures. In this work, we start by presenting B.-Y. Chen's fundamental inequality for Kahler submanifolds in complex space forms, and we recall why the case of Kahler surfaces in C-3 satisfying scal(p) = 4inf sce(pi(r)) appears naturally and is important. Then we provide several characterizations of strongly minimal complex surfaces in the complex three dimensional space. We focus our study on the question of finding further examples of strongly minimal Kahler surfaces, as the question of a complete classification of these geometric objects is still open.

In particular, it is shown that in the balanced autonomous case f(u) = u - u(3), no such stable stationary solution can exist on any finite graph.

Complete Hypersurfaces with Two Distinct Principal Curvatures in a Space Form	RESULTS IN MATHEMATICS			English	Article						Space forms; mean curvature; normalized scalar curvature; isoparametric hypersurfaces; totally umbilical hypersurfaces	LINEAR WEINGARTEN HYPERSURFACES; CONSTANT SCALAR CURVATURE; MINIMAL HYPERSURFACES; RIEMANNIAN-MANIFOLDS	In this paper, we study complete hypersurfaces M-n immersed in a space form Q(c)(n+1), with c is an element of {-1, 0, 1} and n >= 2, having two distinct principal curvatures with multiplicity p and n - p. In the case that such a hypersurface M-n has constant mean curvature, under a suitable restriction on the traceless part of its second fundamental form, we apply a Simons-type formula jointly with the well known generalized maximum principle of Omori-Yau to show that M-n must be either isometric to Sn-p(r) x H-p(-root 1 + r(2)), when c = -1, Sn-p(r) x R-p, when c = 0, or Sn-p(r) x S-p(-root 1 - r(2)), when c = 1. Afterwards, we use a Cheng-Yau modified operator in order to obtain a sort of extension of this previous result for the context of linear Weingarten hypersurfaces, that is, hypersurfaces whose mean and scalar curvatures are linearly related.

This analysis presupposes multiple characterizations of each quasivariety involved in order to establish their relationship, and in particular to prove that all the joins are obtained by means of subdirect products.									5	1	1	0	0	SPRINGER BASEL AG	BASEL	PICASSOPLATZ 4, BASEL, 4052, SWITZERLAND	1422-6383	1420-9012		RESULTS MATH	Results Math.

The boundary conditions of this problem are periodic-antiperiodic boundary conditions and it is well known that they are regular but not strongly regular. Asymptotic formulae for eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the considered boundary value problem are established. Under the condition it is proved that all the eigenvalues (except for finite number) are simple, where . Furthermore, we prove that the system of root functions of this spectral problem forms a basis in the space , when . Also, it is shown that this basis is unconditional for p = 2.

Some more subtle properties are established. Then we study the properties of g-Riesz bases and g-orthonormal bases in Hilbert spaces. Especially we establish certain uniqueness on the dual g-frames of them. By using the disjoint g-frames as tools, we show that g-frame has a unique dual g-frame if and only if it is a g-Riesz basis. We also show that a normalized tight g-frame has a unique normalized tight dual g-frame, i.e., itself.

Until now these question have only been discussed under special assumptions (for example in [7] and [11]). In particular, little is known on extensions of derivations. The result is in each case a criterion for extendability (Lemmata 3.2 and 4.3). The characterization of all extensions of automorphisms sigma from K to Q is well understood (Corollary 3.5 and Theorem 3.12). This is in contrast to the characterization of the extensions of sigma-derivations , which can only be described satisfactorily under additional assumptions (Theorems 4.8, 4.9, 4.10). We obtain the set of all extensions of sigma or easily from a particular extension and the normalizer or (Corollaries 3.3 and 4.4). These normalizers will be described in Sect. 2 by minimal elements of R.

A natural generalization of Paley-Wiener spaces is obtained by substituting the Fourier kernel with an analytic Hilbert-space-valued kernel K. Thus we obtain a reproducing kernel Hilbert space H-K of entire functions in which the Kramer property allows to prove a sampling theorem. A necessary and sufficient condition ensuring that this sampling formula can be written as a Lagrange-type interpolation series concerns the stability under removal of a finite number of zeros of the functions belonging to the space H-K; this is the so-called zero-removing property. This work is devoted to the study of the zero-removing property in H-K spaces, regardless of the Kramer property, revealing its connections with other mathematical fields.	[Garcia, A.

On Regular Solutions of the Generalized Dhombres Equation II	RESULTS IN MATHEMATICS			English	Article						Iterative functional equation; invariant curves; real solutions; regular solutions; topological entropy; periodic orbits	FUNCTIONAL-EQUATION	We consider continuous solutions f: R+ -> R+ = (0, infinity) of the functional equation f(xf(x)) = phi(f(x)) where phi is a given continuous map from R+ to R+. A solution f is singular if there are a and b such that 0 < a <= b < infinity, f vertical bar((0,a)) > 1, f vertical bar([a,b]) equivalent to 1, and f vertical bar((b,infinity)) < 1; all other solutions are regular. It is known that the range R-f of a singular solution can contain, for every positive integer n, a periodic point of phi of period n. In this paper we show that the range of a regular solution f contains no periodic point of phi of period different from 1 and 2. Our proof is essentially based on a recent result that, for regular solutions phi vertical bar(Rf) has zero topological entropy. Since there are regular solutions containing periodic points of period 2 in the range, we get the best possible result.

J	Wang, Y; Zhao, GS				Wang, Yu; Zhao, Guosong			Homogeneous Einstein Metrics on Certain Generalized Flag Manifolds with Six Isotropy Summands	RESULTS IN MATHEMATICS			English	Article						Generalized flag manifolds; Einstein metric; isotropy representation; symmetric t-triples		For a generalized flag manifold M = G/K of a compact connected simple Lie group G whose isotropy representation decomposes into more than five isotropy summands, there are only a few results about the homogeneous Einstein metrics on M. Finding the invariant Einstein metrics on generalized flag manifolds, there are two difficulties. One is computing the non-zero structure constants, the other is computing the Grobner basis of the system of Einstein equations. In this paper, we give a method (Theorem A) which can be used to calculate structure constants of generalized flag manifolds with any number of isotropy summands. In this direction we present invariant Einstein metrics on some flag manifolds of exceptional groups with six isotropy summands.
