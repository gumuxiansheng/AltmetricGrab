In this paper, some algebraic and geometrical properties of the k-numerical range of P(A) are investigated. In particular, the relationship between the k-numerical range of P(A) and the k-numerical range of its companion linearization is stated.

First, we characterize one-sided submodules of M-m x n(D) in terms of left row reduced echelon or right column reduced echelon matrices with entries from D. Next, we introduce the notion of a nest module of matrices with entries from D. We then characterize submodules of nest modules of matrices over D in terms of certain finite sequences of left row reduced echelon or right column reduced echelon matrices with entries from D. We use this result to characterize principal submodules of nest modules. We also describe subbimodules of nest modules of matrices. As a consequence, we characterize (one-sided) ideals of nest algebras of matrices over division rings.	[Rahimi-Alangi, M.] Payame Noor Univ, Dept Math, POB 19395-3697, Tehran, Iran; [Yahaghi, B.

The total domination number of a graph G, denoted by gamma(t)(G), is the minimum cardinality of a total dominating set of G. Chellali and Haynes [Total and paired domination numbers of a tree, AKCE International Journal of Graphs and Combinatorics 1 (2004), 69-75] established the following upper bound on the total domination number of a tree in terms of the order and the number of support vertices, gamma(t)(T) <= (n + s)/2. We characterize all trees attaining this upper bound.

Let T-n(R, sigma) be the skew triangular matrix ring over a local ring R where a is an endomorphism of R. We show that T-2(R, sigma) is strongly clean if and only if for any a is an element of 1 + J(R),b is an element of J(R), l(a) - r(sigma(b)) : R -> R is surjective. Further, T-3(R, sigma) is strongly clean if l(a) - r(sigma(b)), l(a) - r(sigma 2(b)) and l(b) - r(sigma(a)) are surjective for any a is an element of U(R), b is an element of J(R).

In this note we show that if X is a monotonically normal T-1-space with countable pseudocharacter and X has a sigma-discrete dense subspace D, then X is a Baire space if and only if X is Volterra. We show that if X is a metacompact normal sequential T-1-space and X has a sigma-closed discrete dense subset, then X is a Baire space if and only if X is Volterra. If X is a generalized ordered (GO) space and has a sigma-closed discrete dense subset, then X is a Baire space if and only if X is Volterra. And also some known results are generalized.	[Peng, L.

For the corresponding problem, the backward finite differences method with suitable grid size is applied. It is shown that if the coefficients satisfy some special conditions, this algorithm not only is convergent, but also is conditionally stable. Moreover, it is proved that the estimated values converge to the exact solution of the problem. All these approaches examined in some numerical examples. corresponding theorems for the convergency and stability of the solution are studied.

AUTOMATIC CONTINUITY OF ALMOST MULTIPLICATIVE MAPS BETWEEN FRECHET ALGEBRAS	BULLETIN OF THE IRANIAN MATHEMATICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						Automatic continuity; Frechet algebras; Q-algebras; almost multiplicative maps; weakly almost multiplicative maps; dense range almost multiplicative maps		For Frechet algebras (A, (p(n))) and (B, (q(n))), a linear map T : A -> B is almost multiplicative with respect to (p(n)) and (q(n)), if there exists epsilon >= 0 such that q(n)(Tab - TaTb) <= epsilon p(n)(a)p(n)(b), for all n is an element of N, a, b is an element of A, and it is called weakly almost multiplicative with respect to (pa) and (q(n)), if there exists epsilon >= 0 such that for every k is an element of N, there exists n(k) is an element of N, satisfying the inequality q(k)(Tab - TaTb) <= epsilon p(n(k))(a)P-n(k)(b), for all a, b is an element of A. We investigate the automatic continuity of (weakly) almost multiplicative maps between certain classes of Frechet algebras, such as Banach algebras and Frechet Q-algebras. We also obtain some results on the automatic continuity of dense range (weakly) almost multiplicative maps between Frechet algebras.	[Honary, T. Ghasemi; Omidi, M.; Sanatpour, A.

Recently, several types of the preconditioners have been applied for ameliorating the rate of convergence of the Accelerated Overrelaxation (AOR) method. In this paper, we study the applicability of a general class of the preconditioned iterative methods under certain conditions. More precisely, it is demonstrated that the preconditioned Mixed-Type Splitting (MTS) iterative methods can surpass the preconditioned AOR iterative methods for an entirely general class of preconditioners handled by Wang and Song [J. Comput. Appl. Math. 226 (2009), no. 1, 114-124]. Finally some numerical results are elaborated which confirm the validity of the established results.	[Beik, F. Panjeh Ali; Shams, N.

We study strongly z-ideals, their relation with z-ideals and the role of spatiality in this relation. For strongly z-ideals, we analyze prime ideals using the concept of zero sets. Moreover, it is proven that the intersection of all zero sets of a prime ideal of C(L), which is ring of real-valued continuous functions for frame L, does not have more than one element. Also, z-filters are introduced in terms of pointfree topology. Then the relationship between z-filters and ideals, particularly maximal ideals, is examined. Finally, it is shown that the family of all zero sets is a base for the collection of closed sets.	[Estaji, A. A.; Abedi, M.] Hakim Sabzevari Univ, Fac Math & Comp Sci, Sabzevar, Iran; [Feizabadi, A.

Not much is known about the behavior of the classes of bi-univalent functions let alone about their coefficients. In this paper we use the Faber polynomial expansions to find coefficient estimates for four well-known classes of bi-univalent functions which are defined by subordinations. Both the coefficient bounds and the techniques presented are new and we hope that this paper will inspire future researchers in applying our approach to other related problems.	[Hamidi, S.

The method is a combination of the asymptotic expansion technique and the reproducing kernel method (RKM). First an asymptotic expansion for the solution of the given singularly perturbed delayed boundary value problem is constructed. Then the reduced regular delayed differential equation is solved analytically using the RKM. An error estimate and two numerical examples are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the present method. The results of numerical examples show that the present method is accurate and efficient.	[Geng, F. Z.; Qian, S.

For this, we uniformly approximate absolute value in such a way that the nonsmooth absolute value equation can be formulated as a smooth nonlinear equation. By solving the parametric smooth nonlinear equation using Newton method, for a decreasing sequence of parameters, we can get the solution of absolute value equation. It is proved that the method is globally convergent under some weaker conditions with respect to existing methods. Moreover, preliminary numerical results indicate effectiveness and robustness of our method to solve absolute value equation.

It is shown that any finite-dimensional indecomposable g-module is a module for a finite-dimensional quotient of the universal enveloping superalgebra of g. These quotient superalgebras are called the generalized reduced enveloping superalgebras, which generalize the notion of reduced enveloping superalgebras. Properties and representations of these generalized reduced enveloping superalgebras are studied. Moreover, each such superalgebra can be identified as a reduced enveloping superalgebra of the associated restricted Lie superalgebra.	[Yao, Y.

ON RESIDUATED LATTICES WITH UNIVERSAL QUANTIFIERS	BULLETIN OF THE IRANIAN MATHEMATICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						residuated lattice; universal quantifier; m-filter		We consider properties of residuated lattices with universal quantifier and show that, for a residuated lattice X, (X, for all) is a residuated lattice with a quantifier if and only if there is an m-relatively complete substructure of X. We also show that, for a strong residuated lattice boolean AND{p(lambda) vertical bar P-lambda is an m - filter} = {1} and hence that any strong residuated lattice is a subdirect product of a strong residuated lattice with a universal quantifier {X/P-lambda}, where P-lambda is a prime m-filter. As a corollary of this result, we prove that every strong monadic MTL-algebra (BL- and MV-algebra) is a subdirect product of linearly ordered strong monadic MTL-algebras (BL- and MV-algebras, respectively).

SUZUKI-TYPE FIXED POINT THEOREMS FOR GENERALIZED CONTRACTIVE MAPPINGS THAT CHARACTERIZE METRIC COMPLETENESS	BULLETIN OF THE IRANIAN MATHEMATICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						Banach contraction principle; Contractive mappings; Fixed points; Suzuki-type fixed point theorem; Metric completeness	ASYMPTOTIC CONTRACTIONS; SPACES; PRINCIPLE; CONSTANTS	Inspired by the work of Suzuki in [T. Suzuki, A generalized Banach contraction principle that characterizes metric completeness, Proc. Amer. Math. Soc., 136 (2008), 1861-1869], we prove a fixed point theorem for contractive mappings that generalizes a theorem of Geraghty in [M.A. Geraghty, On contractive mappings, Proc. Amer. Math. Soc., 40 (1973), 604-608] and characterizes metric completeness. We introduce the family A of all nonnegative functions 0 with the property that, given a metric space (X, d) and a mapping T: X --> X, the condition x,y is an element of X, x not equal y, d(x, Tx) <= d(x, y) double right arrow d(Tx, Ty) < phi(d(x, y)), implies that the iterations x(n) = T-n x, for any choice of initial point x is an element of X, form a Cauchy sequence in X. We show that the family of L-functions, introduced by Lim in [T.C. Lim, On characterizations of Meir-Keeler contractive maps, Nonlinear Anal., 46 (2001), 113-120], and the family of test functions, introduced by Geraghty, belong to A. We also prove a Suzuki-type fixed point theorem for nonlinear contractions.

We show that every analytic extension of a nth roots of M-hyponormal operator is subscalar of order 2k+2n. As a consequence, we get that if the spectrum of such operator T has a nonempty interior in C, then T has a nontrivial invariant subspace. Finally, we show that the sum of a nth roots of M-hyponormal operator and an algebraic operator of order k which are commuting is subscalar of order 2kn + 2.

We present some new theoretical results of these methods such as computable exact expressions and upper bounds for the norm of the error and residual. In particular, the obtained upper bounds for the Gl-FOM method help us to predict the behavior of the Frobenius norm of the Gl-FOM residual. We also explore the worst-case convergence behavior of these methods. Finally, some numerical experiments are given to show the performance of the theoretical results.	[Moghadam, M.

THE METRIC DIMENSION AND GIRTH OF GRAPHS	BULLETIN OF THE IRANIAN MATHEMATICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						Resolving set; metric dimension; girth		A set W subset of V(G) is called a resolving set for G, if for each two distinct vertices u, v is an element of V(G) there exists w is an element of W such that d(u, w) not equal d(v, w), where d(x, y) is the distance between the vertices x and y. The minimum cardinality of a resolving set for G is called the metric dimension of G, and denoted by dim(G). In this paper, it is proved that in a connected graph G of order n which has a cycle, dim(G) <= n - g(G) + 2, where g(G) is the length of the shortest cycle in G, and the equality holds if and only if G is a cycle, a complete graph or a complete bipartite graph K-s,K-t, s,t >= 2.

STOCHASTIC DIFFERENTIAL INCLUSIONS OF SEMIMONOTONE TYPE IN HILBERT SPACES	BULLETIN OF THE IRANIAN MATHEMATICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						Stochastic differential inclusions; Stochastic set-valued integrals; Generalized solutions; Semimonotone and hemicontinuous set-valued process	EVOLUTION-EQUATIONS; INTEGRALS; STABILITY	In this paper, we study the existence of generalized solutions for the infinite dimensional nonlinear stochastic differential inclusions dx(t) is an element of F(t,x(t))dt + G(t,x(t))dW(t) in which the multifunction F is semimonotone and hemicontinuous and the operator-valued multifunction G satisfies a Lipschitz condition. We define the Ito stochastic integral of operator set-valued stochastic processes with respect to the cylindrical Brownian motion on separable Hilbert spaces. Then, we generalize the existence results for differential inclusions in [H. Abedi and R. Jahanipur, Nonlinear differential inclusions of semimonotone and condensing type in Hilbert spaces, Bull.

ON CONSTANT PRODUCTS OF ELEMENTS IN SKEW POLYNOMIAL RINGS	BULLETIN OF THE IRANIAN MATHEMATICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						Constant products; skew polynomial rings; reversible rings; weakly 2-primal rings		Let R be a reversible ring which is a-compatible for an endomorphism alpha of R and f(X) = a(0) + a(1)X + ... + a(n) X-n be a nonzero skew polynomial in R[X; alpha]. It is proved that if there exists a nonzero skew polynomial g(X) = b(0) + b(1)X + ... + b(m)X(m) in R[X; alpha] such that 9(X) f (X) = c is a constant in R, then b(0)a(0) = c and there exist nonzero elements a and r in R such that r f(X) = ac. In particular, r = ab(p) for some p, 0 <= p <= m, and a is either one or a product of at most m coefficients from f (X). Furthermore, if b(0) is a unit in R, then a(1),a(2), ..., a(n) are all nilpotent. As an application of the above result, it is proved that if R is a weakly 2-primal ring which is a-compatible for an endomorphism a of R, then a skew polynomial f(X) in R[X; alpha] is a unit if and only if its constant term is a unit in R and other coefficients are all nilpotent.

Then we prove that some basic curvature tensors of W-n, are preserved by such a conformal mapping if and only if the covector field of the mapping is locally a gradient. Also, we obtained the relation between the scalar curvatures of the Weyl manifolds related by a conformal mapping preserving the Einstein tensor with a gradient covector field. Then, we prove that a Weyl manifold W-n, and a flat Weyl manifold (W) over tilde (n), which are in a conformal correspondence preserving the Einstein tensor are Einstein-Weyl manifolds. Moreover, we show that an isotropic Weyl manifold is an Einstein-Weyl manifold with zero scalar curvature and we obtain that a Weyl manifold W-n, and an isotropic Weyl manifold related by the conformal mapping preserving the Einstein tensor are Einstein-Weyl manifolds.

The conjugacy classes are determined using the coset analysis technique. Then we determine the inertia factor groups and Fischer matrices, which are required for the computations of the character table of (G) over bar (4) by means of Clifford-Fischer Theory. There are two inertia factor groups namely H-1 = Sp(8, 2) and H-2 = 2(7) :Sp(6, 2), the Schur multiplier and hence the character table of the corresponding covering group of H-2 were calculated. Using the information on conjugacy classes, Fischer matrices and ordinary and projective tables of H-2, we concluded that we only need to use the ordinary character table of H-2 to construct the character table of (G) over bar (4). The Fischer matrices of (G) over bar (4) are all listed in this paper. The character table of (G) over bar (4) is a 195 x 195 complex valued matrix, it has been supplied in the PhD Thesis [2] of the first author, which could be accessed online.	[Basheer, A. B.

By this iterative algorithm, the solvability of the problem can be determined automatically. When the matrix equation is consistent over a generalized (P, Q)-reflexive matrix X, a generalized (P, Q)-reflexive solution can be obtained within finite iteration steps in the absence of roundoff errors, and the least Frobenius norm generalized (P, Q)reflexive solution can be obtained by choosing an appropriate initial iterative matrix. Furthermore, the optimal approximate generalized (P, Q)-reflexive solution to a given matrix X-0 can be derived by finding the least Frobenius norm generalized (P, Q)-reflexive solution of a new corresponding quaternion matrix equation. Finally, two numerical examples are given to illustrate the efficiency of the proposed methods.

We assume that the liquid surplus of the company in the absence of control is modeled by the diffusion model. It is a hot topic to maximize the expected present value of dividends payout minus equity issuance until the time of bankruptcy. We study this problem under consideration of the time value of ruin. By constructing two categories of suboptimal models, one with classical model without equity issuance, and the other which never goes bankrupt by equity issuance, the optimal problem is addressed. At the end, some numerical examples and interesting economic interpretations are presented.

The relation between the delta-approximate spectrum and the usual spectrum is investigated. Also, an analogue of the classical Gleason-Kahane-Zelazko theorem is established: For each epsilon > 0, there is delta > 0 such that if phi is a linear functional with phi(a) is an element of sigma delta(a) for all a is an element of A, then phi is epsilon-almost multiplicative. Finally, we use these ideas to provide a sufficient condition for a delta-almost multiplicative functional to be multiplicative.

ON THE ORIENTED PERFECT PATH DOUBLE COVER CONJECTURE	BULLETIN OF THE IRANIAN MATHEMATICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						Perfect path double cover; Oriented perfect path double cover; Oriented cycle double cover		An oriented perfect path double cover (OPPDC) of a graph G is a collection of directed paths in the symmetric orientation G(s) of G such that each arc of G(s) lies in exactly one of the paths and each vertex of G appears just once as a beginning and just once as an end of a path. Maxova and Nesetril (Discrete Math. 276 (2004) 287-294) conjectured that every graph except two complete graphs K-3 and K-5 has an OPPDC and they claimed that the minimum degree of the minimal counterexample to this conjecture is at least four. In the proof of their claim, when a graph is smaller than the minimal counterexample, they missed to consider the special cases K-3 and K-5. In this paper, among some other results, we present the complete proof for this fact. Moreover, we prove that the minimal counterexample to this conjecture is 2-connected and 3-edge-connected.

We show that bounded approximate Connes-amenability of dual Banach algebras forces them to be unital. For a separable dual Banach algebra, we prove that bounded approximate Connes-amenability implies sequential approximate Connes-amenability.

ON IDEALS OF IDEALS IN C(X)	BULLETIN OF THE IRANIAN MATHEMATICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						Dense separable; cellularity; sigma-compact; F-space; Goldie dimension	SPACES; RINGS	In this article, we have characterized ideals in C(X) in which every ideal is also an ideal (a z-ideal) of C(X). Motivated by this characterization, we observe that C-infinity(X) is a regular ring if and only if every open locally compact sigma-compact subset of X is finite. Concerning prime ideals, it is shown that the sum of every two prime (semiprime) ideals of each ideal in C(X) is prime (semiprime) if and only if X is an F-space. Concerning maximal ideals of an ideal, we generalize the notion of separability to ideals and we have proved the coincidence of separability of an ideal with dense separability of a subspace of beta X. Finally, we have shown that the Goldie dimension of an ideal I in C(X) coincide with the cellularity of X \ Delta(I).	[Azarpanah, F.; Olfati, A.
