For instance, we prove that every non-locally symmetric and non-conformally flat manifold with parallel Weyl tensor (essentially conformally symmetric manifold) satisfies . Manifolds with parallel Weyl tensor having Ricci tensor of rank two form a subclass of the class of Roter type manifolds.

It is shown that the familiar Lebesgue spaces satisfy a range of these inequalities. Connections are made to basic geometric ideas, such as smoothness, convexity, and Pythagorean-type theorems. The results are applied to the linear prediction of random processes spanning a Banach space. In particular, the weak parallelogram laws furnish coefficient growth estimates, Baxter-type inequalities, and criteria for regularity.

Then, we refine matrix Young-type inequalities for the case of Hilbert-Schmidt norm, which hold under certain assumptions on positive semidefinite matrices appearing therein. Finally, we give the refinement and the reverse of the matrix Holder inequality which holds for every unitarily invariant norm. As applications, we also obtain improvements of some well-known matrix inequalities in a quotient form. Our results are compared with the previously known from the literature.

On the characteristic polynomials of linear functional equations	PERIODICA MATHEMATICA HUNGARICA			English	Article						Linear functional equations; Spectral analysis; Field homomorphisms	NONTRIVIAL SOLUTIONS	The solutions of a linear functional equation are typically generalized polynomials. The existence of their non-trivial monomial terms strongly depends on the algebraic properties of some related families of parameters. In extremal cases (the parameters are algebraic numbers or the parameters form an algebraically independent system) we have elegant methods to decide the existence of non-trivial solutions. In this paper we are going to extend and unify the treatment of the existence problem by introducing the characteristic polynomials of a linear functional equation such that the algebraic properties of the roots allows us to conclude the existence of non-trivial solutions.

All four properties turn out to have a description in terms of commutative squares or pullback diagrams. We then use these categorical descriptions to prove an ordered analogue of the well-known relation TP = AP + CEP, namely that a variety of ordered algebras has the ordered transferability property if and only if it has the ordered amalgamation property and QEP.

The case of inhomogeneous Pell inequalities it is equivalent to finding the integer lattice points in translated copies of a long and narrow tilted hyperbolic region with a quadratic irrational slope. We prove randomness in these natural lattice point counting problems. We have two main results: a central limit theorem (Theorem 2.1) and a law of the iterated logarithm (Theorem 2.2). The classical Circle Problem (counting lattice points in large circles) is a notoriously difficult open problem. What our results show is that the hyperbolic analog of the Circle Problem is solvable with striking precision.

The crossing number of a network(graph) is closely related to the minimum layout area required for the implementation of a VLSI circuit for that network. From this perspective, the analysis of crossing numbers of graphs makes most sense when one focuses on networks(graphs) that have good properties as interconnection networks. In this paper, we study the crossing number of the chordal ring networks for all even n >= 10.

In the special case Gyarmati improved on their estimates for the pseudorandom measures of these sequences. Here we extend Gyarmati's result and sharpen the estimates of Sarkozy and Winterhof for any prime power p(r).

We show, that the well-distribution measures of these sequences are small. Furthermore we also show that the correlation measures of these sequences are small for small correlation orders, but if the order of the correlation is greater than the order of the linear recursion, then the correlation can be large.
