On solvability of the Dirichlet problem with the boundary function in L (2) for a second-order elliptic equation	JOURNAL OF CONTEMPORARY MATHEMATICAL ANALYSIS-ARMENIAN ACADEMY OF SCIENCES			English	Article						Dirichlet problem; elliptic equation		We consider Dirichlet problems in a bounded domain Q aS, R (n) for a general secondorder elliptic equation with the boundary function in L (2). In the author's previous papers necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of an (n - 1)-dimensionally continuous solution were obtained under some natural assumptions on the coefficients of equation. Those assumptions are formulated in terms of an auxiliary operator equation in a special Hilbert space and are difficult to verify. In the present paper we obtain necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of a solution in terms of the original problem for a more narrow class of the right-hand sides. It is shown that if, in addition, the boundary function is assumed to be in the space W (2) (1/2) (a,Q), then the obtained conditions transform into solvability conditions in the space W (2) (1) (Q).

On Finsler Sigma-spaces	JOURNAL OF CONTEMPORARY MATHEMATICAL ANALYSIS-ARMENIAN ACADEMY OF SCIENCES			English	Article						Finsler space; Sigma-space; generalized symmetric space; Berwald space	REGULAR PHI-SPACES	In this paper, we study Finsler Sigma-spaces. We first prove that any Sigma-space is a homogeneous Finsler space. Then we study some geometric properties of Berwald Sigma-spaces and prove that any generalized symmetric Berwald space is a Berwald Sigma-space where Sigma is cyclic. Then we show that if each S (sigma) is parallel with respect to Berwald connection of a Berwald Sigma-space then the space is locally symmetric. Finally we study some existence theorems.

In fact the solution space of the differential equation y' = 0 is infinite dimensional. In this paper, we give sufficient conditions for a function on an open subset of the Levi-Civita field to have zero derivative everywhere and we use the nonconstant zero-derivative functions to obtain non-analytic solutions of systems of linear ordinary differential equations with analytic coefficients. Then we use the results to introduce Bessel-type special functions on the Levi-Civita field and to study some of their properties.	[Meszaros, A.

Second Order Asymptotical Efficiency for a Poisson Process	Journal of Contemporary Mathematical Analysis-Armenian Academy of Sciences			English	Article						Poisson process; second order estimation; asymptotic efficiency		We consider the problem of the non-parametric estimation of the mean function of an inhomogeneous Poisson process when its intensity function is periodic. For integral-type quadratic loss functions there is a classical lower bound for all estimators and the empirical mean function attains that lower bound, thus it is asymptotically efficient. Following the ideas of the work by Golubev and Levit, we compare asymptotically efficient estimators and propose an estimator which is second order asymptotically efficient. Second order efficiency is done over Sobolev ellipsoids, following the ideas of Pinsker.	[Gasparyan, S. B.] Univ Maine, F-72017 Le Mans, France; [Gasparyan, S.

In terms of an entire function, interpolating the coefficients of series, we find the sizes of polyarcs, constituting the regular set.

Asymptotic properties of maximum likelihood estimators for a generalized Pareto-type distribution	JOURNAL OF CONTEMPORARY MATHEMATICAL ANALYSIS-ARMENIAN ACADEMY OF SCIENCES			English	Article						Generalized Pareto-type frequency distribution; maximum likelihood estimator		Astola and Danielian [1], using stochastic birth-death process, have proposed a regular four-parameter discrete probability distribution, called generalized Pareto-type model, which is an appealing distribution for modeling phenomena in Bioinformatics. Farbod and Gasparian [5], fitted this distribution to the two sets of real data, and have derived conditions under which a solution for the system of likelihood equations exists and coincides with the maximum likelihood estimators (MLE) for the model unknown parameters. Also, in [5], an accumulation method for approximate computation of the MLE has been considered with simulation studies. In this paper we show that for sufficiently large sample size the system of likelihood equations has a solution, which according to [5], coincides with the MLE of vector-valued parameter for the underlying model. Besides, we establish asymptotic unbiasedness, weak consistency, asymptotic normality, asymptotic efficiency, and convergence of arbitrary moments of the MLE, by verifying the so-called regularity-conditions.
