In this paper, we obtain lower and upper bounds on the first Zagreb index M-1(G) of G in terms of the number of vertices (n), number of edges (m), maximum vertex degree (Delta), and minimum vertex degree (delta). Using this result, we find lower and upper bounds on M-2(G). Also, we present lower and upper bounds on M-2(G) + M-2((G) over bar) in terms of n, m, Delta, and delta, where G denotes the complement of G. Moreover, we determine the bounds on first Zagreb coindex (M) over bar (1)(G) and second Zagreb coindex (M) over bar (2)(G). Finally, we give a relation between the first Zagreb index and the second Zagreb index of graph G.

Solving sparse non-negative tensor equations: algorithms and applications	FRONTIERS OF MATHEMATICS IN CHINA			English	Article						Nonnegative tensor; multi-dimensional network; information retrieval; community; iterative method; multivariate polynomial equation	DECOMPOSITIONS; UNIQUENESS; SYSTEMS	We study iterative methods for solving a set of sparse non-negative tensor equations (multivariate polynomial systems) arising from data mining applications such as information retrieval by query search and community discovery in multi-dimensional networks. By making use of sparse and non-negative tensor structure, we develop Jacobi and Gauss-Seidel methods for solving tensor equations. The multiplication of tensors with vectors are required at each iteration of these iterative methods, the cost per iteration depends on the number of non-zeros in the sparse tensors. We show linear convergence of the Jacobi and Gauss-Seidel methods under suitable conditions, and therefore, the set of sparse non-negative tensor equations can be solved very efficiently. Experimental results on information retrieval by query search and community discovery in multi-dimensional networks are presented to illustrate the application of tensor equations and the effectiveness of the proposed methods.

First, the 3D parabolic equation is discretized in spatial variables by using spectral collocation method and the discrete scheme is transformed into matrix formulation by tensor product. Second, the classical SFDS is obtained by difference discretization in time-direction. The ensemble of data are comprised with the first few transient solutions of the classical SFDS for the 3D parabolic equation and the POD bases of ensemble of data are generated by using POD technique and SVD. The unknown quantities of the classical SFDS are replaced with the linear combination of POD bases and a reduced-order extrapolation SFDS with lower dimensions and sufficiently high accuracy for the 3D parabolic equation is established. Third, the error estimates between the classical SFDS solutions and the reduced-order extrapolation SFDS solutions and the implementation for solving the reduced-order extrapolation SFDS are provided. Finally, a numerical example shows that the errors of numerical computations are consistent with the theoretical results. Moreover, it is shown that the reduced-order extrapolation SFDS is effective and feasible to find the numerical solutions for the 3D parabolic equation.

A submanifold attaining equality in this inequality pointwise is called a Wintgen ideal submanifold. As conformal invariant objects, Wintgen ideal submanifolds are investigated in this paper using the framework of Mobius geometry. We classify Wintgen ideal submanfiolds of dimension m a (c) 1/2 3 and arbitrary codimension when a canonically defined 2-dimensional distribution is integrable. Such examples come from cones, cylinders, or rotational submanifolds over super-minimal surfaces in spheres, Euclidean spaces, or hyperbolic spaces, respectively. We conjecture that if generates a k-dimensional integrable distribution and k < m, then similar reduction theorem holds true. This generalization when k = 3 has been proved in this paper.

This result can be seen as an extension of Reilly's bound for the first non-zero closed eigenvalue of the Laplace operator.

OD-Characterization of certain four dimensional linear groups with related results concerning degree patterns	FRONTIERS OF MATHEMATICS IN CHINA			English	Article						Prime graph; degree pattern; simple group	FINITE SIMPLE-GROUPS; PRIME GRAPH; RECOGNITION; ORDERS	The prime graph of a finite group G, which is denoted by GK(G), is a simple graph whose vertex set is comprised of the prime divisors of |G| and two distinct prime divisors p and q are joined by an edge if and only if there exists an element of order pq in G. Let p (1) < p (2) < a <- < p (k) be all prime divisors of |G|. Then the degree pattern of G is defined as D(G) = (deg (G) (p (1)), degG(p (2)), a <-, deg (G) (p (k) )), where deg (G) (p) signifies the degree of the vertex p in GK(G). A finite group H is said to be OD-characterizable if G a parts per thousand OE H for every finite group G such that |G| = |H| and D(G) = D(H). The purpose of this article is threefold. First, it finds sharp upper and lower bounds on I(G), the sum of degrees of all vertices in GK(G), for any finite group G (Theorem 2.1). Second, it provides the degree of vertices 2 and the characteristic p of the base field of any finite simple group of Lie type in their prime graphs (Propositions 3.1-3.7). Third, it proves the linear groups L (4)(q), q = 19, 23, 27, 29, 31, 32, and 37, are OD-characterizable (Theorem 4.2).	[Moghaddamfar, A.

Let lambda (1) and lambda (2) be positive real numbers such that lambda (1)/lambda (2) is irrational and algebraic. For any (C, c) well-spaced sequence V and delta > 0, let E(V,X, delta) denote the number of v a V with v a (c) 1/2 X for which the inequality |lambda (1) p (1) + lambda (2) p (2) - v| has no solution in primes p (1), p (2).

In this paper, we give the classification of the relative locations of two bracketed subwords of a bracketed word in an operated semigroup into the separated, nested, and intersecting cases. We achieve this by establishing a correspondence between relative locations of bracketed words and those of words by applying the concept of Motzkin words which are the algebraic forms of Motzkin paths.

We arrive directly at the same estimates by the 'double coordinate' approach and asymptotic behavior of parabolic flows. Although using the techniques appeared in the above paper, we partly simplify the method and argument. This maybe help to provide an easy way for estimating spectral gap. Besides, we also get a new lower bound of spectral gap for a class of Schodinger operator.

We adopt the Grad type moment expansion which was firstly proposed for the Boltzmann equation. A new regularization method for the Grad's moment system was recently proposed to achieve the globally hyperbolicity so that the local well-posedness of the moment system is attained. For the VM equations, the moment expansion of the convection term is exactly the same as that in the Boltzmann equation, thus the new developed regularization applies. The moment expansion of the electromagnetic force term in the VM equations turns out to be a linear source term, which can preserve the conservative properties of the distribution function in the VM equations perfectly.

In this paper, we show that the support of a simple weight module over the Ramond algebra with an infinite-dimensional weight space coincides with the weight lattice and that all intersections of non-trivial weight spaces and odd part or even part of the module are infinite-dimensional. This result together with the one that we have obtained over the Neveu-Schwarz algebra generalizes the result for the Virasoro algebra to the super-Virasoro algebras.

By means of the properties of a so-called occupation measure of a policy, we show that the constrained optimality problem is equivalent to an (infinite-dimensional) linear programming on the set of occupation measures with some constraints, and thus prove the existence of an optimal policy under suitable conditions. Furthermore, using the equivalence between the constrained optimality problem and the linear programming, we obtain an exact form of an optimal policy for the case of finite states and actions. Finally, as an example, a controlled queueing system is given to illustrate our results.

J	Chen, L; Ren, GB; Wang, HY				Chen, Lin; Ren, Guangbin; Wang, Haiyan			Bicomplex Hermitian Clifford analysis	FRONTIERS OF MATHEMATICS IN CHINA			English	Article						Bicomplex numbers; Hermitian Clifford analysis; Witt basis; Cauchy integral formula		Complex Hermitian Clifford analysis emerged recently as a refinement of the theory of several complex variables, while at the same time, the theory of bicomplex numbers motivated by the bicomplex version of quantum mechanics is also under full development. This stimulates us to combine the Hermitian Clifford analysis with the theory of bicomplex number so as to set up the theory of bicomplex Hermitian Clifford analysis. In parallel with the Euclidean Clifford analysis, the bicomplex Hermitian Clifford analysis is centered around the bicomplex Hermitian Dirac operator D : C-infinity(R-4n, W-4n) -> C-infinity(R-4n, W-4n), where W-4n is the tensor product of three algebras, i.e., the hyperbolic quaternion (B) over cap, the bicomplex number B, and the Clifford algebra R-0,R-4n. The operator D is a square root of the Laplacian in R-4n, introduced by the formula D = Sigma(3)(j=0) K-j partial derivative(Zj) with K-j being the basis of (B) over cap, and partial derivative(Zj) denoting the twisted Hermitian Dirac operators in the bicomplex Clifford algebra B circle times R-0,R-4n whose definition involves a delicate construction of the bicomplex Witt basis. The introduction of the operator D can also overturn the prevailing opinion in the Hermitian Clifford analysis in the complex or quaternionic setting that the complex or quaternionic Hermitiean monogenic functions are described by a system of equations instead of by a single equation like classical monogenic functions which are null solutions of Dirac operator. In contrast to the Hermitian Clifford analysis in quaternionic setting, the Poisson brackets of the twisted real Clifford vectors do not vanish in general in the bicomplex setting. For the operator D, we establish the Cauchy integral formula, which generalizes the Martinelli-Bochner formula in the theory of several complex variables.

Although the schemes share some common features with the ones proposed by C. Bender and J. Zhang [Ann. Appl. Probab., 2008, 18: 143-177], less computational work is needed for our method. For both our schemes and the ones proposed by Bender and Zhang, we rigorously obtain first-order error estimates, which improve the half-order error estimates of Bender and Zhang. Moreover, numerical tests are given to demonstrate the first-order accuracy of the schemes.

For any set P of prime ideals of A, we define a new ring Na(A,P): the Nagata ring. This new ring has the particularity that we may transform certain properties relative to P to properties on the whole ring Na(A,P); some of these properties are: ascending chain condition, Krull dimension, Cohen-Macaulay, Gorenstein. Our main aim is to show that most of the above properties relative to a set of prime ideals P (i.e., local properties) determine and are determined by the same properties on the Nagata ring (i.e., global properties). In order to look for new applications, we show that this construction is functorial, and exhibits a functorial embedding from the localized category (A,P)-Mod into the module category Na(A,P)-Mod.

A proper vertex coloring of G is acyclic if there is no bichromatic cycle. It was proved by Alon et al. [Acyclic coloring of graphs.

In this paper, we combine above two colorings and show that if k a parts per thousand yen 5 and G does not contain cycles of length 4, then G admits an acyclic coloring with O(Delta((k-1)/(k-2))) colors such that no path with k vertices is bichromatic.

The classical Schur-Cohn-Fujiwara theorem converts the inertia problem of a polynomial to that of an appropriate Hermitian matrix under the condition that the associated Bezout matrix is nonsingular. To complete it, we discuss an extended version of the Schur-Cohn-Fujiwara theorem to the singular case of that Bezout matrix. Our method is mainly based on a perturbation technique for a Bezout matrix.

All players are assumed to sit around a circle and to interact only with their neighbors. It is known that full-defection is the unique long run equilibrium as the probability of players' experimentation (or mutation) tends to zero in the best response dynamics. Here, it is shown that full-cooperation could emerge in the long run if one also cares for his neighbors in the best-response dynamics.

The main idea is to identify the level of the L,vy excursion as the time and count the number of jumps upcrossing the level. By regarding the size of a jump as the birth site of a particle, we construct a branching particle system in which the particles undergo nonlocal branchings and deterministic spatial motions to the left on the positive half line. A particle is removed from the system as soon as it reaches the origin. Then a measure-valued Borel right Markov process can be defined as the counting measures of the particle system. Its total mass evolves according to a Crump-Mode-Jagers (CMJ) branching process and its support represents the residual life times of those existing particles. A similar result for spectrally negative L,vy process is established by a time reversal approach. Properties of the measure-valued processes can be studied via the excursions for the corresponding L,vy processes.

A polymap is defined as a map with every point in the domain associated with a special set of maps. Polymaps can be represented as small subcategories of Set*, the category of pointed sets. Map composition and the counterpart of relation union for maps are generalized to polymap composition and sum. Algebraic structures and categories of polymaps are investigated. Polymaps present the unique perspective of an algebra that can retain many of its properties when its elements (maps) are augmented with collections of other elements.

We prove that G is a perfect 2-matching covered graph if and only if B(G) is a 1-extendable graph. Furthermore, we prove that B(G) is a minimally 1-extendable graph if and only if G is a minimally perfect 2-matching covered graph and for each e = xy is an element of E(G), there is an independent set S in G such that vertical bar Gamma(G)(S)vertical bar = vertical bar S vertical bar + 1, x is an element of S and vertical bar Gamma(G-xy)(S)vertical bar = vertical bar S vertical bar. Then, we construct a digraph D from B(G) or G and show that D is a strongly connected digraph if and only if G is a perfect 2-matching covered graph. So we design an algorithm in O(root v epsilon) time that determines whether G is a perfect 2-matching covered graph or not.

By computing a maximal torus on each L-n,L-m, we show that L-n,L-m are completable nilpotent Lie superalgebras. We also view L-n,L-m as Lie algebras, prove that L-n,L-m are of maximal rank, and show that L-n,L-m are completable nilpotent Lie algebras. As an application of the results, we show a Heisenberg superalgebra is a completable nilpotent Lie superalgebra.

As a conclusion, it is proved that a graph is a skeleton graph of Stasheff polytope if and only if it is both the tilting graph of a hereditary algebra and also the cluster-tilting graph of another hereditary algebra. At last, when comparing such uniformity, the geometric realizations of simplicial complexes associated with tilting modules and cluster-tilting objects are discussed respectively.

Here, a pair of complementary designs form a design in which all the Hamming distances of any two distinct runs are the same, and the uniformity pattern proposed by H. Qin, Z. Wang, and K. Chatterjee [J. Statist. Plann. Inference, 2012, 142: 1170-1177] comes from discrete discrepancy for q-level designs. Based on relationships of the uniformity pattern between a pair of complementary designs, we propose a minimum projection uniformity rule to assess and compare q-level factorials.

We derive the finite explicit elementary expression for the joint density function of three characteristics: the time of ruin, the surplus immediately before ruin, and the deficit at ruin. By using the explicit joint density function, we give a concise expression for the Gerber-Shiu function with no dividends. Finally, we obtain an integral equation for the Gerber-Shiu function under the barrier dividend strategy. The solution can be expressed as a combination of the Gerber-Shiu function without dividends and the solution of the corresponding homogeneous integral equation. This latter function is given clearly by means of the Gerber-Shiu function without dividends.

A k-cycle packing of K (n) is a triple (X, C, L), where C is a collection of edge disjoint k-cycles of K (n) and L is the collection of edges of K (n) not belonging to any of the k-cycles in C. A k-cycle packing (X, C, L) is called resolvable if C can be partitioned into almost parallel classes. A resolvable maximum k-cycle packing of K (n) , denoted by k-RMCP(n), is a resolvable k-cycle packing of K (n) , (X, C, L), in which the number of almost parallel classes is as large as possible. Let D(n, k) denote the number of almost parallel classes in a k-RMCP(n). D(n, k) for k = 3, 4 has been decided. When n a parts per thousand k (mod 2k) and k a parts per thousand 1 (mod 2) or n a parts per thousand 1 (mod 2k) and k a {6, 8, 10, 14} a(a) {m: 5 a (c) 1/2 m a (c) 1/2 49, m a parts per thousand 1 (mod 2)}, D(n, k) also has been decided with few possible exceptions.

We start from one simplified model of A. Brace, D. Gatarek, and M. Musiela (1997) and find out that the copula function between two LIBOR rates can be expressed as a sum of an infinite series, where the main term is a distribution function with Gaussian copula. Partial differential equation method is used for deriving the copula expansion. Numerical results show that the copula of the LIBOR rates and Gaussian copula are very close in the central region and differ in the tail, and the Gaussian copula approximation to the copula function between the LIBOR rates provides satisfying results in the normal situation.

J	Yang, Y; Liu, YP				Yang, Yan; Liu, Yanpei			Embedding of circulant graphs and generalized Petersen graphs on projective plane	FRONTIERS OF MATHEMATICS IN CHINA			English	Article						Embedding; joint tree; circulant graph; generalized Petersen graph; projective plane	GENUS DISTRIBUTION; DISTRIBUTIONS; FLEXIBILITY; LADDERS	Both the circulant graph and the generalized Petersen graph are important types of graphs in graph theory. In this paper, the structures of embeddings of circulant graph C(2n + 1; {1, n}) on the projective plane are described, the number of embeddings of C(2n + 1; {1, n}) on the projective plane follows, then the number of embeddings of the generalized Petersen graph P(2n + 1, n) on the projective plane is deduced from that of C(2n + 1; {1, n}), because C(2n + 1; {1, n}) is a minor of P(2n + 1, n), their structures of embeddings have relations. In the same way, the number of embeddings of the generalized Petersen graph P(2n, 2) on the projective plane is also obtained.

We also analyse the computational complexity of each algorithm by using combinatorial quantities, such as the Catalan number, the Motzkin number, and the central binomial coefficients. The accuracy and efficiency of our algorithms have been justified by numerical experiments.
