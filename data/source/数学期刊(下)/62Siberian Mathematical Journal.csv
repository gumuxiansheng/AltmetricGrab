P. Pozhidaev proved that each dialgebra may be embedded into a dialgebra with a barunit. As is known, a dialgebra is a vector space with two binary operations satisfying the axioms of a dimonoid. It is natural in this situation to pose the problem about the possibility of adjoining bar-units to dimonoids in a given class and the problem of embedding dimonoids into dimonoids with bar-units. In the present article these problems are solved for some classes of dimonoids. In particular, we show that it is impossible to adjoin a set of bar-units to a free dimonoid. Also, we solve the problem of embedding an arbitrary dimonoid into a dimonoid with bar-units.

Capacity estimates, Liouville's theorem, and singularity removal for mappings with bounded (p, q)-distortion	SIBERIAN MATHEMATICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						mappings with bounded weighted (p, q)-distortion; capacity estimate; Liouville-type theorem; singularity removal	WEIGHTED SOBOLEV SPACES; CARNOT GROUPS; REGULARITY; INVERSE	The mappings with bounded weighted (p, q)-distortion are natural generalizations of the class of mappings with bounded distortion which appears as a doubly indexed scale for p = q = n in the absence of weight functions. In case n - 1 < q a parts per thousand currency sign p = n, the mappings with bounded (p, q)-distortion were studied previously in a series of articles under the additional assumption that the mapping enjoys Luzin's N-property. In this article we present the first facts of the theory of mappings with bounded (p, q)-distortion which are obtained without additional analytical assumptions. The core of the theory consists of the new analytical properties of pushforward functions; in particular, we prove that the gradient of the pushforward function vanishes almost everywhere on the image of the branch set. Some estimates are given on the capacity of the images of condensers under mappings with bounded (p, q)-distortion. We obtain Liouville-type theorems and the singularity removal theorems for the mappings of this class, and we apply these theorems to classifying manifolds.	[Baykin, A. N.; Vodop'yanov, S.

The vertex-face weight of edges in 3-polytopes	SIBERIAN MATHEMATICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						plane maps; plane graph; 3-polytope; structural properties; weight of edge	LIGHT SUBGRAPHS; PLANAR GRAPHS	The weight w(e) of an edge e in a 3-polytope is the maximum degree-sum of the two vertices and two faces incident with e. In 1940, Lebesgue proved that each 3-polytope without the so-called pyramidal edges has an edge e with w(e) a parts per thousand currency sign 21. In 1995, this upper bound was improved to 20 by Avgustinovich and Borodin. Note that each edge of the n-pyramid is pyramidal and has weight n + 9. Recently, we constructed a 3-polytope without pyramidal edges satisfying w(e) a parts per thousand yen 18 for each e. The purpose of this paper is to prove that each 3-polytope without pyramidal edges has an edge e with w(e) a parts per thousand currency sign 18. In other terms, this means that each plane quadrangulation without a face incident with three vertices of degree 3 has a face with the vertex degree-sum at most 18, which is tight.	[Borodin, O.

We study the relationship between generalized reverse derivations and generalized derivations on an ideal in a semiprime ring.

We reveal some properties of groups with submodular Sylow subgroups. A group G is called strongly supersoluble if G is supersoluble and every Sylow subgroup of G is submodular. We show that G is strongly supersoluble if and only if G is metanilpotent and every Sylow subgroup of G is submodular. The following are proved to be equivalent: (1) every Sylow subgroup of a group is submodular; (2) a group is Ore dispersive and its every biprimary subgroup is strongly supersoluble; and (3) every metanilpotent subgroup of a group is supersoluble.

Heights of minor faces in triangle-free 3-polytopes	SIBERIAN MATHEMATICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						plane map; plane graph; 3-polytope; structural properties; height of a face	LIGHT SUBGRAPHS; PLANE; WEIGHT; GRAPHS	The height h(f) of a face f in a 3-polytope is the maximum of the degrees of vertices incident with f. A 4-face is pyramidal if it is incident with at least three 3-vertices. We note that in the (3, 3, 3, n)-Archimedean solid each face f is pyramidal and satisfies h(f) = n. In 1940, Lebesgue proved that every quadrangulated 3-polytope without pyramidal faces has a face f with h(f) a parts per thousand currency sign 11. In 1995, this bound was improved to 10 by Avgustinovich and Borodin. Recently, the authors improved it to 8 and constructed a quadrangulated 3-polytope without pyramidal faces satisfying h(f) a parts per thousand yen 8 for each f. The purpose of this paper is to prove that each 3-polytope without triangles and pyramidal 4-faces has either a 4-face with h(f) a parts per thousand currency sign 10 or a 5-face with h(f) a parts per thousand currency sign 5, where the bounds 10 and 5 are sharp.

A new characterization of some finite simple groups	SIBERIAN MATHEMATICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						finite simple groups; zeros of characters	VANISHING PRIME GRAPH; IRREDUCIBLE CHARACTERS	Let G be a finite group. A vanishing element of G is g a G such that chi(g) = 0 for some chi a Irr(G) of the set of irreducible complex characters of G. Denote by Vo(G) the set of the orders of vanishing elements of G. A finite group G is called a VCP-group if every element in Vo(G) is of prime power order. The main purpose of this paper is to investigate a new characterization related to Vo(G) for all finite nonabelian simple VCP-groups. We prove that if G is a finite group and M is a finite nonabelian simple VCP-group such that Vo(G) = Vo(M) and |G| = |M|, then G a parts per thousand... M.	[Ghasemabadi, M.

On characterization by order and prime graph for alternating groups	SIBERIAN MATHEMATICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						alternating group; symmetric group; solvable graph; prime graph; degree pattern; Goldbach's conjecture	DEGREE PATTERN; FINITE-GROUPS	There are some graphs related to the structure of a finite group, e.g. the prime graph, the solvable graph, and the noncommuting graph of a finite group. In this paper, we consider characterization by order and prime graph for alternating groups. In particular, we show that there exists a closed relation between characterization by order and prime graph of some of the alternating groups and Goldbach's conjecture. Also by using the main results, we answer some conjectures and a problem about characterization by order and degree pattern for alternating and symmetric groups that are stated in [R.

We introduce 2k-forms Z (k) (a) (k = 1, 2,... ) of the Fourier coefficients of a, called the zeta-invariants. These invariants are determined by the eigenvalues of aI > (e) . We study some properties of the forms Z (k) (a); in particular, their invariance under the conformal group. A few open questions about zeta-invariants is posed at the end of the article.

A Fitting class F not equal (1) is called normal in the class S pi of all finite soluble pi-groups or pi-normal, whenever F aS dagger S pi and for every G a S pi its F-injectors constitute a normal subgroup of G. We study the properties of pi-normal Fitting classes. Using Lockett operators, we prove a criterion for the pi-normality of products of Fitting classes. A pi-normal Fitting class is normal in the case pi = P. The lattice of all solvable normal Fitting classes is a sublattice of the lattice of all solvable Fitting classes; but the question of modularity of the lattice of all solvable Fitting classes is open (see Question 14.47 in [1]). We obtain a positive answer to a similar question in the case of pi-normal Fitting classes.	[Vorob'ev, N. T.; Martsinkevich, A.

The Boolean transfer principle for injective Banach lattices	SIBERIAN MATHEMATICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						injective Banach lattice; AL-space; splitting property; M-projection; Maharam operator; Boolean-valued representation; descent; ascent	VALUED MODELS; SPACES	The aim of this paper is to apply the approach of Boolean-valued analysis to the theory of injective Banach lattices and to establish the Boolean-valued transfer principle from AL-spaces to injective Banach lattices. We prove that each injective Banach lattice embeds into an appropriate Boolean-valued model, becoming an AL-space. Hence, each theorem about an AL-space within Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory has an analog in the original injective Banach lattice interpreted as a Boolean-valued AL-space. Translation of theorems from AL-spaces to injective Banach lattices is carried out by the appropriate general operations of Boolean-valued analysis.

An integral geometry underdetermined problem for a family of curves	SIBERIAN MATHEMATICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						singular integral; integral geometry; boundary determination problem; tomography; transport equation		In a general integral geometry problem, there are given the integrals of an unknown function over certain manifolds. The traditional statement of the problem consists in determining the integrand. We consider the case of an underdetermined problem when the unknown functions depend on a greater number of variables than the given integrals. These situations appear in a few applied problems when a rather complicated mathematical model is used and no a priori information is available. For overcoming the lack of appropriate data, we pose the problem of finding part of the information unknown; namely, we search only for the discontinuity surfaces of the integrand. The corresponding uniqueness theorem is proved. The present paper finalizes our studies into the case of integration over one-dimensional manifolds. In the previous articles we considered similar problems in the case of integration over straight lines. In this paper the same result is proved for the integration of unknown functions over unknown curves.	[Anikonov, D.

The solution to this equation, a multifunction, is called a general algebraic function. In the coefficient space we consider the discriminant set a double dagger of the equation and choose in its complement the maximal polydisk domain D containing the origin. We describe the monodromy of the general algebraic function in a neighborhood of D. In particular, we prove that a double dagger intersects the boundary a,D along n real algebraic surfaces of dimension n - 2. Furthermore, every branch y (j) (x) of the general algebraic function ramifies in D only along the pair of surfaces and u((j)) and y((i-1)).

Propermutable characterizations of finite soluble PST-Groups and PT-groups	SIBERIAN MATHEMATICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						finite group; X-propermutable subgroup; PST-group; PT-group; Hall subgroup; supersoluble group	SUBNORMAL SUBGROUPS PERMUTE; TRANSITIVE RELATION; SYLOW SUBGROUPS; QUASINORMALITY	Let H and X be subgroups of a group G. We say that a subgroup H is X-propermutable in G provided that there is a subgroup B of G such that G = N (G) (H)B and H X-permutes (in the sense of [1]) with all subgroups of B. In this paper we analyze the influence of X-propermutable subgroups on the structure of a finite group G. In particular, it is proved that G is a soluble PST-group if and only if all Hall subgroups and all maximal subgroups of every Hall subgroup of G are X-propermutable in G, where X = Z(infinity)(G).

Some correspondence is obtained between the Fourier series for the boundary values of the Schwarz problem and the Laurent series for a regular function f(z) that is the solution of the Schwarz problem. We study in detail the case of a linear-fractional function as a solution to the Schwarz problem in a disk, an annulus, and an arbitrary multiply-connected domain with an application to inverse boundary value problems.
