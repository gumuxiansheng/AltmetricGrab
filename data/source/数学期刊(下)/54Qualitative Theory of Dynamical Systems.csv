We denote by Z(+) the set of all nonnegative integers. Let P-q (Z(+), X) is the set of all X-valued, q-periodic sequences. Then P-1(Z(+), X) is the set of all X-valued constant sequences. When q >= 2, we denote by P-q(0) (Z(+), X), the subspace of P-q (Z(+), X) consisting of all sequences z(.) with z(0) = 0. Let T be a bounded linear operator acting on X. It is known, that the discrete semigroup generated (from the algebraic point of view) of T, i.e. the operator valued sequence T = (T-n), is uniformly exponentially stable (i.e. limn(n ->infinity) ln parallel to T-n parallel to/n < 0), if and only if for each real number mu and each sequences z(.) in P-1(Z(+), X) the sequences (y(n)) given by {y(n+1) = T(1)y(n) + e(i mu(n+1))z(n +1), y(0) = 0 is bounded. In this paper we prove a complementary result taking P-q(0) (Z(+), X) with some integer q >= 2 instead of P-1(Z(+), X).

This classification, which is taken modulo the action of the group of real affine transformations and time rescaling, is given in terms of affine invariant polynomials. The invariant polynomials allow one to verify for any given real cubic system whether or not it has invariant straight lines of total multiplicity eight, and to specify its configuration of straight lines endowed with their corresponding real singularities of this system. The calculations can be implemented on computer and the results can therefore be applied for any family of cubic systems in this class, given in any normal form.

Different forms of such maps close to splitted separatrices (separatrix maps) are introduced, taking into account the size and shape of the splitting function and also the return time to the domains of interest. Then it is shown how to derive approximations by suitable standard-like maps. Dynamical consequences concerning the existence of invariant rotational curves (IRC) are derived. An application is made to theoretically estimate the location of the outermost IRC in the Sitnikov problem, which is in good agreement with numerical data. To compare with the cases which are approximated by the classical standard map, some details on the properties of the standard-like map with two harmonic terms are included. Finally a method to estimate the amount of chaos depending on the form of the separatrix map is introduced. Except otherwise stated all the systems we consider are assumed to be analytic, despite several of the properties we study are no longer analytic.

Self-Consistent Chaotic Transport in a High-Dimensional Mean-Field Hamiltonian Map Model	QUALITATIVE THEORY OF DYNAMICAL SYSTEMS			English	Article						Self-consistent transport; Normal forms; Sequential periodic orbits; Single-wave model	PLASMAS	Self-consistent chaotic transport is studied in a Hamiltonian mean-field model. The model provides a simplified description of transport in marginally stable systems including vorticity mixing in strong shear flows and electron dynamics in plasmas. Self-consistency is incorporated through a mean-field that couples all the degrees-of-freedom. The model is formulated as a large set of N coupled standard-like area-preserving twist maps in which the amplitude and phase of the perturbation, rather than being constant like in the standard map, are dynamical variables. Of particular interest is the study of the impact of periodic orbits on the chaotic transport and coherent structures. Numerical simulations show that self-consistency leads to the formation of a coherent macro-particle trapped around the elliptic fixed point of the system that appears together with an asymptotic periodic behavior of the mean field. To model this asymptotic state, we introduced a non-autonomous map that allows a detailed study of the onset of global transport. A turnstile-type transport mechanism that allows transport across instantaneous KAM invariant circles in non-autonomous systems is discussed. As a first step to understand transport, we study a special type of orbits referred to as sequential periodic orbits. Using symmetry properties we show that, through replication, high-dimensional sequential periodic orbits can be generated starting from low-dimensional periodic orbits. We show that sequential periodic orbits in the self-consistent map can be continued from trivial (uncoupled) periodic orbits of standard-like maps using numerical and asymptotic methods. Normal forms are used to describe these orbits and to find the values of the map parameters that guarantee their existence. Numerical simulations are used to verify the prediction from the asymptotic methods.

It is not hard to classify which Mobius transformations are elliptic in terms of the parameters. The set of parameters can be identified with the solid torus S-1 x D, and the set of elliptic parameters is called the domain of ellipticity. In this paper, we study the domain of ellipticity for non-trivial unicritical Blaschke products. We will also study the set corresponding to the Mandelbrot set for this family, and show how it can be obtained from the domain of ellipticity by adding one point.

It is well known that for an interval map f, the following statements hold: (1) omega(f) = boolean AND(+infinity)(n=1) f(n)(Omega(f)). (2) Any isolated point of P(f) is also an isolated point of Omega (f). (3) x is an element of Omega (f) if and only if there exist points x(k) -> x and positive integers n(k) -> infinity such that f(nk) (x(k)) = x. In [Mai and Sun (Topol Appl, 154, 2306-2311, 2007); Mai et al. (J Math Anal Appl, 383, 553-559, 2011)], we generalized those results to graph maps. It is natural to ask whether those results can be generalized to dendrite maps. The aim of this paper is to show that the answer is negative.

J	Robinson, C				Robinson, Clark			Topological Decoupling Near Planar Parabolic Orbits	QUALITATIVE THEORY OF DYNAMICAL SYSTEMS			English	Article						Celestial mechanics; Parabolic orbits; Three-body problem	3-BODY PROBLEM	In two different three body problems, oscillatory orbits have been shown to exist for the three-body problem in Celestial Mechanics: Sitnikov, Alekseev, Moser, and McGehee considered a spatial problem which had one degree of freedom; Easton, McGehee, and Xia considered a planar problem which had at least three degrees of freedom. Both situations involve analyzing the motion as one particle with mass goes to infinity while the other two masses stay bounded in elliptic motion. Motion with at infinity corresponds to a periodic orbit in the first problem and the Hopf flow on in the second problem, both of which are normally degenerately hyperbolic. The proof of the existence of oscillatory orbits uses stable and unstable manifolds for these degenerate cases. In order to get the symbolic dynamics which shows the existence of oscillation, the orbits which go near infinity need to be controlled for an unbounded length of time. In this paper, we prove that the flow near infinity for the Easton-McGehee example with three degrees of freedom is topologically equivalent to a product flow, i.e., a Grobman-Hartman type theorem in the degenerate situation.

We verify the existence of a unique vector field H on T such that its composition with the Gauss-Manin connection satisfies certain properties. The ordinary differential equation given by H is a generalization of differential equations introduced by Darboux, Halphen and Ramanujan.

J	Gidea, M				Gidea, Marian			Global Diffusion on a Tight Three-Sphere	QUALITATIVE THEORY OF DYNAMICAL SYSTEMS			English	Article						Hamiltonian dynamics; Arnold diffusion; Aubry-Mather sets; Contact geometry	ARNOLD DIFFUSION; POLYNOMIAL ENTROPIES; REEB FLOWS; EXISTENCE; DYNAMICS; SPACE	We consider an integrable Hamiltonian system weakly coupled with a pendulum-type system. For each energy level within some range, the uncoupled system is assumed to possess a normally hyperbolic invariant manifold diffeomorphic to a three-sphere, which bounds a strictly convex domain, and whose stable and unstable invariant manifolds coincide. The Hamiltonian flow on the three-sphere is equivalent to the Reeb flow for the induced contact form. The strict convexity condition implies that the contact structure on the three-sphere is tight. When a small, generic coupling is added to the system, the normally hyperbolic invariant manifold is preserved as a three-sphere, and the stable and unstable manifolds split, yielding transverse intersections. We show that there exist trajectories that follow any prescribed collection of invariant tori and Aubry-Mather sets within some global section of the flow restricted to the three-sphere. In this sense, we say that the perturbed system exhibits global diffusion on the tight three-sphere.
