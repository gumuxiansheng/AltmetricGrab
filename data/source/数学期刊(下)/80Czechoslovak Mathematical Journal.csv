We deal with bounded and certain unbounded open sets Omega aS dagger a"e (n) and do not require any boundary regularity.

A module M is called a generalized CS-module (or briefly, GCS-module) if any S-closed submodule N of M is a direct summand of M. Any homomorphic image of a GCS-module is also a GCS-module. Any direct sum of a singular (uniform) module and a semi-simple module is a GCS-module. All nonsingular right R-modules are projective if and only if all right R-modules are GCS-modules.

Order complex of ideals in a commutative ring with identity	CZECHOSLOVAK MATHEMATICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						ideal; commutative ring; order complex; homotopy type	DIMENSION	Order complex is an important object associated to a partially ordered set. Following a suggestion from V. A. Vassiliev (1994), we investigate an order complex associated to the partially ordered set of nontrivial ideals in a commutative ring with identity. We determine the homotopy type of the geometric realization for the order complex associated to a general commutative ring with identity. We show that this complex is contractible except for semilocal rings with trivial Jacobson radical when it is homotopy equivalent to a sphere.

We define mutation pairs in n-angulated categories and prove that given such a mutation pair, the corresponding quotient category carries a natural n-angulated structure.

Many related concepts arise: Euler's totient function and Carmichael's lambda function, Fermat pseudoprimes, Carmichael and cyclic numbers, Lehmer's totient problem, Giuga's conjecture, etc. In this paper, we present and study analogues to some of the previous concepts arising when we consider the underlying group G (n) := {a + bi a a"currency sign[i]/na"currency sign[i]: a (2) + b (2) a parts per thousand 1 (mod n)}. In particular, we characterize Gaussian Carmichael numbers via a Korselt's criterion and present their relation with Gaussian cyclic numbers. Finally, we present the relation between Gaussian Carmichael number and 1-Williams numbers for numbers n a parts per thousand 3 (mod 4).

We prove that if G is an aS-group which satisfies the descending chain condition on subgroups, then G is finite. Among other results, we characterize all abelian groups for which every nontrivial quotient group is an aS-group.

Namely, a covariant functor from the category of mapping tori to a category of AF-algebras is constructed; the functor takes continuous maps between such manifolds to stable homomorphisms between the corresponding AF-algebras. We use this functor to develop an obstruction theory for the torus bundles of dimension 2, 3 and 4. In conclusion, we consider two numerical examples illustrating our main results.

At each point p of M, the tangent space admits a so-called Singer-Thorpe basis (ST basis) with respect to the curvature tensor R at p. In this basis, up to standard symmetries and antisymmetries, just 5 components of the curvature tensor R are nonzero. For the space of constant curvature, the group O(4) acts as a transformation group between ST bases at T (p) M and for the so-called 2-stein curvature tensors, the group Sp(1) aS, SO(4) acts as a transformation group between ST bases. In the present work, the complete list of Lie subgroups of SO(4) which act as transformation groups between ST bases for certain classes of Einstein curvature tensors is presented. Special representations of groups SO(2), T (2), Sp(1) or U(2) are obtained and the classes of curvature tensors whose transformation group into new ST bases is one of the mentioned groups are determined.

Differential spaces are one of possible generalizations of the concept of an infinitely differentiable manifold. It is known that in many (very important) mathematical models, the manifold structure breaks down. Therefore it is important to introduce a more general concept. In this paper, in particular, the behaviour of k (th) order tangent spaces, their dimensions, and other geometric properties, are described in the context of the process of gluing differential spaces. At the end some examples are given. The paper is self-consistent, i.e., a short review of the differential spaces theory is presented at the beginning.

Results we obtained are of the form: the exponential stability of ordinary differential equation implies the exponential stability of the corresponding delay differential equation if the delays are small enough. We estimate this smallness through the coefficients of this delay equation. Examples demonstrate that our tests of the exponential stability are essentially better than the known ones. This method works not only for autonomous equations but also for equations with variable coefficients and delays.

In this paper, let G be a finite group and p the smallest prime divisor of |G|, the order of G. Let P a Syl (p) (G). As a generalization of Burnside's theorem, it is shown that if every non-cyclic p-subgroup of G is self-normalizing or normal in G then G is solvable. In particular, if , where n a (c) 3/4 3 for p > 2 and n a (c) 3/4 4 for p = 2, then G is p-nilpotent or p-closed.

Earlier, completely strongly porous sets and some of their properties were studied in the paper V.Bilet, O.Dovgoshey (2013/2014).

This dual relation allows to understand several constructions coming from different fields of functional analysis that can be seen as instances of the abstract one when a particular product is considered. Some relevant examples and applications are shown, regarding pointwise products of Banach function spaces, spaces of integrable functions with respect to vector measures, spaces of operators, multipliers on Banach spaces of analytic functions and spaces of Lipschitz functions.

We present values and bounds for g(n, l), the biggest number k guaranteeing that there exist l graphs on n vertices, each two having edit distance at least k. By edit distance of two graphs G, F we mean the number of edges needed to be added to or deleted from graph G to obtain graph F. This new extremal number g(n, l) is closely linked to the edit distance of graphs. Using probabilistic methods we show that g(n, l) is close to 1/2 (n/2)for small values of l > 2. We also present some exact values for small n and lower bounds for very large l close to the number of non-isomorphic graphs of n vertices.

Our focus is on homological properties of contracting endomorphisms of R, e.g., the Frobenius endomorphism when R contains a field of positive characteristic. For instance, in this case, when R is F-finite and C is a semidualizing R-complex, we prove that the following conditions are equivalent: (i) C is a dualizing R-complex; (ii) C similar to RHom(R) ( R-n,C) for some n > 0; (iii) G(C) -dim(n) R < infinity and C is derived RHom(R) ( R-n,C)-reflexive for some n > 0; and (iv) G(C)-dim(n)R < infinity for infinitely many n > 0.

First families of semigroup free lambda's were described by J. L. Brenner, A. Charnow (1978). In this paper we enlarge the set of known semigroup free lambda's. To do it, we use a new version of "Ping-Pong Lemma" for semigroups embeddable in groups.

A vertex u of a graph G is called locally connected if the induced subgraph G[N(u)] by its neighborhood is connected; otherwise, it is called locally disconnected. In this paper, we prove that if a connected claw-free graph G of order at least three satisfies the following two conditions: (i) for each locally disconnected vertex v of degree at least 3 in G, there is a nonnegative integer s such that v lies on an induced cycle of length at least 4 with at most s non-singular edges and with at least s-5 locally connected vertices; (ii) for each locally disconnected vertex v of degree 2 in G, there is a nonnegative integer s such that v lies on an induced cycle C with at most s non-singular edges and with at least s-3 locally connected vertices and such that G[V (C)a (c) V (2)(G)] is a path or a cycle, then G has a 2-factor, and it is the best possible in some sense.

Clearly, a k-tree has at least k + 1 vertices, and G is a 1-tree (usual tree) if and only if it is a 1-connected graph and has no K (3)-minor. In this paper, motivated by some properties of 2-trees, we obtain a characterization of k-trees as follows: if G is a graph with at least k + 1 vertices, then G is a k-tree if and only if G has no K (k+2)-minor, G does not contain any chordless cycle of length at least 4 and G is k-connected.

J	Goldberg, F				Goldberg, Felix			A spectral bound for graph irregularity	CZECHOSLOVAK MATHEMATICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						irregularity; Laplacian matrix; degree; Laplacian index	EIGENVALUES	The imbalance of an edge e = {u, v} in a graph is defined as i(e) = |d(u)-d(v)|, where d(center dot) is the vertex degree. The irregularity I(G) of G is then defined as the sum of imbalances over all edges of G. This concept was introduced by Albertson who proved that I(G) a (c) 1/2 4n (3)/27 (where n = |V(G)|) and obtained stronger bounds for bipartite and triangle-free graphs. Since then a number of additional bounds were given by various authors. In this paper we prove a new upper bound, which improves a bound found by Zhou and Luo in 2008. Our bound involves the Laplacian spectral radius lambda.

We study the relationship between these spaces, and discuss the Lebesgue point theorem in these spaces. We also deal with the boundedness of the Hardy-Littlewood maximal operator on Musielak-Orlicz spaces.

We also give the result for the embedding into multiple exponential spaces. Our main result is Theorem 1.6 where we show that if one passes to unbounded domains, then, after the usual modification of the integrand in the Moser functional, the statement of the Concentration-Compactnes Principle is very similar to the statement in the case of a bounded domain. In particular, in the case of a nontrivial weak limit the borderline exponent is still given by the formula P:= (1 - parallel to Phi(vertical bar del u vertical bar)parallel to(L1(Rn)))(-1/(n-1)).

The matching number of a graph G, denoted by alpha'(G), is the number of edges in a maximum matching of G. In 1966, Gallai conjectured that all the longest paths of a connected graph have a common vertex. Although this conjecture has been disproved, finding some nice classes of graphs that support this conjecture is still very meaningful and interesting. In this short note, we prove that Gallai's conjecture is true for every connected graph G with alpha'(G) a (c) 1/2 3.

J	Liu, HN; Dong, H				Liu, Huaning; Dong, Hui			On the distribution of consecutive square-free primitive roots modulo p	CZECHOSLOVAK MATHEMATICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						square-free; primitive root; square sieve; character sum	NUMBERS	A positive integer n is called a square-free number if it is not divisible by a perfect square except 1. Let p be an odd prime. For n with (n, p) = 1, the smallest positive integer f such that n (f) a parts per thousand 1 (mod p) is called the exponent of n modulo p. If the exponent of n modulo p is p - 1, then n is called a primitive root mod p. Let A(n) be the characteristic function of the square-free primitive roots modulo p. In this paper we study the distribution Sigma(n <= x) A(n)A(n+1), and give an asymptotic formula by using properties of character sums.

J	Gelbukh, I				Gelbukh, Irina			Co-rank and Betti number of a group	CZECHOSLOVAK MATHEMATICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						co-rank; inner rank; fundamental group	MORSE FORM FOLIATION; COMPACT LEAVES	For a finitely generated group, we study the relations between its rank, the maximal rank of its free quotient, called co-rank (inner rank, cut number), and the maximal rank of its free abelian quotient, called the Betti number. We show that any combination of the group's rank, co-rank, and Betti number within obvious constraints is realized for some finitely presented group (for Betti number equal to rank, the group can be chosen torsion-free). In addition, we show that the Betti number is additive with respect to the free product and the direct product of groups. Our results are important for the theory of foliations and for manifold topology, where the corresponding notions are related with the cut-number (or genus) and the isotropy index of the manifold, as well as with the operations of connected sum and direct product of manifolds.

J	Arias-Marco, T; Kowalski, O				Arias-Marco, Teresa; Kowalski, Oldrich			Classification of 4-dimensional homogeneous weakly einstein manifolds	CZECHOSLOVAK MATHEMATICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						Riemannian homogeneous manifold; Einstein manifold; weakly Einstein manifold	CURVATURE; METRICS	Y.Euh, J. Park and K. Sekigawa were the first authors who defined the concept of a weakly Einstein Riemannian manifold as a modification of that of an Einstein Riemannian manifold. The defining formula is expressed in terms of the Riemannian scalar invariants of degree two. This concept was inspired by that of a super-Einstein manifold introduced earlier by A.Gray and T. J.Willmore in the context of mean-value theorems in Riemannian geometry. The dimension 4 is the most interesting case, where each Einstein space is weakly Einstein. The original authors gave two examples of homogeneous weakly Einstein manifolds (depending on one, or two parameters, respectively) which are not Einstein. The goal of this paper is to prove that these examples are the only existing examples. We use, for this purpose, the classification of 4-dimensional homogeneous Riemannian manifolds given by L.B,rard Bergery and, also, the basic method and many explicit formulas from our previous article with different topic published in Czechoslovak Math. J. in 2008. We also use Mathematica 7.0 to organize better the tedious routine calculations. The problem of existence of non-homogeneous weakly Einstein spaces in dimension 4 which are not Einstein remains still unsolved.

As a natural counterpart of this concept, Li et al. in 2011 introduced the concept of generalized k-edge-connectivity which is defined as lambda (k) (G) = min{lambda(S): S aS dagger V (G) and |S| = k}, where lambda(S) denotes the maximum number l of pairwise edge-disjoint trees T (1), T (2), aEuro broken vertical bar, T (l) in G such that S aS dagger V (T (i) ) for 1 a (c) 1/2 i a (c) 1/2 l. In this paper we prove that for any two connected graphs G and H we have lambda (3)(G a- H) a (c) 3/4 lambda (3)(G) + lambda (3)(H), where G a- H is the Cartesian product of G and H. Moreover, the bound is sharp. We also obtain the precise values for the generalized 3-edge-connectivity of the Cartesian product of some special graph classes.

The conjecture of Havel (1984) claims that the cubical dimension of every balanced binary tree with 2 (n) vertices, n a (c) 3/4 1, is n. The 2-rooted complete binary tree of depth n is obtained from two copies of the complete binary tree of depth n by adding an edge linking their respective roots. In this paper, we determine the cubical dimension of trees obtained by subdividing twice a 2-rooted complete binary tree and prove that every such balanced tree satisfies the conjecture of Havel.

The well known results of Mosco show that typically the limit fractal equipped with the invariant measure is a (normal) space of homogeneous type. But the doubling property along this iteration is generally not preserved even when the starting point, and of course the limit point, both have the doubling property. We prove that the elements of Hutchinson orbits possess the doubling property except perhaps for radii which decrease to zero as the step of the iteration grows, and in this sense, we say that the doubling property of the limit is achieved gradually. We use this result to prove the uniform upper doubling property of the orbits.

Typically in this paper, we deal with real hypersurfaces in a complex two-plane Grassmannian G (2)(a", (m+2)) which has a remarkable geometric structure as a Hermitian symmetric space of rank 2. In relation to the generalized Tanaka-Webster connection, we consider a new concept of the parallel normal Jacobi operator for real hypersurfaces in G (2)(a", (m+2)) and prove non-existence of real hypersurfaces in G (2)(a", (m+2)) with generalized Tanaka-Webster parallel normal Jacobi operator.

A hinge is a subset of k vertices whose deletion from G yields a disconnected graph. We consider the algebraic connectivity and Fiedler vectors of such graphs, paying special attention to the signs of the entries in Fielder vectors corresponding to vertices in a hinge, and to vertices in the connected components at a hinge. The results extend those in Fiedler's papers Algebraic connectivity of graphs (1973), A property of eigenvectors of nonnegative symmetric matrices and its application to graph theory (1975), and Kirkland and Fallat's paper Perron Components and Algebraic Connectivity for Weighted Graphs (1998).

For such a prime p, we establish an expression for (mod p (8)) given in terms of the sums (i = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6). Further, the expression in this congruence is reduced in terms of the sums R (i) (i = 1, 3, 4, 5). Using this congruence, we prove that for any Wolstenholme prime p we have . Moreover, using a recent result of the author, we prove that a prime p satisfying the above congruence must necessarily be a Wolstenholme prime. Furthermore, applying a technique of Helou and Terjanian, the above congruence is given as an expression involving the Bernoulli numbers.

The first of these results is a new version of Heisenberg's uncertainty inequality which states that the Dunkl-Gabor transform of a nonzero function with respect to a nonzero radial window function cannot be time and frequency concentrated around zero. The second result is an analogue of Benedicks' uncertainty principle which states that the Dunkl-Gabor transform of a nonzero function with respect to a particular window function cannot be time-frequency concentrated in a subset of the form S x B(0, b) in the time-frequency plane a"e (d) x a"eI, (d) . As a side result we generalize a related result of Donoho and Stark on stable recovery of a signal which has been truncated and corrupted by noise.

A translation of module-theoretical concept of ojectivity (i.e. generalized relative injectivity) in the context of the lattice of ideals of a modular lattice is introduced. In a modular lattice satisfying a certain condition, a characterization is given for direct summands of an extending ideal to be mutually ojective. We define exchangeable decomposition and internal exchange property of an ideal in a modular lattice. It is shown that a finite decomposition of an extending ideal is exchangeable if and only if its summands are mutually ojective.
