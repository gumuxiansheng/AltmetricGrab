J	Belohlavek, R; Vychodil, V				Belohlavek, Radim; Vychodil, Vilem			A logic of graded attributes	ARCHIVE FOR MATHEMATICAL LOGIC			English	Article						Attribute implication; Fuzzy logic; Graded-style completeness; Pavelka-style logic	FUZZY FUNCTIONAL-DEPENDENCIES; PROPOSITIONAL CALCULI; DATABASE	We present a logic for reasoning about attribute dependencies in data involving degrees such as a degree to which an object is red or a degree to which two objects are similar. The dependencies are of the form A a double dagger' B and can be interpreted in two ways: first, in data tables with entries representing degrees to which objects (rows) have attributes (columns); second, in database tables where each domain is equipped with a similarity relation. We assume that the degrees form a scale equipped with operations representing many-valued logical connectives. If 0 and 1 are the only degrees, the algebra of degrees becomes the two-element Boolean algebra and the two interpretations become well-known dependencies in Boolean data and functional dependencies of relational databases. In a setting with general scales, we obtain a new kind of dependencies with naturally arising degrees of validity, degrees of entailment, and related logical concepts. The deduction rules of the proposed logic are inspired by Armstrong rules and make it possible to infer dependencies to degrees-the degrees of provability. We provide a soundness and completeness theorem for such a setting asserting that degrees of entailment coincide with degrees of provability, prove the independence of deduction rules, and present further observations.

D.n.c. functions play a central role in algorithmic randomness and reverse mathematics. Flood and Towsner asked for which functions h, the principle stating the existence of an h-bounded d.n.c. function (h-DNR) implies Ramsey-type weak Konig's lemma (RWKL). In this paper, we prove that for every computable order h, there exists an -model of h-DNR which is not a not model of the Ramsey-type graph coloring principle for two colors (RCOLOR (2)) and therefore not a model of RWKL. The proof combines bushy tree forcing and a technique introduced by Lerman, Solomon and Towsner to transform a computable non-reducibility into a separation over -models.

J	Medini, A; Zdomskyy, L				Medini, Andrea; Zdomskyy, Lyubomyr			Between Polish and completely Baire	ARCHIVE FOR MATHEMATICAL LOGIC			English	Article						Polish; Miller property; Cantor-Bendixson property; Completely Baire; Hereditarily Baire; Miller-measurable	SPACES; HEREDITARY	All spaces are assumed to be separable and metrizable. Consider the following properties of a space X. (1) X is Polish. (2) For every countable crowded Q subset of X there exists a crowded Q' subset of Q with compact closure. (3) Every closed subspace of X is either scattered or it contains a homeomorphic copy of 2(omega). (4) Every closed subspace of X is a Baire space. While (4) is the well-known property of being completely Baire, properties (2) and (3) have been recently introduced by Kunen, Medini and Zdomskyy, who named them the Miller property and the Cantor-Bendixson property respectively. It turns out that the implications (1) --> (2) --> (3) --> (4) hold for every space X. Furthermore, it follows from a classical result of Hurewicz that all these implications are equivalences if X is coanalytic. Under the axiom of Projective Determinacy, this equivalence result extends to all projective spaces. We will complete the picture by giving a ZFC counterexample and a consistent definable counterexample of lowest possible complexity to the implication (i) <-- (i + 1) for i = 1, 2, 3. For one of these counterexamples we will need a classical theorem of Martin and Solovay, of which we give a new proof, based on a result of Baldwin and Beaudoin. Finally, using a method of Fischer and Friedman, we will investigate how changing the value of the continuum affects the definability of these counterexamples. Along the way, we will show that every uncountable completely Baire space has size continuum.

J	Pequignot, Y				Pequignot, Yann			A Wadge hierarchy for second countable spaces	ARCHIVE FOR MATHEMATICAL LOGIC			English	Article						Wadge reducibility; Wadge hierarchy; Relatively continuous relation; Admissible representation		We define a notion of reducibility for subsets of a second countable T (0) topological space based on relatively continuous relations and admissible representations. This notion of reducibility induces a hierarchy that refines the Baire classes and the Hausdorff-Kuratowski classes of differences. It coincides with Wadge reducibility on zero dimensional spaces. However in virtually every second countable T (0) space, it yields a hierarchy on Borel sets, namely it is well founded and antichains are of length at most 2. It thus differs from the Wadge reducibility in many important cases, for example on the real line or the Scott Domain .

Different similarities	ARCHIVE FOR MATHEMATICAL LOGIC			English	Article						Relational structure; Isomorphic substructure; Partial order; Self-embedding monoid; Isomorphism; Equimorphism; Forcing-equivalence	COMPONENTS; COPIES; SETS	We establish the hierarchy among twelve equivalence relations (similarities) on the class of relational structures: the equality, the isomorphism, the equimorphism, the full relation, four similarities of structures induced by similarities of their self-embedding monoids and intersections of these equivalence relations. In particular, fixing a language L and a cardinal kappa, we consider the interplay between the restrictions of these similarities to the class Mod (L) (kappa) of all L-structures of size kappa. It turns out that, concerning the number of different similarities and the shape of the corresponding Hasse diagram, the class of all structures naturally splits into three parts: finite structures, infinite structures of unary languages, and infinite structures of non-unary languages (where all these similarities are different).

J	Van der Meeren, J; Rathjen, M; Weiermann, A				Van der Meeren, Jeroen; Rathjen, Michael; Weiermann, Andreas			Well-partial-orderings and the big Veblen number	ARCHIVE FOR MATHEMATICAL LOGIC			English	Article						Well-partial-orderings; Kruskal's theorem; Big Veblen number; Ordinal notation systems; Natural well-orderings; Maximal order type; Collapsing function; Recursively defined trees; Tree-embeddabilities	INCREASING FUNCTIONS; KRUSKAL THEOREM; FINITE; ORDINALS; BOUNDS; PROOF	In this article we characterize a countable ordinal known as the big Veblen number in terms of natural well-partially ordered tree-like structures. To this end, we consider generalized trees where the immediate subtrees are grouped in pairs with address-like objects. Motivated by natural ordering properties, extracted from the standard notations for the big Veblen number, we investigate different choices for embeddability relations on the generalized trees. We observe that for addresses using one finite sequence only, the embeddability coincides with the classical tree-embeddability, but in this article we are interested in more general situations (transfinite addresses and well-partially ordered addresses). We prove that the maximal order type of some of these new embeddability relations hit precisely the big Veblen ordinal . Somewhat surprisingly, changing a little bit the well-partially ordered addresses (going from multisets to finite sequences), the maximal order type hits an ordinal which exceeds the big Veblen number by far, namely . Our results contribute to the research program (originally initiated by Diana Schmidt) on classifying properties of natural well-orderings in terms of order-theoretic properties of the functions generating the orderings.

J	Cheng, Y; Gitman, V				Cheng, Yong; Gitman, Victoria			Indestructibility properties of remarkable cardinals	ARCHIVE FOR MATHEMATICAL LOGIC			English	Article						Large cardinals; Remarkable cardinals; Indestructibility; Laver functions		Remarkable cardinals were introduced by Schindler, who showed that the existence of a remarkable cardinal is equiconsistent with the assertion that the theory of is absolute for proper forcing (Schindler in Bull Symbolic Logic 6(2):176-184, 2000). Here, we study the indestructibility properties of remarkable cardinals. We show that if kappa is remarkable, then there is a forcing extension in which the remarkability of kappa becomes indestructible by all <kappa-closed a parts per thousand currency sign kappa-distributive forcing and all two-step iterations of the form , where is forced to be <kappa-closed and a parts per thousand currency sign kappa-distributive. In the process, we introduce the notion of a remarkable Laver function and show that every remarkable cardinal carries such a function. We also show that remarkability is preserved by the canonical forcing of the GCH.

Many of these cardinals are defined by modifying the definition of a high-jump cardinal. A high-jump cardinal is defined as the critical point of an elementary embedding such that M is closed under sequences of length . Some of the other cardinals analyzed include the super-high-jump cardinals, almost-high-jump cardinals, Shelah-for-supercompactness cardinals, Woodin-for-supercompactness cardinals, Vopnka cardinals, hypercompact cardinals, and enhanced supercompact cardinals. I organize these cardinals in terms of consistency strength and implicational strength. I also analyze the superstrong cardinals, which are weaker than supercompact cardinals but are related to high-jump cardinals. Among the results, I highlight the following. Vopnka cardinals are the same as Woodin-for-supercompactness cardinals. There are no excessively hypercompact cardinals. Furthermore, I prove some results relating high-jump cardinals to forcing, as well as analyzing Laver functions for super-high-jump cardinals.

(J Symb Log 70(2): 515-535, 2005) gave a complexity characterization of 2-random sequences in terms of plain Kolmogorov complexity C(.): they are sequences that have infinitely many initial segmentswith O(1)-maximal plain complexity (among the strings of the same length). Later Miller (Notre Dame J Form Log 50(4): 381-391, 2009) showed that prefix complexity K(.) can also be used in a similar way: a sequence is 2-random if and only if it has infinitely many initial segments with O(1)-maximal prefix complexity (which is n + K (n) for strings of length n). The known proofs of these results are quite involved; in this paper we provide elementary proofs. Miller (J Symb Log 69(3): 907-913, 2004, http://projecteuclid. org/euclid. jsl/1096901774) also gave a quantitative version of the first result: the 0'-randomness deficiency of a sequence. equals lim inf(n)[n - C (omega(1) ... omega(n))] + O(1). Our simplified proof can also be used to prove this. We show (and this seems to be a new result) that a similar quantitative result is also true for prefix complexity: 0'-randomness deficiency equals lim inf(n)[n + K (n) - K (omega(1) ... omega(n))] + O(1).

This improves (and also simplifies the proof of) the main result of Holy and Lucke (Fundam Math 226(3):221-236, 2014), where such a wellorder is introduced by a forcing which potentially collapses cardinals, and where the additional requirement that be regular is needed. As an application, we use this to infer that I pound (1)-definable wellorderings (using parameters) of can be introduced for many different cardinals simultaneously, while preserving a lot of ground model structure, improving results of Friedman and Holy (Fundam Math 215(2):133-166, 2011) and Friedman and Lucke (Ann Pure Appl Logic, accepted).

We use techniques of modal logic to formalize the logic of Reverse Mathematics into a system that we name s-logic. We argue that s-logic captures precisely the "logical" content of the implication and nonimplication relations between subsystems in Reverse Mathematics. We present a sound, complete, decidable, and compact tableau-style deductive system for s-logic, and explore in detail two fragments that are particularly relevant to Reverse Mathematics practice and automated theorem proving of Reverse Mathematics results.

J	Cacic, V; Kovac, V				Cacic, Vedran; Kovac, Vjekoslav			On the share of closed IL formulas which are also in GL	ARCHIVE FOR MATHEMATICAL LOGIC			English	Article						Interpretability logic; Normal forms; Asymptotic enumeration	FRAGMENT	Normal forms for wide classes of closed IL formulas were given in aiA double dagger and VukoviA double dagger (Math Commun 17:195-204, 2012). Here we quantify asymptotically, in exact numbers, how wide those classes are. As a consequence, we show that the "majority" of closed IL formulas have GL-equivalents, and by that, they have the same normal forms as GL formulas. Our approach is entirely syntactical, except for applying the results of aiA double dagger and VukoviA double dagger. As a byproduct we devise a convenient way of computing asymptotic behaviors of somewhat general classes of formulas given by their grammar rules. Its applications do not require any knowledge of the recurrence relations, generating functions, or the asymptotic enumeration methods, as all these are incorporated into two fundamental parameters.

J	Siders, A				Siders, Annika			Normalization proof for Peano Arithmetic	ARCHIVE FOR MATHEMATICAL LOGIC			English	Article						Normalization; Peano Arithmetic; Natural deduction	CONSISTENCY	A proof of normalization for a classical system of Peano Arithmetic formulated in natural deduction is given. The classical rule of the system is the rule for indirect proof restricted to atomic formulas. This rule does not, due to the restriction, interfere with the standard detour conversions. The convertible detours, numerical inductions and instances of indirect proof concluding falsity are reduced in a way that decreases a vector assigned to the derivation. By interpreting the expressions of the vectors as ordinals each derivation is assigned an ordinal less than E > (0). The vector assignment, which proves termination of the procedure, originates in a normalization proof for Godel's T by Howard (Intuitionism and proof theory. North-Holland, Amsterdam, 1970).

ARCHIVE FOR MATHEMATICAL LOGIC			English	Article						I-ultrafilters; P-hierarchy; CH; P-points; Monotonic sequential contour	UND ITERIERTE GRENZPROZESSE; NOWHERE DENSE ULTRAFILTERS; OMEGA	Under the continuum hypothesis we prove that for any tall P-ideal and for any ordinal there is an -ultrafilter in the sense of Baumgartner, which belongs to the class of the P-hierarchy of ultrafilters. Since the class of ultrafilters coincides with the class of P-points, our result generalizes the theorem of Flakova, which states that there are -ultrafilters which are not P-points.

Positive primitive formulae of modules over rings of semi-algebraic functions on a curve	ARCHIVE FOR MATHEMATICAL LOGIC			English	Article						Rings of continuous semi-algebraic functions; Semi-algebraic vector bundles; Piecewise vector bundles; p.p.-Formula; Model theory of modules; Semi-algebraic geometry	ORDERED STRUCTURES; DEFINABLE SETS	Let R be a real closed field, and semi-algebraic and 1-dimensional. We consider complete first-order theories of modules over the ring of continuous semi-algebraic functions definable with parameters in R. As a tool we introduce (pre)-piecewise vector bundles on X and show that the category of piecewise vector bundles on X is equivalent to the category of syzygies of finitely generated submodules of free modules. We give an explicit method to determine the Baur-Monk invariants of free modules in terms of pre-piecewise vector bundles. When R is a recursive real closed field this yields the decidability of the theory of free modules. Where it makes sense, we address the same questions for continuous definable functions in o-minimal expansions of a real closed field. From the free module case we are able to deduce generalisations of some results to arbitrary modules over the ring. We present a geometrically motivated quantifier elimination result down to the level of positive primitive formulae with a certain block decomposition of the matrix of coefficients.

We show that under some set-theoretical assumptions ( for example) in every uncountable Polish space X every family covering X has a subfamily with s-nonmeasurable union. We show the consistency of with the existence of a partition of the real line with a subfamily for which is s-nonmeasurable. We also show that it is relatively consistent with ZFC that and there exists a maximal almost disjoint family in the Baire space such that is sp-nonmeasurable. Under CH we show that there is m.a.d. family in Baire space which is not l-measurable and the same result holds for the ideal sp (0). Finally we prove the consistency of .

We will show that the theory VTC (0) extended with an axiom postulating the totality of iterated multiplication (which is computable in TC0) proves induction for quantifier-free formulas in the language (IOpen), and more generally, minimization for formulas in the language of Buss's S (2).
