To this end, we also prove some results in quaternionic functional analysis like an invariant subspace theorem for contractions in a Pontryagin space. We also consider slice hyperholomorphic functions on the half space of quaternions with positive real parts and we study the Hardy space H (2) and Blaschke products in this framework.

The equations are of second and fourth order in space and describe the behavior of the main components of the bridge: the deck, the sustaining cables and the connecting hangers. We compute all the energies involved and we derive the equations from variational principles. We then prove existence and uniqueness of a weak solution for the resulting problem.

MILAN JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICS			English	Article						Dynamic; dynamical; global attractor; Weyl law; Wentzell Laplacian; elliptic; parabolic; reaction-diffusion	PARABOLIC EQUATIONS; ELLIPTIC-SYSTEMS; LAPLACE EQUATION; GLOBAL ATTRACTOR	In this study, we investigate reaction-diffusion and elliptic-like equations with two classes of dynamic boundary conditions, of reactive and reactive-diffusive type. We provide sharp upper and lower bounds on the dimension of the global attractor in all these cases. In particular, we emphasize how surface diffusion can act as a damping force in reducing the degree of complexity in these systems. We obtain a new Weyl asymptotic law for eigenvalue sequences associated with a family of perturbed Wentzell operators which is of independent interest.

Our aim here is to go a step further: first, a result which can be interpreted as the exact analogy in pure Riemannian geometry to Hawking theorem will be proven and, then, the isomorphic role of the hypotheses in both theorems will be analyzed. This will provide some interesting links between Riemannian and Lorentzian geometries, as well as an introduction to the latter. The reader interested only in Riemannian Geometry can regard this new result as a simple application of Myers theorem combined with the properties of focal points. However, readers with broader perspectives will learn that when a geometer thinks in our space as a complete Riemannian manifold, a relativist may think in our spacetime as predictable, or that suitable bounds on the Ricci tensor will force geodesics either to converge in the space or to join in the time. Moreover, the limitation of the distance from any point to a hypersurface in a Riemannian manifold, may turn out into a catastrophic relativistic limit for the duration of our physical Universe.

Killing Vector Fields of Generic Semi-Riemannian Metrics	MILAN JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICS			English	Article						Isometry group; jet bundle; Killing vector field; pseudo-Riemannian metric; Ricci invariant	INVARIANTS; STABILITY; MAPPINGS; SPACE	Let M be a smooth oriented connected n-dimensional manifold and let be the space of pseudo-Riemannian metrics on M of a given signature . A system of n metric invariants is attached to each metric in , called the Ricci invariants, and by using the geometric properties of such invariants, the following result is proved: The subset of metrics with no Killing vector fields other than the trivial one is open and dense with respect to the strong topology.

We assume that V(x) is nonnegative and has a potential well consisting of k components such that the interior of Omega (i) is not empty and is smooth. By using a change of variables, the quasilinear equations are reduced to a semilinear one, whose associated functionals are well defined in the usual Sobolev space and satisfy the geometric conditions of the mountain pass theorem for suitable assumptions. We show that for any given non-empty subset. , a bump solution is trapped in a neighborhood of for large enough.

Similarly, we denote by u(d) the solution that satisfies the average property on a discrete grid and the same boundary data. We give optimal estimates for the difference parallel to u - u(d)parallel to(infinity).
