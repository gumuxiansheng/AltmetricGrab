Let f(u) denote the sum of the color on a vertex u and colors on all the edges incident to u. A k-neighbor sum distinguishing total coloring of G is a total k-coloring of G such that for each edge uv is an element of E(G), f (u) not equal f (v). BY X"(nsd)(G), we denote the smallest value k in such a coloring of G. Pilsniak and Wozniak conjectured that X"(nsd)(G) <= Delta(G) +3 for any simple graph with maximum degree Delta(G). In this paper, by using the famous Combinatorial Nullstellensatz, we prove that the conjecture holds for any triangle free planar graph with maximum degree at least 7.

Suppose that a regular (alpha, beta)-metric F is not of Randers type. We prove that F is a generalized Douglas-Weyl metric with vanishing S-curvature if and only if it is a Berwald metric. Moreover, by ignoring the regularity, if F is not a Berwald metric, then we find a family of almost regular Finsler metrics which is not Douglas nor Weyl. As its application, we show that generalized Douglas Weyl square metric or Matsumoto metric with isotropic mean Berwald curvature are Berwald metrics.

Corresponding extensions are given for the Bourgain-Brezis-Mironescu theorem and Pitt's inequality. New results are obtained for diagonal trace restriction on submanifolds as an application of the Hardy-Littlewood-Sobolev inequality. Smoothing estimates are used to provide new structural understanding for density functional theory, the Coulomb interaction energy and quantum mechanics of phase space.

These bounds are sharp when D is an identity matrix, see Cai and Zhang's work. These bounds are greatly improved comparing to the condition delta(k) < 0.307 or delta(2k) < 0.4931. Besides, if delta(k) < 1/3 or delta(2k) < root 2/2, the signals can also be stably reconstructed in the noisy cases.

First, we determine dimf (T) for any tree T. We show that for any connected graph G of order at least 3, where S(G) denotes the set of support vertices of G. We also show that, for any E > > 0, there exists a permutation graph G (sigma) such that dim (f) (G (sigma)) - 1 < epsilon. We give examples showing that neither is there a function h (1) such that dim (f) (G) < h (1)(dim (f) (G (sigma))) for all pairs (G, sigma), nor is there a function h (2) such that h (2)(dim (f) (G)) > dim (f) (G (sigma))) for all pairs (G, sigma). Furthermore, we investigate dim (f) (G (sigma))) when G is a complete k-partite graph or a cycle.

More precisely, let P-n (dH) = C(n)e(-nTrV(H)) dH be the distribution of n x n Hermitian random matrices, rho V(x)dx the equilibrium measure, where C-n is a normalization constant, V(x) = q(2m)x(2m) with q(2m) = Gamma(m)Gamma(1/2)/Gamma(2m+1/2), and m >= 1. Let x(1) <= ... <= x(n) be the eigenvalues of H. Let k := k(n) be such that k(n)/n is an element of [a, 1 - a] for n large enough, where a is an element of (0, 1/2). Define G(s) := integral(s)(-1) rho v(x)dx, -1 <= s <= 1, and set t := G(-1)(k/n). We prove that, as n -> infinity, x(k) - t/root log n/root 2 pi(2)n rho V(t) -> N(0, 1) in distribution. Multi-dimensional central limit theorem is also proved. Our results can be viewed as natural extensions of the bulk central limit theorems for GUE ensemble established by J. Gustavsson in 2005.

C.: Caristi type coincidence point theorem in topological spaces. J. Applied Math., 2013, ID 902692 (2013)]), we give a new version of vectorial Ekeland's variational principle. In the new version, the objective function is defined on a sequentially lower complete space and taking values in a quasi-ordered locally convex space, and the perturbation consists of a weakly countably compact set and a non-negative function p which only needs to satisfy p(x, y) = 0 iff x = y. Here, the function p need not satisfy the subadditivity. From the new Ekeland's principle, we deduce a vectorial Caristi's fixed point theorem and a vectorial Takahashi's non-convex minimization theorem. Moreover, we show that the above three theorems are equivalent to each other. By considering some particular cases, we obtain a number of corollaries, which include some interesting versions of fixed point theorem.

A Cayley graph over G is a simple graph whose automorphism group has a regular subgroup isomorphic to G. A Cayley graph is called a CI-graph (Cayley isomorphism) if its isomorphic images are induced by automorphisms of G. A well-known result of Babai states that a Cayley graph I" of G is a CI-graph if and only if all regular subgroups of Aut(I") isomorphic to G are conjugate in Aut(I"). A semi-Cayley graph (also called bi-Cayley graph by some authors) over G is a simple graph whose automorphism group has a semiregular subgroup isomorphic to G with two orbits (of equal size). In this paper, we introduce the concept of SCI-graph (semi-Cayley isomorphism) and prove a Babai type theorem for semi-Cayley graphs. We prove that every semi-Cayley graph of a finite group G is an SCI-graph if and only if G is cyclic of order 3. Also, we study the isomorphism problem of a special class of semi-Cayley graphs.

ACTA MATHEMATICA SINICA-ENGLISH SERIES			English	Article						James constant; symmetric absolute norms; piecewise linear functions	ABSOLUTE NORMS; DIRECT SUMS; SMOOTHNESS; CONSTANTS; JAMES	In this paper, we consider the following problem about the James constant: When does the equality J(X*) = J(X) hold for a Banach space X? It is known that the James constant of a Banach space does not coincide with that of its dual space in general. In fact, we already have counterexamples of two-dimensional normed spaces that are equipped with either symmetric or absolute norms. However, we show that if the norm on a two-dimensional space X is both symmetric and absolute, then the equality J(X*) = J(X) holds. This provides a global answer to the problem in the two-dimensional case.

The crucial part is that we prove the boundedness of the fractional integral operator on variable exponent Lebesgue spaces on spaces of homogeneous type. We obtain the first order Poincar, inequalities for vector fields satisfying Hormander's condition in variable non-isotropic Sobolev spaces. We also set up the higher order Poincar, inequalities with variable exponents on stratified Lie groups. Moreover, we get the Sobolev inequalities in variable exponent Sobolev spaces on whole stratified Lie groups. These inequalities are important and basic tools in studying nonlinear subelliptic PDEs with variable exponents such as the p(x)-subLaplacian. Our results are only stated and proved for vector fields satisfying Hormander's condition, but they also hold for Grushin vector fields as well with obvious modifications.

The proposed algorithm is based on a new kernel function which differs from the existing kernel functions in which it has a double barrier term. With this function we define a new search direction and also a new proximity function for analyzing its complexity. We show that if q (1) > q (2) > 1, the algorithm has and complexity results for large- and small-update methods, respectively.

Quantitative estimates play a crucial role on the real applications. Our objective is the derivation of explicit expressions of the involved constants in the quantitative estimates, the so-called absolute or universal bounds. The dependence on the leading coefficient and on the size of the spatial domain is precise.

He gave a differential-operator representation of the symmetric group S-n on the corresponding space of truncated power series and proved that the solution space of the system is spanned by {sigma(1) | sigma is an element of S-n }. It is known that S-n is also the Weyl group of sl(n, C) and generated by all reflections s(alpha) with positive roots alpha. We present an explicit formula of the solution s(alpha)(1) for every positive root alpha and show directly that s(alpha)(1) is a polynomial if and only if <lambda + rho, alpha > is a nonnegative integer. From this, we can recover a formula of singular vectors given by Malikov et al..

J	Li, P				Li, Ping			Circle Action with Prescribed Number of Fixed Points	ACTA MATHEMATICA SINICA-ENGLISH SERIES			English	Article						Circle action; fixed point; weight		Given any two positive integers k and n, this paper is concerned with the existence of a circle action on a closed, smooth orientable n-dimensional manifold with precisely k isolated fixed points. We first show that this existence problem can be reduced to that of an n-dimensional manifold with exactly three fixed points. Then by using a rigidity result, we determine possible weights on these three fixed points when n = 4.

The relationship between the Hausdorff measure of noncompactness of intersections and the modulus of equicontinuity is studied for some subsets related to the semigroup of linear operators in Banach spaces. The existence of mild solutions is obtained for a class of nonlocal semilinear functional differential equations without the assumption of compactness or equicontinuity on the associated semigroups of linear operators.

Nonlinear ODE models are widely used in applications. But their analytic solutions are usually not available. Thus regular methods usually depend on repetitive use of numerical solutions which bring huge computational cost. We proposed a new two-stage approach which includes a smoothing method (kernel smoothing or local polynomial fitting) in the first stage, and a numerical discretization method (Eulers discretization method, the trapezoidal discretization method, or the Runge-Kutta discretization method) in the second stage. Through numerical simulations, we find the proposed method gains a proper balance between estimation accuracy and computational cost. Asymptotic properties are also presented, which show the consistency and asymptotic normality of estimators under some mild conditions. The proposed method is compared to existing methods in term of accuracy and computational cost. The simulation results show that the estimators with local linear smoothing in the first stage and trapezoidal discretization in the second stage have the lowest average relative errors. We apply the proposed method to HIV dynamics data to illustrate the practicability of the estimator.

The key results of this section are derived by considering an equivalent problem where the square of distance function represents a viscosity solution to an adequately defined partial differential equation. The second part of the paper analyzes the broader context when solutions are constrained by more general time-dependent convex domains. The approach relies on forward stochastic variational inequalities with oblique reflection, the generalized subgradients acting as a reacting process that operates only when the solution reaches the boundary of the domain.

It makes a great difference from other papers by using the estimates of the kernel and the weight together instead of separately estimating each other. We also get the equivalent conditions when a Toeplitz operator is in the Schatten-p class.

Being quite different from the previous versions of vectorial Ekeland's variational principle, the perturbation in our version is no longer only dependent on a fixed positive vector or a fixed family of positive vectors. It contains a family of set-valued functions taking values in the positive cone and a family of subadditive functions of topology generating quasi-metrics. Hence, the direction of the perturbation in the new version is a family of variable subsets which are dependent on the objective function values. The general version includes and improves a number of known versions of vectorial Ekeland's variational principle. From the general Ekeland's principle, we deduce the corresponding versions of Caristi-Kirk's fixed point theorem and Takahashi's nonconvex minimization theorem. Finally, we prove that all the three theorems are equivalent to each other.

Context-free grammars for triangular arrays	ACTA MATHEMATICA SINICA-ENGLISH SERIES			English	Article						Context-free grammar; stable polynomials; real-rootedness; Bessel numbers; Whitney numbers	STABLE POLYNOMIALS; BESSEL POLYNOMIALS	We consider context-free grammars of the form , where a (i) and b (i) are integers subject to certain positivity conditions. Such a grammar G gives rise to triangular arrays {T(n, k)}(0a parts per thousand currency signka parts per thousand currency signn) satisfying a three-term recurrence relation. Many combinatorial sequences can be generated in this way. Let T (n) (x) = I pound (k=0) (n) T(n, k)x (k) . Based on the differential operator with respect to G, we define a sequence of linear operators P (n) such that T (n+1)(x) = P (n) (T (n) (x)). Applying the characterization of real stability preserving linear operators on the multivariate polynomials due to Borcea and Brand,n, we obtain a necessary and sufficient condition for the operator P (n) to be real stability preserving for any n. As a consequence, we are led to a sufficient condition for the real-rootedness of the polynomials defined by certain triangular arrays, obtained by Wang and Yeh. Moreover, as special cases we obtain grammars that lead to identities involving the Whitney numbers and the Bessel numbers.	[Hao, Robert X. J.; Wang, Larry X. W.; Yang, Harold R.

A variable selection procedure is developed using basis function approximations and group nonconcave penalized functions, and the fixed effects are removed using the proper weight matrices. The proposed procedure simultaneously removes the fixed individual effects, selects the significant variables and estimates the nonzero coefficient functions. With appropriate selection of the tuning parameters, an asymptotic theory for the resulting estimates is established under suitable conditions. Simulation studies are carried out to assess the performance of our proposed method, and a real data set is analyzed for further illustration.

Then Callan defined the flattened Pi to be the permutation of [n] obtained by erasing the divers between its blocks, and Callan also enumerated the number of set partitions of [n] whose flattening avoids a single 3-letter pattern. Mansour posed the question of counting set partitions of [n] whose flattening avoids a pattern of length 4.

In this paper, we define a unital C*-algebra C-cb*(A, r) and a completely bounded unital homomorphism ar : A -> C-cb*(A,r) with the property that C-cb*(A, r) = C*(alpha(r)(A)) and, for every unital C*-algebra B and every unital completely bounded homomorphism : A B, there is a (unique) unital *-homomorphism pi : C-cb* (A,r) -> B such that phi = pi o alpha(r). We prove that, if A is generated by a normal set {t(lambda) : lambda is an element of Lambda}, then C-cb*(A,r) is generated by the set (ar(t),) : lambda is an element of Lambda}. By proving an equation of the norms of elements in a dense subset of C-cb*(A,r) we obtain that, if B is a unital C*-algebra that can be embedded into A, then C-cb*(B, r) can be naturally embedded into C-cb*(A,r). We give characterizations of C-cb*(A,r) for some special situations and we conclude that C-cb*(A,r) will be "nice" when dim(A) <= 2 and "quite complicated" when dim(A) >= 3. We give a characterization of the relation between K-groups of A and K-groups of C-cb*(A,r). We also define and study some analogous of C-cb*(A,r).

The sum of the weights of the edges incident with a vertex v is called the weighted degree of v, denoted by d(w) (v). The weight of a cycle is defined as the sum of the weights of its edges. Fujisawa proved that if G is a 2-connected triangle-free weighted graph such that the minimum weighted degree of G is at least d, then G contains a cycle of weight at least 2d. In this paper, we proved that if G is a 2-connected triangle-free weighted graph of even size such that d(w) (u) + d(w) (v) >= 2d holds for any pair of nonadjacent vertices u, v epsilon V(G), then G contains a cycle of weight at least 2d.

The relationship between the extreme value problem and width theory is revealed by using the methods of functional analysis. Particularly, as sigma = 0 or sigma = 1, the exact values of Kolmogorov's widths, Gelfand's widths, and linear widths are obtained respectively, and the related extremal subspaces and optimal linear operators are given.

In this paper, we deal with the eigenvalue of the anisotropic scattering transport equation in slab geometry. We propose a new discrete method which was called modified discrete ordinates method. It is constructed by redeveloping and improving discrete ordinates method in the space of L-1(X). Different from traditional methods, norm convergence of operator approximation is proved theoretically. Furthermore, convergence of eigenvalue approximation and the corresponding error estimation are obtained by analytical tools.

Discusses the relationships of (FDI) operators, (IDI) operators and strongly irreducible operators ((SI) operators) and illustrates some properties of the three classes of operators. Some sufficient conditions for the finite-dimensional irreducibility of operators which have the forms of upper triangular operator matrices are given. This paper proves that every operator with a singleton spectrum is a small compact perturbation of an (FDI) operator on separable Banach spaces and shows that every bounded linear operator T can be approximated by operators in (I FDI)(X) pound with respect to the strong-operator topology and every compact operator K can be approximated by operators in (I FDI)(X) pound with respect to the norm topology on a Banach space X with a Schauder basis, where (I FDI)(X) pound:= {T a B(X): T = I pound (i=1) (k) aS center dot T (i) , T (i) a (FDI), k is an element of N}.

For designs with qualitative factors under an ANOVA model, the minimum aberration criterion has been frequently used; however, for designs with quantitative factors, a polynomial regression model is often established, thus the beta-wordlength pattern can be employed to compare different fractional factorial designs. Although the beta-wordlength pattern was introduced in 2004, its properties have not been investigated extensively. In this paper, we will present some properties of beta-wordlength pattern for four-level designs. These properties can help find better designs with quantitative factors.

Fleischner (Discrete Math., 101, 33-37 (1992)) has extended this result to bridgeless graphs of minimum degree at least three by showing that every such graph has an even factor without isolated vertices. Let m(e) > 0 be even and m(o) > 0 be odd. In this paper, we prove that every m(e)-edge-connected graph with minimum degree at least m(e) + 1 contains an even factor with minimum degree at least m (e) and every (m(o) + 1)-edge-connected graph contains an odd factor with minimum degree at least m(o) , which further extends Fleischner's result. Moreover, we show that our results are best possible.

We first present a more complete and clearer picture of a dimension tree, with which we are then able, on the one hand, to sharpen some results obtained before and furthermore reveal a few more hidden subtle homological phenomenons of or connections between the involved algebras; on the other hand, to provide two more efficient combinatorial algorithms for computing dimension trees, and consequently the homological dimensions as an application. We believe that the more refined complete structural information on dimension trees will be useful to study other homological properties of this class of extension algebras.

Our model features that, when marginalized over the random effect variable, it still enjoys the structure of the additive hazards model. We develop the estimating equations for inferring the regression parameters. The proposed estimators are shown to be consistent and asymptotically normal under appropriate regularity conditions. Furthermore, the estimator of the baseline hazards function is proposed and its asymptotic properties are also established. We propose a class of diagnostic methods to assess the overall fitting adequacy of the additive hazards model with random effects. We conduct simulation studies to evaluate the finite sample behaviors of the proposed estimators in various scenarios. Analysis of the Diabetic Retinopathy Study is provided as an illustration for the proposed method.

Consistent estimators for the asymptotic variance-covariance matrices of both the parametric and unknown components are provided.

For a set omega = ((d) over right arrow (1),..., (d) over right arrow (m)) of sequences of positive integers, denote by L omega the ample line bundle corresponding to the polarization on the product X = Pi(m)(i=1)Flag(V, (n) over right arrow (i)) of flag varieties of type (n) over right arrow (i) determined by omega. We study the SL(V)-linearization of the diagonal action of SL(V) on X with respect to L. We give a sufficient and necessary condition on w such that X-ss (L-omega) not equal empty set (resp., X-s (L-omega) not equal empty set). As a consequence, we characterize the SL(V)-ample cone (for the diagonal action of SL(V) on X), which turns out to be a polyhedral convex cone.

At the same time, self-similar solutions are induced if the initial velocity is, besides, a homogeneous function of degree -1. Also the uniqueness is discussed.

J	Li, ZX				Li, Zhao Xiang			The Cycle Structure for Directed Graphs on Surfaces	ACTA MATHEMATICA SINICA-ENGLISH SERIES			English	Article						Directed graph; strongly connected; directed cycles; cycles space	TREE GRAPHS	In this paper, the cycle structures for directed graphs on surfaces are studied. If G is a strongly connected graph, C is a Pi-contractible directed cycle of G, then both of Int(C, Pi) and Ext(C, Pi) are strongly connected graph; the dimension of cycles space of G is identified. If G is a strongly connected graph, then the structure of MCB in G is unique. Let G be a strongly connected graph, if G has been embedded in orientable surface S-g with f(w)(G) >= 2 (f(w)(G) is the face-width of G), then any cycle base of G must contain at least 2g noncontractible directed cycles; if G has been embedded in non-orientable surface N-g, then any cycle base of G must contain at least g noncontractible directed cycles.

The basic idea is the decomposition of a dependent branching dynamic into a no-interacting branching and an interacting dynamic generated by the random environments. CLLF will play an important role in the investigation of branching processes and superprocesses with interaction.
