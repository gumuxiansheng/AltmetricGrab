First we construct the Rayleigh-Taylor steady-state solutions with a denser fluid lying above the free interface with the second fluid, then we turn to an analysis of the equations obtained from linearization around such a steady state. In the presence of uniform rotation, there is no natural variational framework for constructing growing mode solutions to the linearized problem. Using the general method of studying a family of modified variational problems introduced in [1], we construct normal mode solutions that grow exponentially in time with rate like e(t root c vertical bar xi vertical bar-1), where is the spatial frequency of the normal mode and the constant c depends on some physical parameters of the two layer fluids. A Fourier synthesis of these normal mode solutions allows us to construct solutions that grow arbitrarily quickly in the Sobolev space H-k, and leads to an ill-posedness result for the linearized problem. Moreover, from the analysis we see that rotation diminishes the growth of instability. Using the pathological solutions, we then demonstrate the ill-posedness for the original non-linear problem in some sense.

We establish generalized fractional calculus formulas involving the product of aleph-function, Appell function F-3 and a general class of polynomials. The results obtained provide unification and extension of the results given by Saxena et al. [13], Srivastava and Crag [17], Srivastava et al. [20], and etc. The results are obtained in compact form and are useful in preparing some tables of operators of fractional calculus. On account of the general nature of the Saigo-Maeda operators, aleph-function, and a general class of polynomials a large number of new and known results involving Saigo fractional calculus operators and several special functions notably H-function, I-function, Mittag-Leffler function, generalized Wright hypergeometric function, generalized Bessel-Maitland function follow as special cases of our main findings.

Assume that the insurer's surplus process follows a jump-diffusion process, the insurer can purchase proportional reinsurance from the reinsurer via the variance principle and invest in a risk-free asset and a risky asset whose price is modeled by a CEV model. The diffusion term can explain the uncertainty associated with the surplus of the insurer or the additional small claims. The objective of the insurer is to maximize the expected exponential uality of terminal wealth. This optimization problem is studied in two cases depending on the diffusion term's explanation. In all cases, by using techniques of stochastic control theory, closed-form expressions for the value functions and optimal strategies are obtained.

CONSENSUS ANALYSIS AND DESIGN OF LINEAR INTERCONNECTED MULTI-AGENT SYSTEMS	ACTA MATHEMATICA SCIENTIA			English	Article						linear interconnected multi-agent system (LIMAS); partial stability; state-linear-transformation; criterion of consensus convergence; consensus design	SYNCHRONIZATION; LEADER	We deal with the state consensus problem of a general Linear Interconnected Multi-Agent System (LIMAS) under a time-invariant and directed communication topology. Firstly, we propose a linear consensus protocol in a general form, which consists of state feedback of the agent itself and feedback form of the relative states between the agent and its neighbors. Secondly, a state-linear-transformation is applied to equivalently transform the state consensus problem into a partial stability problem. Based on the partial stability theory, we derive a sufficient and necessary criterion of consensus convergence, which is expressed via the Hurwitz stability of a real matrix constructed from the parameters of the agent models and the protocols, and present an analytical formula of the consensus function. Lastly, we propose a design procedure of the gain matrices in the protocol by solving a bilinear matrix inequality.

Moreover, an optimal control law satisfying the generalized Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation with Markovian switching is characterized. Then, through the generalized HJB equation, we study an optimal consumption and portfolio problem with the financial markets of Markovian switching and inflation.

We investigated, by means of the techniques of symmetrizer and elaborate energy method, the Cauchy problem in R-3. Under the assumption that the initial values are close to a equilibrium solutions, we prove that the smooth solutions of this problem converge to a steady state as the time goes to the infinity. It is shown that the difference of densities of two carriers converge to the equilibrium states with the norm parallel to.parallel to(Hs-1), while the velocities and the electromagnetic fields converge to the equilibrium states with weaker norms than parallel to.parallel to(Hs-1). This phenomenon on the charge transport shows the essential difference between the unipolar Navier-Stokes-Maxwell and the bipolar Navier-Stokes-Maxwell system.

The system models the dynamics of phase transitions in an isothermal fluid; in Lagrangian coordinates, the phase interfaces are represented as stationary contact discontinuities. We focus on the persistence of solutions consisting in three bulk phases separated by two interfaces. Under some stability conditions on the phase configuration and by a suitable front tracking algorithm we show that, if the BV-norm of the initial data is less than an explicit (large) threshold, then the Cauchy problem has global solutions.

For the 2 x 2 quasilinear non-reducible hyperbolic system, there not necessarily exists any simple wave solution. We prove the result that there are simple wave solutions for this 4 x 4 non-reducible hyperbolic system, its simple wave flow is covered by four straight characteristics lambda(0) = lambda(1), lambda(2), lambda(3) and the solutions keep constants along these lines.

Energy E is shown to be the only nontrivial entropy for that system in multiple space dimensions, and it is strictly convex in p,v if and only if vertical bar v vertical bar < c. For motivation some simple variations on the relative entropy theme of Dafermos/DiPerna are given, for example that smooth regions of weak entropy solutions shrink at finite speed, and that smooth solutions force solutions of singular entropy-compatible perturbations to converge to them. We conjecture that entropy weak solutions of compressible potential flow are unique, in contrast to the known counterexamples for the Euler equations.

This leads to a mixed boundary value problem to the Helmholtz equation in the domain D with a crack Gamma. Both sides of the crack are given Dirichlet-impedance boundary conditions, and different boundary condition (Dirichlet, Neumann or Impedance boundary condition) is set on the boundary of D. Applying potential theory, the problem can be reformulated as a system of boundary integral equations.

From the maximum modulus principle of holomorphic functions, we obtain that the generalized Roper-Suffridge operators preserve strong and almost spirallikeness of type beta and order alpha on the unit ball B-n in C-n and on bounded and complete Reinhardt domains. Therefore we obtain that the generalized Roper-Suffridge operators preserve strong spirallikeness of type beta, strong and almost starlikeness of order alpha, strong starlikeness on the corresponding domains. Thus we can construct more subclasses of spirallike mappings in several complex variables.

Many fundamental results about this new integral transform, which are established in this paper, include (for example) existence theorem, Parseval-type relationship and inversion formula. The relationship between the new integral transform with the H-function and the H-transform are characterized by means of some integral identities. The introduced transform is also used to find solution to a certain differential equation. Some illustrative examples are also given.	[Srivastava, H.

By defining some suitable functionals and a constrained variational problem, we first establish the existence of standing waves, which relys on the inner structure of the equations under consideration to overcome the drawback that nonlocal terms violate the space-scale invariance. We then show the orbital instability of standing waves. The arguments depend upon the conservation laws of the mass and of the energy.

In the same paper, the authors presented a lower bound for the product of the eigenvalues of the solutions to these matrix equations. Inspired by their work, we give some generalizations of Dehghan and Hajarian results.

Even though in this radiation hydrodynamics model, the radiative effects can be understood as source terms to the isentropic Euler equations of hydrodynamics, in general the radiation field has singularities propagated in an angular domain issuing from the initial point across which the density is discontinuous. This is the major difficulty in the stability analysis of shocks. Under certain assumptions on the radiation parameters, we show there exists a local weak solution to the initial value problem of the one dimensional Euler-Boltzmann equations, in which the radiation intensity is continuous, while the density and velocity are piecewise Lipschitz continuous with a strong discontinuity representing the shock-front. The existence of such a solution indicates that shock waves are structurally stable, at least local in time, in radiation hydrodynamics.

A dual mixed fractional flow velocity-pressure model is considered with an air-fresh water and a fresh water-seawater characterization. For analysis and computational purposes, spatial decompositions based on nonoverlapping multidomains, above and below the sea level, are variationally introduced with internal boundary fluxes dualized as weak transmission constraints. Further, parallel augmented and exactly penalized duality algorithms, and proximation semi-implicit time marching schemes, are established and analyzed.

To prove the applicability of the HWAM, a more general applicability theorem on an approximation method (AM) for an operator equation Ax = y is proved first. As an application, applicability of the HWAM is obtained. Furthermore, four steps to use the HWAM are listed and three numerical examples are given in order to illustrate the effectiveness of the method.

Hua. First it is discussed for the version of one variable in order to induce the relation between the analytic boundary value problem and the decomposition of function space L-2 on the boundary manifold. Then an easy example of several variables, the version of torus in C-2, is stated. For the noncommutative classical group L-I, the characteristic boundary of a kind of bounded symmetric domain in C-4, the boundary behaviors of the Cauchy integral are obtained by using both the harmonic expansion and polar coordinate transformation. At last we obtain the conditions of solvability of Schwarz problem on L-I, if so, the solution is given explicitly.

Demicompactness condition imposed in such results is dispensed with. Furthermore, Applications of our theorems to approximation of common fixed point of countable infinite family of continuous pseudocontractive mappings and approximation of common solution of countable infinite family of generalized mixed equilibrium problems are also discussed.

Each leader has a constrained correspondence. By using a collective fixed point theorem in locally FC-uniform spaces due to author, some existence theorems of equilibrium points for the multi-leader-follower generalized constrained multiobjective games are established under nonconvex settings. These results generalize some corresponding results in recent literature.

The jump mechanism in our article is different from that of Liu et al [4]. Comparing with [4], the introduction of the investment, and hence, the additional Brownian motion term, makes the problem technically challenging. To overcome this technical difficulty, the theory of change of measure is used and an exponential martingale is obtained by virtue of the extended generator. The ruin probability is minimized through maximizing adjustment coefficient in the sense of Lundberg bounds. At the same time, the optimal investment strategy is obtained.

Moreover, a multi-dimensional Markov chain model is developed to analyze the performance of the proposed scheme. Meanwhile, performance metrics are derived. Numerical results show that the proposed scheme can effectively reduce the forced termination probability, blocking probability and spectrum utilization.
