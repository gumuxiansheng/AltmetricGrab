The invariants appearing in this classification are computed in the case when L is simple classical (except for type D (4), where a partial result is given). In particular, we obtain criteria to determine when a finite-dimensional simple L-module admits a G-grading making it a graded L-module.

J	Roche-Newton, O; Rudnev, M				Roche-Newton, Oliver; Rudnev, Misha			On the Minkowski distances and products of sum sets	ISRAEL JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICS			English	Article							FINITE-FIELDS; DIRECTIONS; POINTS	Given two points p, q in the real plane, the signed area of the rectangle with the diagonal [pq] equals the square of the Minkowski distance between the points p, q. We prove that N > 1 points in the Minkowski plane a"e(1,1) generate distinct distances, or all the distances are zero. The proof follows the lines of the Elekes/Sharir/Guth/Katz approach to the ErdAs distance problem, analysing the 3D incidence problem, arising by considering the action of the Minkowski isometry group ISO*(1, 1). The signature of the metric creates an obstacle to applying the Guth/Katz incidence theorem to the 3D problem at hand, since one may encounter a high count of congruent line intervals, lying on null lines, or "light cones", all these intervals having zero Minkowski length. In terms of the Guth/Katz theorem, its condition of the non-existence of "rich planes" generally gets violated. It turns out, however, that one can efficiently identify and discount incidences, corresponding to null intervals, and devise a counting strategy, where the rich planes condition happens to be just ample enough for the strategy to succeed. As a corollary we establish the following near-optimal sum-product type estimate for finite sets A, B aS, a"e, with more than one element: broken vertical bar(A +/- B)vertical bar .

Nonsoluble and non-p-soluble length of finite groups	ISRAEL JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICS			English	Article							SYLOW 2-SUBGROUP; SOLVABLE GROUP; 2-LENGTH	Every finite group G has a normal series each of whose factors either is soluble or is a direct product of nonabelian simple groups. We define the nonsoluble length lambda(G) as the number of nonsoluble factors in a shortest series of this kind. Upper bounds for lambda(G) appear in the study of various problems on finite, residually finite, and profinite groups. We prove that lambda(G) is bounded in terms of the maximum 2-length of soluble subgroups of G, and that lambda(G) is bounded by the maximum Fitting height of soluble subgroups. For an odd prime p, the non-p-soluble length lambda (p) (G) is introduced, and it is proved that lambda (p) (G) does not exceed the maximum p-length of p-soluble subgroups. We conjecture that for a given prime p and a given proper group variety V the non-p-soluble length lambda (p) (G) of finite groups G whose Sylow p-subgroups belong to V is bounded. In this paper we prove this conjecture for any variety that is a product of several soluble varieties and varieties of finite exponent. As an application of the results obtained, an error is corrected in the proof of the main result of the second author's paper Multilinear commutators in residually finite groups, Israel Journal of Mathematics 189 (2012), 207-224.

On infinite transformations with maximal control of ergodic two-fold product powers	ISRAEL JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICS			English	Article								We study the rich behavior of ergodicity and conservativity of Cartesian products of infinite measure-preserving transformations. A class of transformations is constructed such that for any subset R aS, a"e a (c) (0, 1) there exists T in this class such that T (p) x T (q) is ergodic if and only if a R. This contrasts with the finite measure-preserving case where T (p) x T (q) is ergodic for all nonzero p and q if and only if T x T is ergodic. We also show that our class is rich in the behavior of conservative products. For each positive integer k, a family of rank-one infinite measure-preserving transformations is constructed which have ergodic index k, but infinite conservative index.

On weighted covering numbers and the Levi-Hadwiger conjecture	ISRAEL JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICS			English	Article							CONCAVE FUNCTIONS; CONVEX-SETS; INEQUALITY; FORM	We define new natural variants of the notions of weighted covering and separation numbers and discuss them in detail. We prove a strong duality relation between weighted covering and separation numbers and prove a few relations between the classical and weighted covering numbers, some of which hold true without convexity assumptions and for general metric spaces. As a consequence, together with some volume bounds that we discuss, we provide a bound for the famous Levi-Hadwiger problem concerning covering a convex body by homothetic slightly smaller copies of itself, in the case of centrally symmetric convex bodies, which is qualitatively the same as the best currently known bound. We also introduce the weighted notion of the Levi-Hadwiger covering problem, and settle the centrally-symmetric case, thus also confirm the equivalent fractional illumination conjecture [19, Conjecture 7] in the case of centrally symmetric convex bodies (including the characterization of the equality case, which was unknown so far).

A subset X aS, G is called Haar null (in the sense of Christensen) if there exists a Borel set B aS integral X and a Borel probability measure A mu on G such that A mu(B + g) = 0 for every g a G. The term shy is also commonly used for Haar null, and co-Haar null sets are often called prevalent. Answering an old question of Mycielski we show that if G is not locally compact then there exists a Borel Haar null set that is not contained in any Haar null set. We also show that can be replaced by any other class of the Borel hierarchy, which implies that the additivity of the sigma-ideal of Haar null sets is omega (1). The definition of a generalised Haar null set is obtained by replacing the Borelness of B in the above definition by universal measurability. We give an example of a generalised Haar null set that is not Haar null, more precisely, we construct a coanalytic generalised Haar null set without a Borel Haar null hull. This solves Problem GP from Fremlin's problem list. Actually, all our results readily generalise to all Polish groups that admit a two-sided invariant metric.

An upper bound is the wave number k. When the curve has nowhere zero curvature, we conjecture that, up to a constant multiple, this should also be the correct lower bound. We give a lower bound which differs from this by an arithmetic quantity, given in terms of the maximal number of lattice points in arcs of size square root of the wave number k on a circle of radius k. According to a conjecture of Cilleruelo and Granville, this quantity is bounded, in which case we recover our conjecture. To get at the lower bound, we reduce the problem to giving a lower bound for the L (1) norm of the restriction of the eigenfunction to the curve, and then to an upper bound for the L (4) restriction norm.

In particular, these are the two main tools in the recent classification of permutation classes of growth rate less than kappa a parts per thousand 2.20557 (a specific algebraic integer at which infinite antichains first appear). Using language- and order-theoretic methods, we prove that the substitution closures of geometric grid classes are well partially ordered, finitely based, and that all their subclasses have algebraic generating functions. We go on to show that the inflation of a geometric grid class by a strongly rational class is well partially ordered, and that all its subclasses have rational generating functions. This latter fact allows us to conclude that every permutation class with growth rate less than kappa has a rational generating function. This bound is tight as there are permutation classes with growth rate kappa which have nonrational generating functions.

The Quillen categories of p-groups and coclass theory	ISRAEL JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICS			English	Article							COHOMOLOGY	Coclass theory can be used to define infinite families of finite p-groups of a fixed coclass. It is conjectured that the groups in one of these infinite families all have isomorphic mod-p cohomology rings. Here we prove that almost all groups in one of these infinite families have equivalent Quillen categories. We also show how the Quillen categories of the groups in an infinite family are connected to the Quillen category of their associated infinite pro-p-group of finite coclass.

We prove that ( i) and ( ii) are equivalent, and that the order of a non- Dedekind finite p- group satisfying any of these three conditions is bounded for p > 2. ( For condition ( i) this fact was proved earlier by Zhang and Guo [ 14].) More precisely, we get the best possible bound for the order of G in all three cases, which is | G| = p(2k+2). The order of the group cannot be bounded for p = 2, but we are able to identify two infinite families of 2- groups out of which | G| <= 2(f(k)) for some function f( k) depending only on k.

We show that for large enough lambda there exist 2r positive solutions, irrespective of the behavior of f at zero or infinity, provided only that f verifies a suitable non-integrability condition near each of its zeros, thereby generalizing previous known results. The construction of the solutions rely on the sub- and supersolutions method and topological degree arguments, together with the use of a new Liouville theorem which is an extension of recent results to this type of nonlinearities.

Although there are several algorithms for computing this decomposition in the literature, it is difficult to predict the output of these algorithms. We call a decomposition of the form a 'Jordan partition'. We prove several deep results concerning the p-parts of the lambda (i) where p is the characteristic of the underlying field. Our main results include the proof of two conjectures made by McFall in 1980, and the proof that lcm(r, s) and gcd(lambda (1), aEuro broken vertical bar, lambda (b) ) have equal p-parts. Finally, we establish some explicit formulas for Jordan partitions when p = 2.	[Glasby, S.

Similar problems were recently studied in group theory, where we aim to present group elements as short products of values of a given word w not equal 1. In this paper we study this problem for Lie groups and Chevalley groups over infinite fields. We show that for a fixed word w not equal 1 and for a classical connected real compact Lie group G of sufficiently large rank we have w(G)(2) = G, namely every element of G is a product of 2 values of w. We prove a similar result for non-compact Lie groups of arbitrary rank, arising from Chevalley groups over a"e or over a p-adic field. We also study this problem for Chevalley groups over arbitrary infinite fields, and show in particular that every element in such a group is a product of two squares.

J	La Mattina, D				La Mattina, Daniela			Almost polynomial growth: Classifying varieties of graded algebras	ISRAEL JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICS			English	Article							PI-ALGEBRAS; CODIMENSION GROWTH; EXPONENTIAL-GROWTH; IDENTITIES; SUPERALGEBRAS; MATRICES	Let G be a finite group, V a variety of associative G-graded algebras and c (n) (G) (V), n = 1, 2, aEuro broken vertical bar, its sequence of graded codimensions. It was recently shown by Valenti that such a sequence is polynomially bounded if and only if V does not contain a finite list of G-graded algebras. The list consists of group algebras of groups of order a prime number, the infinite-dimensional Grassmann algebra and the algebra of 2 x 2 upper triangular matrices with suitable gradings. Such algebras generate the only varieties of G-graded algebras of almost polynomial growth, i.e., varieties of exponential growth such that any proper subvariety is polynomially bounded. In this paper we completely classify all subvarieties of the G-graded varieties of almost polynomial growth by giving a complete list of finite-dimensional G-graded algebras generating them.

It is also proved that a"" (q) is not a coarse quotient of a"" (q) for 1 < p < q < a using Rolewicz's property (beta).

In the archimedean case, an analog of the highest derivative was defined for irreducible unitary representations in [Sah89] and called the "adduced" representation. In [AGS] derivatives of all orders were defined for smooth admissible Fr,chet representations (of moderate growth). A key ingredient of this definition is the functor of twisted coinvariants with respect to the nilradical of the mirabolic subgroup. In this paper we prove exactness of this functor and compute it on a certain class of representations. This implies exactness of the highest derivative functor, and allows to compute highest derivatives of all monomial representations. In [AGS] these results are applied to finish the computation of adduced representations for all irreducible unitary representations and to prove uniqueness of degenerate Whittaker models for unitary representations.

For two irreducible matrices A and B with entries in {0, 1} satisfying condition (I), it is proved that for a group isomorphism alpha from I" (A) to I" (B) , there exists a homeomorphism h from X (A) to X (B) such that alpha(gamma) = h au < gamma au < h (-1) for gamma a I" (A) and hence h au < I" (A) au < h (-1) = I" (B) . As a result, we know that the continuous full groups I" (A) and I" (B) are isomorphic as abstract groups if and only if their one-sided topological Markov shifts (X (A) , sigma (A) ) and (X (B) , sigma (B) ) are continuously orbit equivalent.

We investigate when it is absolutely continuous or singular with respect to Lebesgue measure. By ratio entropy over speed, we show that any countable non- abelian subgroup admits a finite first moment non- degenerate mu with singular harmonic measure v. On the other hand, we prove that some random walks with finitely supported step distribution admit a regular harmonic measure. Finally, we construct some exceptional random walks with arbitrarily small speed but singular harmonic measures. The two later results are obtained by comparison with Bernoulli convolutions, using results of Erdos and Solomyak.

J	Dinur, I; Guruswami, V				Dinur, Irit; Guruswami, Venkatesan			PCPs via the low-degree long code and hardness for constrained hypergraph coloring	ISRAEL JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICS			English	Article								We develop new techniques to incorporate the recently proposed "short code" (a low-degree version of the long code) into the construction and analysis of PCPs in the classical "label-cover + Fourier Analysis" framework. As a result, we obtain more size-efficient PCPs that yield improved hardness results for approximating CSPs and certain coloring-type problems. In particular, we show a hardness for a variant of hypergraph coloring (with hyperedges of size 6), with a gap between 2 and number of colors where N is the number of vertices. This is the first hardness result to go beyond the O(logN) barrier for a coloring-type problem. Our hardness bound is a doubly exponential improvement over the previously known O(log logN)-coloring hardness for 2-colorable hypergraphs, and an exponential improvement over the -coloring hardness for O(1)-colorable hypergraphs. Stated in terms of "covering complexity," we show that for 6-ary Boolean CSPs, it is hard to decide if a given instance is perfectly satisfiable or if it requires more than assignments for covering all of the constraints. While our methods do not yield a result for conventional hypergraph coloring due to some technical reasons, we also prove hardness of -coloring 2-colorable 8-uniform hypergraphs (this result relies just on the long code). A key algebraic result driving our analysis concerns a very low-soundness error testing method for Reed-Muller codes. We prove that if a function is far in absolute distance from polynomials of degree m - d, then the probability that deg(beta (g) ) a parts per thousand currency sign m - 3d/4 for a random degree d/4 polynomial g is doubly exponentially small in d.

Denote by J(f) its Julia set. Let phi: J(f) -> a"e be a Holder continuous function such that P(phi) > sup(phi). It is known that there exists a unique equilibrium measure for this potential. We introduce a special inducing scheme with fine recurrence properties. This construction allows us to prove four main results. Firstly, dimension rigidity, i.e., we characterize all maps and potentials for which . As its consequence we obtain that if and only if both the function phi: J(f) -> a"e is cohomologous to a constant in the class of continuous functions on J(f), and the rational function f: is a critically finite rational map with a parabolic orbifold. Secondly, real analyticity of topological pressure P(t phi) as a function of t. Third, some bold stochastic laws, namely, exponential decay of correlations, and, as its consequence, the Central Limit Theorem and the Law of Iterated Logarithm for Holder continuous observables. Also, the Law of Iterated Logarithm for all linear combinations of Holder continuous observables and the function log |f'|. Finally, its geometric consequences that allow us to compare equilibrium states with the appropriate generalized Hausdorff measures in the spirit of [PUZ].

J	Huang, LB				Huang, Libing			Ricci curvatures of left invariant Finsler metrics on Lie groups	ISRAEL JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICS			English	Article							SPACES	Left invariant Finsler metrics on Lie groups provide an important class of Finsler manifolds. In this paper, we prove several properties of the Ricci curvatures of such spaces. For example, if all the Ricci curvatures are nonnegative, then the underlying Lie group must be unimodular. If the Lie group is noncommutative and nilpotent, then there must be three directions whose Ricci curvature is positive, negative and zero, respectively. This result gives a negative answer to a question of S.-S. Chern.

We show that under certain assumptions on f, X and an invariant measure nu, the pressure of f can also be represented as the integral with respect to nu of the same integrand. Under stronger hypotheses we show that this representation holds for all invariant measures nu. We establish an algorithmic implication for approximation of pressure, and we relate our results to a result in thermodynamic formalism.

The aim of this paper is to investigate the properties of nu (n) 's. In particular, we obtain the cyclotomic integrality of nu (n) and a formula for nu (n) of the Drinfeld double. Our results are applied to the finite-dimensional pointed Hopf algebra u(D, lambda, A mu) introduced by Andruskiewitsch and Schneider. As an application, we obtain the second indicator of u (q) (sl(2)) and show that if p and q are roots of unity of the same order, then u (p) (sl(2)) and u (q) (sl(2)) are gauge equivalent if and only if q = p, where p and q are roots of unity of the same odd order.

In the archimedean case, an analog of the highest derivative was defined for irreducible unitary representations in [Sah89] and called the "adduced" representation. In this paper we define derivatives of all orders for smooth admissible Fr,chet representations of moderate growth. The real case is more problematic than the p-adic case; for example, arbitrary derivatives need not be admissible. However, the highest derivative continues being admissible, and for irreducible unitarizable representations coincides with the space of smooth vectors of the adduced representation. In the companion paper [AGS] we prove exactness of the highest derivative functor, and compute highest derivatives of all monomial representations. We apply those results to finish the computation of adduced representations for all irreducible unitary representations and to prove uniqueness of degenerate Whittaker models for unitary representations, thus completing the results of [Sah89, Sah90, SaSt90, GS13a].

A module-theoretic approach to abelian automorphism groups	ISRAEL JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICS			English	Article							FINITE P-GROUPS; ENDOMORPHIC IMAGES; NILPOTENT GROUPS; SUBGROUP; CLASS-2	There are several examples in the literature of finite non-abelian p-groups whose automorphism group is abelian. For some time only examples that were special p-groups were known, until Jain and Yadav [JY12] and Jain, Rai and Yadav [JRY13] constructed several non-special examples.

J	First, UA				First, Uriya A.			General bilinear forms	ISRAEL JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICS			English	Article							EQUIVALENCE; RINGS	We introduce the new notion of general bilinear forms (generalizing sesquilinear forms) and prove that for every ring R (not necessarily commutative, possibly without involution) and every right R-module M which is a generator (i.e., R (R) is a summand of M (n) for some n a a"center dot), there is a one-to-one correspondence between the anti-automorphisms of End(M) and the general regular bilinear forms on M, considered up to similarity. This generalizes a well-known similar correspondence in the case R is a field. We also demonstrate that there is no such correspondence for arbitrary R-modules. We use the generalized correspondence to show that there is a canonical set isomorphism Inn(R) \Aut(-)(R) a parts per thousand... Inn(M (n) (R))\Aut(-)(M (n) (R)), provided R (R) is the only right R-module N satisfying N (n) a parts per thousand...R (n) , and also to prove a variant of a theorem of Osborn. Namely, we classify all semisimple rings with involution admitting no non-trivial idempotents that are invariant under the involution.

Majority Dynamics and the Retention of Information	ISRAEL JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICS			English	Article							ZERO-TEMPERATURE; INFINITE-GRAPHS; SOCIAL NETWORKS; MONOPOLIES; SIZE	We consider a group of agents connected by a social network who participate in majority dynamics: each agent starts with an opinion in {-1, +1} and repeatedly updates it to match the opinion of the majority of its neighbors. We assume that one of {-1, +1} is the "correct" opinion S, and consider a setting in which the initial opinions are independent conditioned on S, and biased towards it. They hence contain enough information to reconstruct S with high probability. We ask whether it is still possible to reconstruct S from the agents' opinions after many rounds of updates. While this is not the case in general, we show that indeed, for a large family of bounded degree graphs, information on S is retained by the process of majority dynamics. Our proof technique yields novel combinatorial results on majority dynamics on both finite and infinite graphs, with applications to zero temperature Ising models.

The singular sets of these HCMU metrics consist of conical and cusp singularities, both of which are finitely many. We show that these metrics exist with the prescribed singularities if and only if so do certain meromorphic 1-forms on the Riemann surfaces, which only have simple poles with real residues and whose real parts are exact outside their poles.

Geometry and topology of random 2-complexes	ISRAEL JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICS			English	Article							HOMOLOGICAL CONNECTIVITY; SIMPLICIAL COMPLEXES; TOP HOMOLOGY; ASPHERICITY	We study random 2-dimensional complexes in the Linial-Meshulam model and prove that the fundamental group of a random 2-complex Y has cohomological dimension a parts per thousand currency sign 2 if the probability parameter satisfies p a parts per thousand(a) n (-3/5). Besides, for the fundamental group pi (1)(Y) has elements of order two and is of infinite cohomological dimension. We also prove that for the fundamental group of a random 2-complex has no m-torsion, for any given odd prime m a parts per thousand yen 3. We find a simple algorithmically testable criterion for a subcomplex of a random 2-complex to be aspherical; this implies that (for ) any aspherical subcomplex of a random 2-complex satisfies the Whitehead conjecture. We use inequalities for Cheeger constants and systoles of simplicial surfaces to analyse spheres and projective planes lying in random 2-complexes. Our proofs exploit the uniform hyperbolicity property of random 2-complexes (Theorem 3.4).	[Costa, A.

Such ordered abelian groups and fields are important because generalizations of Banach's Fixed Point Theorem hold in them. We prove that symmetrically complete ordered abelian groups and fields are divisible Hahn products and real closed power series fields, respectively. This gives us a direct route to the construction of symmetrically complete ordered abelian groups and fields, modulo an analogous construction at the level of ordered sets; in particular, this gives an alternative approach to the construction of symmetrically complete fields in [12].

Chas and Sullivan have defined (co)products on the homology of the free loop space H*(LM). F,lix and Thomas have extended the loop (co)products to those of simply-connected Gorenstein spaces over a field. We describe these loop (co)products in terms of the torsion and extension functors by developing string topology in appropriate derived categories. In Algebraic Topology, one of the most important tools for computing the (co)homology of the space of free loops on a space is the (co)homological Eilenberg-Moore spectral sequence. Consider, over any field, the homological Eilenberg-Moore spectral sequence converging to H (*)(LM). Our description of the loop product enables one to conclude that this spectral sequence is multiplicative with respect to the Chas-Sullivan loop product and that its E (2)-term is the Hochschild cohomology of H*(M). This gives a new method to compute the loop products on H (*)(LS (m) ) and H (*)(La",P (r) ), the free loop space homology of spheres and complex projective spaces.

We prove that this transform is smooth on an open dense set. We prove this result for the Archimedean and the non-Archimedean case in a uniform way. The Archimedean case was proved in [Ber1]. The non-Archimedean case was proved in [HK] and [CL1], [CL2]. Our method is different from those described in [Ber1], [HK], [CL1], [CL2]. It is based on Hironaka's desingularization theorem, unlike [Ber1] which is based on the theory of D-modules and [HK], [CL1], [CL2] which is based on model theory. Our method also gives bounds on the open dense set where the Fourier transform is smooth and, moreover, on the wave front set of the Fourier transform. These bounds are explicit in terms of resolution of singularities and field-independent. We also prove the same results on the Fourier transform of more general measures of algebraic origins.

On the structure of the degrees of relative provability	ISRAEL JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICS			English	Article								We investigate the structure of the degrees of provability, which measure the proof-theoretic strength of statements asserting the totality of given computable functions. The degrees of provability can also be seen as an extension of the investigation of relative consistency statements for first-order arithmetic (which can be viewed as I (1) (0) -statements, whereas statements of totality of computable functions are I (2) (0) -statements); and the structure of the degrees of provability can be viewed as the Lindenbaum algebra of true I (2) (0) -statements in first-order arithmetic. Our work continues and greatly expands the second author's paper on this topic by answering a number of open questions from that paper, comparing three different notions of a jump operator and studying jump inversion as well as the corresponding high/low hierarchies, investigating the structure of true I (1) (0) -statements as a substructure, and connecting the degrees of provability to escape and domination properties of computable functions.

J	Hamkins, JD; Leibman, G; Lowe, B				Hamkins, Joel David; Leibman, George; Lowe, Benedikt			Structural connections between a forcing class and its modal logic	ISRAEL JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICS			English	Article							MAXIMALITY PRINCIPLES	Every definable forcing class I" gives rise to a corresponding forcing modality where means that I center dot is true in all I" extensions, and the valid principles of I" forcing are the modal assertions that are valid for this forcing interpretation. For example, [10] shows that if ZFC is consistent, then the ZFC-provably valid principles of the class of all forcing are precisely the assertions of the modal theory S4.2. In this article, we prove similarly that the provably valid principles of collapse forcing, Cohen forcing and other classes are in each case exactly S4.3; the provably valid principles of c.c.c. forcing, proper forcing, and others are each contained within S4.3 and do not contain S4.2; the provably valid principles of countably closed forcing, CH-preserving forcing and others are each exactly S4.2; and the provably valid principles of omega (1)-preserving forcing are contained within S4.tBA. All these results arise from general structural connections we have identified between a forcing class and the modal logic of forcing to which it gives rise.

J	Rabier, PJ				Rabier, Patrick J.			Differentiability of quasiconvex functions on separable Banach spaces	ISRAEL JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICS			English	Article							CONE-MONOTONE FUNCTIONS; GAUSSIAN NULL SETS; CONTINUITY; MAPPINGS	We investigate the differentiability properties of a real-valued quasiconvex function f defined on a separable Banach space X. Continuity is only assumed to hold at the points of a dense subset. If so, this subset is automatically residual. Sample results that can be quoted without involving any new concept or nomenclature are as follows: (i) If f is usc or strictly quasiconvex, then f is Hadamard differentiable at the points of a dense subset of X. (ii) If f is even, then f is continuous and GA cent teaux differentiable at the points of a dense subset of X. In (i) or (ii), the dense subset need not be residual but, if X is also reflexive, it contains the complement of a Haar null set. Furthermore, (ii) remains true without the evenness requirement if the definition of GA cent teaux differentiability is generalized in an unusual, but ultimately natural, way. The full results are much more general and substantially stronger. In particular, they incorporate the well known theorem of Crouzeix, to the effect that every real-valued quasiconvex function on a"e (N) is Fr,chet differentiable a.e.

Our arguments are based on a weighted version of the Furstenberg correspondence principle, relative to a weight which obeys an infinite number of pseudorandomness (or "linear forms") conditions, combined with the main results of a series of papers by Green and the authors which establish such an infinite number of pseudorandomness conditions for a weight associated with the primes. The same result, by a rather different method, has been simultaneously established by Cook, Magyar and Titichetrakun and more recently by Fox and Zhao.

The algorithm that we study depends on two parameters a and b. We first find a Markov partition if a a parts per thousand yen b.

Counting invariant components of hyperelliptic translation surfaces	ISRAEL JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICS			English	Article							NUMBER	The flow in a fixed direction on a translation surface S determines a decomposition of S into closed invariant sets, each of which is either periodic or minimal. We study this decomposition for translation surfaces in the hyperelliptic connected components H (hyp) (2g - 2) and H (hyp) (g - 1, g - 1) of the corresponding strata of the moduli space of translation surfaces. Specifically, we characterize the pairs of nonnegative integers (p,m) for which there exists a translation surface in H (hyp) (2g-2) or H (hyp) (g-1, g-1) with precisely p periodic components and m minimal components. This extends results by Naveh ([Nav08]), who obtained tight upper bounds on numbers of invariant components for each stratum.

J	Pazzis, CD				Pazzis, Clement De Seguins			THE CLASSIFICATION OF LARGE SPACES OF MATRICES WITH BOUNDED RANK	ISRAEL JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICS			English	Article							PRESERVERS	Given an arbitrary (commutative) field K, let V be a linear subspace of Mn(K) consisting of matrices of rank less than or equal to some r epsilon[[1, n-1]]. A theorem of Atkinson and Lloyd states that, if dim V > nr-r + 1 and # K > r, then either all the matrices of V vanish everywhere on some common (n -r)-dimensional subspace of K-n, or it is true of the matrices of the transposed space V-T. Using a new approach, we prove that the restriction on the cardinality of the underlying field is unnecessary. We also show that the results of Atkinson and Lloyd in the case dimV = nr-r+ 1 hold for any field, except in the special case when n = 3, r = 2 and K similar or equal to F-2. In that exceptional situation, we classify all the exceptional spaces up to equivalence. Similar theorems of Beasley for rectangular matrices are also extended to all fields. Finally, we extend Atkinson, Lloyd and Beasley's classification theorems to a range of high dimensions which almost doubles theirs, under the assumption that # K > r.

Part II: The lower bound	ISRAEL JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICS			English	Article							GAMMA-CONVERGENCE; PHASE-TRANSITIONS	We construct the lower bound, in the spirit of I"-convergence for some general classes of singular perturbation problems, with or without a prescribed differential constraint, of the form where the function F is nonnegative and A: a"e (kxN) -> a"e (m) is a prescribed linear operator (for example, A:a parts per thousand 0, A center dot a-v:= curl v and A center dot a-v = divv). Furthermore, we study the cases where we can easily prove that this lower bound coincides with the upper bound obtained in [18]. In particular, we find the formula for the I"-limit for a general class of anisotropic problems without a differential constraint (i.e., in the case A:a parts per thousand 0).

J	Richter, B				Richter, Birgit			On the homology and homotopy of commutative shuffle algebras	ISRAEL JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICS			English	Article							SPECTRA	For commutative algebras there are three important homology theories, Harrison homology, Andr,-Quillen homology and Gamma-homology. In general these differ, unless one works with respect to a ground field of characteristic zero. We show that the analogues of these homology theories agree in the category of pointed commutative monoids in symmetric sequences and that Hochschild homology always possesses a Hodge decomposition in this setting. In addition we prove that the category of pointed differential graded commutative monoids in symmetric sequences has a model structure and that it is Quillen equivalent to the model category of pointed simplicial commutative monoids in symmetric sequences.

THE ABSOLUTE CONTINUOUS SPECTRUM OF SKEW PRODUCTS OF COMPACT LIE GROUPS	ISRAEL JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICS			English	Article							CONTINUOUS COCYCLES; VALUES	Let X and G be compact Lie groups, F1 : X. X the time-one map of a C-infinity measure-preserving flow, phi : X -> G a continuous function and p a finite-dimensional irreducible unitary representation of G. Then, we prove that the skew products T phi : X x G -> X x G, (x,g) -> (F-1 (x),g phi(x)), have purely absolutely continuous spectrum in the subspace associated to pi if pi o phi f has a Dini- continuous Lie derivative along the flow and if a matrix multiplication operator related to the topological degree of pi o phi has nonzero determinant. This result provides a simple, but general, criterion for the presence of an absolutely continuous component in the spectrum of skew products of compact Lie groups. As an illustration, we consider the cases where F1 is an ergodic translation on T-d and X x G = T-d xT(d) (=) X x G = T-d x SU(2) and X x G = T-d x U(2). Our proofs rely on recent results on positive commutator methods for unitary operators.

J	Yadav, MK				Yadav, Manoj K.			Class-preserving automorphisms of finite p-groups II	ISRAEL JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICS			English	Article							FROBENIUS	Let G be a finite group minimally generated by d(G) elements and Aut (c) (G) denote the group of all (conjugacy) class-preserving automorphisms of G. Continuing our work [Class preserving automorphisms of finite p-groups, J. London Math. Soc. 75 (2007), 755-772], we study finite p-groups G such that |Aut (c) (G)| = |gamma 2(G)| (d(G)), where gamma 2(G) denotes the commutator subgroup of G. If G is such a p-group of class 2, then we show that d(G) is even, 2d(gamma 2(G)) a parts per thousand currency sign d(G) and G/ Z(G) is homocyclic. When the nilpotency class of G is larger than 2, we obtain the following (surprising) results: (i) d(G) = 2. (ii) If |gamma 2(G)/gamma (3)(G)| > 2, then |Aut (c) (G)| = |gamma 2(G)| (d(G)) if and only if G is a 2-generator group with cyclic commutator subgroup, where gamma (3)(G) denotes the third term in the lower central series of G. (iii) If |gamma 2(G)/gamma (3)(G)| = 2, then |Aut (c) (G)| = |gamma 2(G)| (d(G)) if and only if G is a 2-generator 2-group of nilpotency class 3 with elementary abelian commutator subgroup of order at most 8. As an application, we classify finite nilpotent groups G such that the central quotient G/ Z(G) of G by its center Z(G) is of the largest possible order. For proving these results, we introduce a generalization of Camina groups and obtain some interesting results. We use Lie theoretic techniques and computer algebra system 'Magma' as tools.

J	Araujo, J; Bentz, W; Konieczny, J				Araujo, Joao; Bentz, Wolfram; Konieczny, Janusz			The commuting graph of the symmetric inverse semigroup	ISRAEL JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICS			English	Article							TRANSFORMATIONS; SUBSEMIGROUPS; CENTRALIZERS; IDEMPOTENTS; QUOTIENTS	The commuting graph of a finite non-commutative semigroup S, denoted G(S), is a simple graph whose vertices are the non-central elements of S and two distinct vertices x, y are adjacent if xy = yx. Let I(X) be the symmetric inverse semigroup of partial injective transformations on a finite set X. The semigroup I(X) has the symmetric group Sym(X) of permutations on X as its group of units. In 1989, Burns and Goldsmith determined the clique number of the commuting graph of Sym(X). In 2008, Iranmanesh and Jafarzadeh found an upper bound of the diameter of G(Sym(X)), and in 2011, Dolzan and Oblak claimed that this upper bound is in fact the exact value. The goal of this paper is to begin the study of the commuting graph of the symmetric inverse semigroup I(X). We calculate the clique number of G(I(X)), the diameters of the commuting graphs of the proper ideals of I(X), and the diameter of G(I(X)) when |X| is even or a power of an odd prime. We show that when |X| is odd and divisible by at least two primes, then the diameter of G(I(X)) is either 4 or 5. In the process, we obtain several results about semigroups, such as a description of all commutative subsemigroups of I(X) of maximum order, and analogous results for commutative inverse and commutative nilpotent subsemigroups of I(X). The paper closes with a number of problems for experts in combinatorics and in group or semigroup theory.

J	Skryabin, S				Skryabin, Serge			Invariant subrings and Jacobson radicals of Noetherian Hopf module algebras	ISRAEL JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICS			English	Article							SEMIPRIME SMASH PRODUCTS; GROUP-GRADED RINGS; GALOIS EXTENSIONS; IDEALS	In this paper several classical facts known for group actions and group gradings on rings are extended to the case of a Noetherian H-module algebra A for a Hopf algebra H. When H is semisimple, a version of the Bergman-Isaacs result is proved, asserting the nilpotency of any onesided ideal of A whose intersection with the subalgebra of H-invariant elements A (H) is nilpotent. Under the additional assumption that A is H-semiprime, it is established that the classical quotient ring Q(A) of A is the Ore localization of A at the set of H-invariant regular elements. When H is finite-dimensional cosemisimple, the Jacobson radical of A is shown to be stable under the action of H. More generally, these results are obtained for algebras over an arbitrary commutative base ring under suitable restrictions on the Hopf algebra and its action.

J	Avitabile, M; Mattarei, S				Avitabile, Marina; Mattarei, Sandro			Laguerre polynomials of derivations	ISRAEL JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICS			English	Article							LIE P-ALGEBRAS; INFINITE TYPE; DIAMONDS; FINITE	We introduce a grading switching for arbitrary non-associative algebras of prime characteristic p, aimed at producing a new grading of an algebra from a given one. We take inspiration from a fundamental tool in the classification theory of modular Lie algebras known as toral switching, which relies on a delicate adaptation of the exponential of a derivation. Our grading switching is achieved by evaluating certain generalized Laguerre polynomials of degree p - 1, which play the role of generalized exponentials, on a derivation of the algebra. A crucial part of our argument is establishing a congruence for them which is an appropriate analogue of the functional equation e (x) center dot e (y) = e (x+y) for the classical exponential. Besides having a wider scope, our treatment provides a more transparent explanation of some aspects of the original toral switching, which can be recovered as a special case.

There are various quantitative generalizations of this statement, showing that for functions that are in some sense close to having a zero of multiplicity greater than k, the first k derivatives must be small. In this paper we aim to generalize this situation to the multi-dimensional setting. We define a class of differential operators, the multiplicity operators, which act on maps from a", (n) to a", (n) and satisfy properties analogous to those described above. We demonstrate the usefulness of the construction by applying it to some problems in the theory of Noetherian functions.

It is the simplest category satisfying our conventions and modelling the notions of finiteness, countability and infinite equi-cardinality. We argue that from the homotopy theoretic point of view our construction is essentially automatic following basic existing methods, and so is (almost all) the verification that the construction works. We use the posetal model category to introduce homotopy-theoretic intuitions to set theory. Our main observation is that the homotopy invariant version of cardinality is the covering number of Shelah's PCF theory, and that other combinatorial objects, such as Shelah's revised power function-the cardinal function featuring in Shelah's revised GCH theorem-can be obtained using similar tools. We include a small "dictionary" for set theory in QtNaamen, hoping it will help in finding more meaningful homotopy-theoretic intuitions in set theory.

The same holds for the Urysohn sphere S. Let M be a Fraisse L-structure, where L is a relational countable language and M has no algebraicity. We provide necessary and sufficient conditions for the following to hold: "For a generic substructure A of M, every automorphism f epsilon Aut(A) extends to a full automorphism (f) over tilde Aut(M)."From our analysis, a dichotomy arises and some structural results are derived that in particular apply to omega-stable Fraisse structures without algebraicity.

In addition we prove that a densely 1-based type of D-rank 1 is 1-based. We also observe that for a hypersimple unidimensional theory the existence of a non-algebraic stable type implies stability (and thus superstability).

J	Morris, ID				Morris, Ian D.			A note on configurations in sets of positive density which occur at all large scales	ISRAEL JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICS			English	Article							ERGODIC THEOREMS; DISTANCES; SZEMEREDI	Furstenberg, Katznelson and Weiss proved in the early 1980s that every measurable subset of the plane with positive density at infinity has the property that all sufficiently large real numbers are realised as the Euclidean distance between points in that set. Their proof used ergodic theory to study translations on a space of Lipschitz functions corresponding to closed subsets of the plane, combined with a measure-theoretical argument. We consider an alternative dynamical approach in which the phase space is given by the set of measurable functions from a"e (d) to [0, 1], which we view as a compact subspace of L (a)(a"e (d) ) in the weak-* topology. The pointwise ergodic theorem for a"e (d) -actions implies that with respect to any translation-invariant measure on this space, almost every function is asymptotically close to a constant function at large scales. This observation leads to a general sufficient condition for a configuration to occur in every set of positive upper Banach density at all sufficiently large scales. To illustrate the use of this criterion we apply it to prove a new result concerning three-point configurations in measurable subsets of the plane which form the vertices of a triangle with specified area and side length, yielding a new proof of a result related to work of R.

Furthermore, when R is a domain, the same conclusion holds without the assumption that R is finitely generated. This enables us to obtain a result on skew polynomial rings.

Given an algebraic variety X (not necessarily equidimensional) in characteristic zero (or, more generally, a pair (X, D), where D is a divisor on X), we construct a functorial desingularization of all but stable simple normal crossings (stable-snc) singularities, by smooth blowings-up that preserve such singularities. A variety has stable simple normal crossings at a point if, locally, its irreducible components are smooth and transverse in some smooth embedding variety. We also show that our main assertion is false for more general simple normal crossings singularities.

The author proved that A (-1) can only be contained in A if either A is a subfield, or A is the set of trace zero elements in a quadratic extension of a field.

He also gave examples showing that his bound is sharp for |B| a parts per thousand currency sign q (3). Our main result is a proof of the stronger bound |A (-1) a (c) B| a parts per thousand currency sign |B|/q center dot (1 + O (d) (q (-1/2))), for |B| = q (d) with d > 3.

This measured category vanishes easily for interesting dynamics. When it is zero, by taking arbitrarily large homotopies, the rate of convergence to zero of the quantity involved in the definition gives a new invariant, called the secondary measured category. Several versions of classical results are proved for the secondary measured category. It is also shown that the secondary measured category is a transverse invariant and it has a deep relation with the growth of pseudogroups.
