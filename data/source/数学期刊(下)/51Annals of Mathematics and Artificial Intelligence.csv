QSAR is in widespread use within the pharmaceutical industry to prioritize compounds for experimental testing or to alert for potential toxicity during the drug discovery process. However, the confidence or reliability of predictions from a QSAR model are difficult to accurately assess. We frame the application of QSAR to preclinical drug development in an off-line inductive conformal prediction framework and apply it prospectively to historical data collected from four different assays within AstraZeneca over a time course of about five years. The results indicate weakened validity of the conformal predictor due to violations of the randomness assumption. The validity can be strengthen by adopting semi-off-line conformal prediction. The non-randomness of the data prevents exactly valid predictions but comparisons to the results of a traditional QSAR procedure applied to the same data indicate that conformal predictions are highly useful in the drug discovery process.

We present new coordinate systems by extending the symmetric coordinate systems that are appropriate to address elements (cells) of cell complexes. Coordinate triplets are used to address the hexagon/triangle pixels, their sides (the edges between the border of neighbour pixels) and the points at the corners of the hexagon/triangle pixels. Properties of the coordinate systems are detailed, lines (zig-zag lines) and lanes (hexagonal stepping lanes) are defined on the triangular (resp. hexagonal) grid by fixing a coordinate value. The bounding relation of the cells can easily be captured by the coordinate values. To illustrate the utility of these coordinate systems some topological algorithms, namely collapses and cuts are presented.

J	Vovk, V				Vovk, Vladimir			Cross-conformal predictors	ANNALS OF MATHEMATICS AND ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						Conformal predictors; Cross-validation; Inductive conformal predictors; Tolerance regions		Inductive conformal predictors have been designed to overcome the computational inefficiency exhibited by conformal predictors for many underlying prediction algorithms. Whereas computationally efficient, inductive conformal predictors sacrifice different parts of the training set at different stages of prediction, which affects their informational efficiency. This paper introduces the method of cross-conformal prediction, which is a hybrid of the methods of inductive conformal prediction and cross-validation, and studies its validity and informational efficiency empirically. The computational efficiency of cross-conformal predictors is comparable to that of inductive conformal predictors, and they produce valid predictions in our empirical studies.

This contour uses local and global information along with Gaussian distribution. The present paper derives the main LGFGD equation and investigates its parameters sigma, lambda and m. Specific values are determined (for sigma, lambda, m) to ensure high accuracy of segmentation of medical images containing nonhomogeneous and noisy regions with week boundaries. To validate the model, a new set of experiments was performed with new images including 24 skin lesion images with ground truth. Thus, a statistic of the LGFGD performance was calculated regarding the model's interval of confidence. Comparison with contemporary methods from the field is provided as well.

The topology of the square grid is well-understood, but it cannot be said of the remaining two regular sampling schemes. This work deals with the topological properties of digital binary pictures sampled on the triangular grid. Some characterizations of simple pixels and sufficient conditions for topology preserving operators are reported. These results provide the theoretical background to various topological algorithms including thinning, shrinking, generating discrete Voronoi diagrams, and contour smoothing on the triangular grid.

The approach makes use of techniques of Hough transform to recognize geometric objects and their labels and of numeric verification to mine basic geometric relations. Candidate propositions are generated from the retrieved information by using six strategies and geometric theorems are obtained from the candidates via algebraic computation. Experiments with a preliminary implementation illustrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed approach for generating nontrivial theorems from images of diagrams. This work demonstrates the feasibility of automated discovery of profound geometric knowledge from simple image data and has potential applications in geometric knowledge management and education.

If the target user machine has hardware limitations, or if the computer algebra system cannot be easily (or legally) packaged inside the geometric software, this approach can solve current shortcomings in dynamic environments.We report the design and implementation of a web service using Singular, a program specialized in ideal theory and commutative algebra. Besides its canonical address, a virtual appliance and a port to a low-cost ARM based computer are also provided. Any interactive geometric environment can then outsource computations where Singular is used, and incorporate their results into the system. In particular, we illustrate the capabilities of the web service by extending current abilities of GeoGebra to deal with algebraic loci and envelopes by means of a recent algorithm for studying parametric polynomial systems.

The theory of integrity constraints is largely a theory over relations. To make data processing more efficient, SQL permits database states to be partial bags that can accommodate incomplete and duplicate information. Integrity constraints, however, interact differently on partial bags than on the idealized special case of relations. In this current paper, we study the implication problem of the combined class of general cardinality constraints and not-null constraints on partial bags. We investigate structural properties of Armstrong tables for general cardinality constraints and not-null constraints, and prove exact conditions for their existence. For the fragment of general max-cardinality constraints, unary min-cardinality constraints and not-null constraints we show that the effort for constructing Armstrong tables is precisely exponential. For the same fragment we provide an axiomatic characterization of the implication problem. The major tool for establishing our results is the Hajnal and Szemer,di theorem on the equitable colorings of graphs.

In this paper we present our framework for the formalization of mathematical knowledge that can produce machine verifiable proofs (for different proof assistants) but also human-readable (nearly textbook-like) proofs. As a case study, we focus on one of the twentieth century classics - a book on Tarski's geometry. We tried to automatically generate such proofs for the theorems from this book using resolution theorem provers and a coherent logic theorem prover. In the first experiment, we used only theorems from the book, in the second we used additional lemmas from the existing Coq formalization of the book, and in the third we used specific dependency lists from the Coq formalization for each theorem. The results show that 37 % of the theorems from the book can be automatically proven (with readable and machine verifiable proofs generated) without any guidance, and with additional lemmas this percentage rises to 42 %. These results give hope that the described framework and other forms of automation can significantly aid mathematicians in developing formal and informal mathematical knowledge.

These tools can be used to detect outliers and clusters. Both our prediction bands and clustering trees provide prediction sets for the underlying stochastic process with a guaranteed finite sample behavior, under no distributional assumptions. The prediction sets are also informative in that they correspond to the high density region of the underlying process. While ordinary conformal prediction has high computational cost for functional data, we use the inductive conformal predictor, together with several novel choices of conformity scores, to simplify the computation. Our methods are illustrated on some real data examples.

The experiments showed that probability intervals are narrow, that is, the output of the multiprobability predictor is similar to a single probability distribution. In addition, probability intervals produced for heart disease and ovarian cancer data were more accurate than the output of corresponding probability predictor. When Venn machines were forced to make point predictions, the accuracy of such predictions is for the most data better than the accuracy of the underlying algorithm that outputs single probability distribution of a label. Application of this methodology to MALDI-TOF data sets empirically demonstrates the validity. The accuracy of the proposed method on ovarian cancer data rises from 66.7 % 11 months in advance of the moment of diagnosis to up to 90.2 % at the moment of diagnosis. The same approach has been applied to heart disease data without time dependency, although the achieved accuracy was not as high (up to 69.9 %). The methodology allowed us to confirm mass spectrometry peaks previously identified as carrying statistically significant information for discrimination between controls and cases.

In such a context, they are generally considered as continuous processes, followed by a digitization of the results. Recently, rigid transformations on a"currency sign (2) have been alternatively formulated as a fully discrete process. Following this paradigm, we investigate - from a combinatorial point of view - the effects of pixel-invariance constraints on such transformations. In particular we describe the impact of these constraints on both the combinatorial structure of the transformation space and the algorithm leading to its generation.

The present paper introduces an improved metric in the 4D manifold first and then extends both the size of the sample space and the dimension (to 6D) of the manifold model in which the sample space lies. As a result, we not only overcame the issue of one single vector representing multiple skin lesions, which occurred in the work of Mete, Ou, and Sirakov (2012), but also improved the accuracy of classification. Furthermore, a statistical evaluation of our support vector machine (SVM) classification method was performed. The intervals of confidence were calculated for the mean of classification of a large sample set in the 6D model. Comparison results of classification with our SVM in 4D and 6D models using 10-fold cross-validation are given at the end of the paper. It is found that the 6D model improves the classification results of the previous study suggesting that two newly introduced features contributed to the increase of the classification accuracy.

J	Laxhammar, R; Falkman, G				Laxhammar, Rikard; Falkman, Goran			Inductive conformal anomaly detection for sequential detection of anomalous sub-trajectories	ANNALS OF MATHEMATICS AND ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						Conformal prediction; Anomaly detection; Trajectory data; Local outlier factor; Maritime surveillance	OUTLIER DETECTION; PREDICTION	Detection of anomalous trajectories is an important problem for which many algorithms based on learning of normal trajectory patterns have been proposed. Yet, these algorithms are typically designed for offline anomaly detection in databases and are insensitive to local sub-trajectory anomalies. Generally, previous anomaly detection algorithms often require tuning of many parameters, including ad-hoc anomaly thresholds, which may result in overfitting and high alarm rates. The main contributions of this paper are two-fold: The first is the proposal and analysis of the Inductive Conformal Anomaly Detector (ICAD), which is a general and parameter-light anomaly detection algorithm that has well-calibrated alarm rate. ICAD is a generalisation of the previously proposed Conformal Anomaly Detector (CAD) based on the concept of Inductive Conformal Predictors. The main advantage of ICAD compared to CAD is the improved computational efficiency. The only design parameter of ICAD is the Non-Conformity Measure (NCM). The second contribution of this paper concerns the proposal and investigation of the Sub-Sequence Local Outlier (SSLO) NCM, which is designed for sequential detection of anomalous sub-trajectories in the framework of ICAD. SSLO-NCM is based on Local Outlier Factor (LOF) and is therefore sensitive to local sub-trajectory anomalies. The results from the empirical investigations on an unlabelled set of vessel trajectories illustrate the most anomalous trajectories detected for different parameter values of SSLO-NCM, and confirm that the empirical alarm rate is indeed well-calibrated.

A unifying learning framework for building artificial game-playing agents	ANNALS OF MATHEMATICS AND ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						Behavioral game theory; Graphical model; Multi-agent learning; Fictitious play; Hidden Markov model	EXPERIENCE; EQUILIBRIA; CONSTANT; SYSTEMS; MODELS	This paper investigates learning-based agents that are capable of mimicking human behavior in game playing, a central task in computational economics. Although computational economists have developed various game-playing agents, well-established machine learning methods such as graphical models have not been applied before. Leveraging probabilistic graphical models, this paper presents a novel sequential Bayesian network (SBN) framework for building artificial game-playing agents. We show that many existing agents, including reinforcement learning, fictitious play, and many of their variants, have a unified Bayesian explanation within the proposed SBN framework. Moreover, we discover that SBN can handle various important settings of game playing, allowing for a broad scope of its use in economics. SBN not only provides a unifying and satisfying framework to explain existing learning approaches in virtual economies, but also enables the development of new algorithms that are stronger or have fewer restrictions. In this paper, we derive a new algorithm, Hidden Markovian Play (HMP), from the generic SBN model to handle an important but difficult setting in which a player cannot observe the opponent's strategy and payoff. It leverages Markovian learning to infer unobservable information, leading to higher quality of the agents. Experiments on real-world field experiments in evaluating economies show that our HMP model outperforms the baseline algorithms for building artificial agents.

In this paper, we investigate the relational probabilistic conditional logic FO-PCL whose semantics employs the principle of maximum entropy. While in general, this semantics is defined via the ground instances of the rules in an FO-PCL knowledge base , the maximum entropy model can be computed on the level of rules rather than on the level of instances of the rules if is parametrically uniform. We elaborate in detail the reasons that cause to be not parametrically uniform. Based on this investigation, we derive a new syntactic criterion for parametric uniformity and develop an algorithm that transforms any FO-PCL knowledge base into an equivalent knowledge base that is parametrically uniform. This provides a basis for a simplified maximum entropy model computation since for this computation, can be used instead of R.

Our basic language has only the operators union and composition, together with the identity relation. Richer languages can be obtained by adding other features such as intersection, difference, projection and coprojection, converse, and the diversity relation. The expressive power of the languages thus obtained cannot only be evaluated at the level of path queries (queries returning binary relations), but also at the level of Boolean or yes/no queries (expressed by the nonemptiness of an expression). For the languages considered above, adding transitive closure augments the expressive power not only at the level of path queries but also at the level of Boolean queries, for the latter provided that multiple input relations are allowed. This is no longer true in the context of unlabeled graphs (i.e., in the case where there is only one input relation), however. In this paper, we prove that this is indeed not the case for the basic language to which none, one, or both of projection and the diversity relation are added, a surprising result given the limited expressive power of these languages. In combination with earlier work (Fletcher et al. 2011, 2012), this result yields a complete understanding of the impact of transitive closure on the languages under consideration.

Our study starts by defining a PSAT normal form, on which all algorithms are based. The proposed algorithms consist of several forms of reductions of PSAT to classical propositional satisfiability (SAT). The first algorithm is a canonical reduction of PSAT instances to SAT instances; three other algorithms are reductions to linear optimization with distinct column generation procedures, namely on auxiliary calls to SAT, weighted MAXSAT or SMT solvers. Theoretical and practical limitations of each algorithm are discussed. Several implementations were developed and compared by means of experiments using randomly generated input problems. Some of the implementations are shown to present a phase transition behavior. We show that variations of these algorithms may lead to the partial occlusion of the phase transition phenomenon and discuss the reasons for this change ofc practical behavior.

Since obtaining this viability theory output is a complex and computationally intensive task, we propose in this article to consider a compact representation of this set and its approximations using kd-trees. Given a subset of R-n of non null measure, defined through a black box function (an oracle), and assuming some regularity properties on this set, we build a kd-tree based data structure representing this set, which can be used as an input to the viability algorithm. This data structure has a complexity close to gaining one dimension, both in terms of space and in number of calls to the oracle, compared to the exhaustive computation on a regular grid. This data structure produces a characteristic function (i.e. a function that can be used in lieu of the oracle), allows to measure the volume of the set, and to compute the distance to the boundary of the set for any point. It offers distance guarantee between the points of the original set and its kd-tree approximation.

This paper deals with the problem of fitting a discrete polynomial curve to given 2D integer points in the presence of outliers. A 2D discrete polynomial curve is defined as a set of integer points lying between two polynomial curves. We formulate the problem as a discrete optimization problem in which the number of points included in the discrete polynomial curve, i.e., the number of inliers, is maximized. We then propose a robust method that effectively achieves a solution guaranteeing local maximality by using a local search, called rock climbing, with a seed obtained by RANSAC. We also extend our method to deal with a 3D discrete polynomial surface. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method.

While existing theories such as the Dempster-Shafer theory and the possibility theory have been used for several years now, they do not provide guarantees of error calibration in information fusion settings. The Conformal Predictions (CP) framework is a new game-theoretic approach to reliable machine learning, which provides a methodology to obtain error calibration under classification and regression settings. In this work, we present a methodology to extend the Conformal Predictions framework to both classification and regression-based information fusion settings. This methodology is based on applying the CP framework to each data source as an independent hypothesis test, and subsequently using p-value combination methods as a test statistic for the combined hypothesis after fusion. The proposed methodology was studied in classification and regression settings within two real-world application contexts: person recognition using multiple modalities (classification), and head pose estimation using multiple image features (regression). Our experimental results showed that quantile methods of combining p-values (such as the Standard Normal Function and the Non-conformity Aggregation methods) provided the most statistically valid calibration results, and can be considered to extend the CP framework for information fusion settings.

An important drawback of Venn Predictors is their computational inefficiency, especially in the case of large datasets. In this work, we investigate and propose Inductive Venn Predictors (IVPs), which can overcome the computational inefficiency problem of the original Transductive Venn Prediction framework. We develop an IVP algorithm and perform a detailed comparison of its time efficiency, accuracy, and quality of probabilistic outputs with those of the original Transductive Venn Predictor (TVP). The results demonstrate that our method provides well calibrated results while maintaining high accuracy. The IVP outperforms the original TVP method in terms of time efficiency, while also providing well-calibrated probabilistic estimates. Another observation is that the probability intervals of the IVP are tighter than those of the TVP.

J	Biskup, J; Tadros, C				Biskup, Joachim; Tadros, Cornelia			Preserving confidentiality while reacting on iterated queries and belief revisions	ANNALS OF MATHEMATICS AND ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						Axiomatization; Belief revision; Confidential belief; Confidentiality preservation; Inference control; Meta-inferences; Multiagent system; Nonmonotonic reasoning; Query answering; Skeptical entailment	MANAGEMENT; DATABASES; LOGICS; AGENTS	In multiagent systems, agents interact and in particular exchange information to achieve a joint goal, e.g., arrange a meeting, negotiate a sales contract etc. An agent, as a rational reasoner, is able to incorporate new information into her belief about her environment (belief revision) or to share her belief with other agents (query answering). Our agent model is based on a common line of research where belief revision is seen as the process of nonmonotonic reasoning from the available information. Yet, such an agent might be interested to hide confidential parts of her belief from another requesting agent and, thus, must control the respective reaction to a revision or query request. As our first contribution, we define the confidentiality aims of the reacting agent and postulate the requesting agent's capabilities in attacking these interests. In particular, we study an operator by means of which the requesting agent attempts to skeptically entail confidential beliefs of the reacting agent from observed reactions. This skeptical entailment operator is based on a class of nonmonotonic consequence relations such that the reacting agent's reasoning is implemented as an instance of this class. As our second contribution, we give an algorithmic solution for the reacting agent to enforce her confidentiality aims. To this end, we show how skeptical entailment could be computed via deduction with respect to an appropriate axiomatization of the class of consequence relations on which skeptical entailment is based. In particular, we present control procedures using the skeptical entailment operator and prove that these procedures effectively enforce confidentiality by means of refusal even if the requesting agent also takes their execution into consideration (meta-inference).

In this article, we prove the computational complexity of a class of fibring logics. Especially for a fibring logic composed of two S5 systems, we present a novel reduction method, Fibring Structure Mapping, to settle its complexity. Then, we found a special NP -complete fragment for the fibred S5 system. The significance of these results is that, on the one hand, the reduction method presented in this article can be generalized to settle the computational complexity problem of other fibring logics, and on the other hand, they help us to achieve a balance between the expressive power and the difficulty of computation.

On finding a shortest isothetic path and its monotonicity inside a digital object	ANNALS OF MATHEMATICS AND ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						Shortest path; Shortest isothetic path; Manhattan path; Monotone path; Shape analysis; Digital geometry; Monotonicity number	APPROXIMATION ALGORITHMS; ROUTE	Algorithms for finding shortest paths and their numerous variants have been studied extensively over several decades in graph theory, computational geometry, and in operations research. Still, design of such algorithms poses newer challenges in various emerging areas of image analysis and computer vision. This mandates further investigation of application-specific shortest-path problems in the framework of digital geometry. We present here an efficient combinatorial algorithm for finding a shortest isothetic path (SIP) between two grid points in a digital object without any hole, such that the SIP lies entirely inside the object. Our algorithm first determines a maximum-area isothetic polygon that is inscribed within the object. Certain combinatorial rules are then used to construct the SIP on the basis of its constituent monotone sub-paths, the number of which is invariant regardless of the choice of SIP between two given grid points. For a given grid size, the proposed algorithm runs in time, where n is the number of grid points appearing on the boundary of the inscribed polygon. Experimental results show the effectiveness of the algorithm and its further prospects in shape analysis.

In contrast to many existing systems, we are interested in making soft decision rather than a purely binary classification for the signatures under verification. To accomplish this goal, we incorporate both types of features: finer intensity-based features and global geometry-based features. Particularly, the finer features are computed for every sample point of a signature using histogram of intensities, and the geometry-based features are extracted using an adaptation of the shape context descriptor. One of the advantages of our approach is that the extracted features are very robust to noise, rotation and scaling change without heavily relying on any complicated pre-processing steps. The extracted features are used to compute the similarity score, followed by a score calibration process to estimate the corresponding confidence score (i.e., using log-likelihood-ratio). To validate our work, we submitted our system to the signature verification competition (SignComp2011) and achieved quite good results.

J	Szabo, GI; Benczur, A				Szabo, Gyula I.; Benczur, Andras			Functional dependencies on extended relations defined by regular languages	ANNALS OF MATHEMATICS AND ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						Functional dependency; Regular language; XML	XML SCHEMA; KEYS; DERIVATIVES; EXPRESSIONS; CONSTRAINTS; AUTOMATA	Functional dependency (FD) is one of the most analyzed integrity constraints for any data model. In the relational data model, FDs are defined in a natural way: the values of an attribute set Y depend on the values of another attribute set X, that is, "Y is a function of X". FDs are well studied and are widely used in normalization theory. XML functional dependencies (XFD) can be defined in different ways and no universally best definition has been proposed. They are defined by very intricate concepts, and they are mostly based upon XML elements described by XML schema languages such as a DTD or an XML Schema definition. The instances of these elements are semi-structured tuples. A semi-structured tuple is an ordered list of (attribute: value) pairs. We may think of a tuple as a sentence of a formal language, where the values are the terminal symbols and the attribute names are the nonterminal symbols. In this way, the sequence of the attribute names is the left side of a production rule used to accept the next terminal symbol, that is, the next value of the tuple. So the list of values forms the sentence and the list of attributes forms the dual sentence. In this paper, we introduce the notion of the extended tuple as a sentence from a regular language generated by a grammar where the nonterminal symbols of the grammar are the attribute names of the tuple. Sets of extended tuples are the extended relations (relations are instances). We then introduce the dual language, which generates the tuple types allowed to occur in extended relations. We define functional dependencies over extended relations. The syntax of functional dependencies will be given on the graph of the finite state automaton accepting the regular language. Using this model, we can also handle extended relations generated by recursive regular expressions. The implication problem of our class of dependencies is decidable and finitely axiomatizable by a version of the Chase algorithm performed on the graph of the associated finite state automaton.

J	Shin, K				Shin, Kilho			A theory of subtree matching and tree kernels based on the edit distance concept	ANNALS OF MATHEMATICS AND ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						Trees; Positive definite kernels; Edit distance	ORDERED LABELED TREES; CLASSIFICATION; ALGORITHMS; ALIGNMENT; XML	Edit distances provide us with an established method to capture structural features of data, and a distance between data objects represents their dissimilarity. In contrast, kernels form a category of similarity functions, and a positive definite kernel enables us to leverage abundant techniques of multivariate analysis. This paper aims to fill the gap between distances and kernels. In the literature, we have several formulas that convert a negative definite distance function into a positive definite kernel. Edit distance functions, however, are not necessarily negative definite, and our first contribution is to introduce an alternative method to derive positive definite kernels from edit distance functions that are not necessarily negative definite. The method is equipped with an easy-to-check and strong sufficient condition for positive definiteness, and the condition turns out to be tightly related with the triangle inequality. In fact, to our knowledge, all of the edit distance functions in the literature that support the triangle inequality meet the condition for positive definiteness. Secondly, we apply this method to four well-known edit distance functions for trees to introduce four novel kernels and show that three of them are positive definite. Thirdly, we develop a theory of subtree matching to study these kernels. Our kernels count matchings between subtrees of the input trees with weights determined according to individual matchings. Although the number of such matchings is an exponential function of the size of the input trees (the number of vertices), our theory enables us to develop dynamic-programming-based algorithms, whose asymptotic computational complexities fall between a quadratic function and a cubic function of the size.

This model was at the origin of important developments in the Discrete Geometry field (ReveillSs and Richard, Ann. Math. Artif. Intell. Math. Inform. 16(14), 89-152 (1996)). The formalization is based on the work presented in Chollet et al. (2012, 2009) where it was shown that the Harthong-Reeb line satisfies the axioms for constructive real numbers introduced by Bridges (1999). Laugwitz-Schmieden numbers (Laugwitz 1983) are then introduced and their limitations with respect to being a model of the Harthong-Reeb line is investigated (Chollet et al., Theor. Comput. Sci. 466, 2-19 (2012)). In this paper, we transpose all these definitions and properties into a formal description using the Coq proof assistant. We also show that Laugwitz-Schmieden numbers can be used to actually compute continuous functions. We hope that this work could improve techniques for both implementing numeric computations and reasoning about them in geometric systems.

Fundamental objects that are investigated are the complex plane (usually extended by a single infinite point), its objects (points, lines and circles), and groups of transformations that act on them (e.g., inversions and Mobius transformations). In this paper, we treat the geometry of complex numbers formally and present a fully mechanically verified development within the theorem prover Isabelle/HOL. Apart from applications in formalizing mathematics and in education, this work serves as a ground for formally investigating various non-Euclidean geometries and their intimate connections. We discuss different approaches to formalization and discuss the major advantages of the more algebraically oriented approach.

However, because of the harsh indoor conditions, current indoor localisation systems remain either too expensive or not accurate enough. In this paper, we tackle the latter issue in a different direction, with a new conformal prediction algorithm to enhance the accuracy of the prediction. We handle the common indoor signal attenuation issue, which introduces errors into the training database, with a reliability measurement for our prediction. We show why our approach performs better than other solutions through empirical studies with two testbeds. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to apply conformal prediction for the localisation purpose in general, and for the indoor localisation in particular.

JET-EFDA Contributors	Preliminary numerical investigations of conformal predictors based on fuzzy logic classifiers	ANNALS OF MATHEMATICS AND ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						Conformal predictors; Fuzzy logic; Membership function; Non conformity score	CONFIDENCE MACHINES; NEURAL-NETWORKS; RECOGNITION	A new family of techniques, called conformal predictors, have very recently been developed to hedge the estimates of machine learning methods, by providing two parameters, credibility and confidence, which can assess the level of trust that can be attributed to their outputs. In this paper, the main steps required to extend this approach to fuzzy logic classifiers are reported. The more delicate aspect is the definition of an appropriate nonconformity score, which has to be based on the fuzzy membership function to preserve the specificities of Fuzzy Logic. Various examples of increasing complexity are introduced, to describe the main properties of fuzzy logic based conformal predictors and to compare their performance with alternative approaches. The obtained results are quite promising, since conformal predictors based on fuzzy classifiers outperform solutions based on the nearest neighbour in terms of ambiguity, robustness and interpretability.

The structure of the relation can then be described in terms of lattice theory. On the other hand Q -analysis associates a simplicial complex to a binary relation and studies its properties using topological methods. This paper investigates which mathematical invariants studied in one approach can be captured in the other. Our main result is that all homotopy invariant properties of the simplicial complex can be recovered from the structure of the concept lattice. This not only clarifies the relationships between two frameworks widely used in symbolic data analysis but also offers an effective new method to establish homotopy equivalence in the context of Q -analysis. As a musical application, we will investigate Olivier Messiaen's modes of limited transposition. We will use our theoretical result to show that the simplicial complex associated to a maximal mode with m transpositions is homotopy equivalent to the (m-2)-dimensional sphere.

From the very beginning, measures of the accuracy of heuristic functions were strongly based on the number of nodes generated, and they are often still based on it. In this work, an alternative approach is suggested: to model the accuracy of admissible heuristic functions as the probability of the heuristic hill-climbing search algorithm to find the goal state in a number of steps that equals the heuristic value of an arbitrary node. The resulting method serves to assess on the accuracy of both consistent and inconsistent heuristic functions. Comparisons with different sizes of the sliding-tile puzzle show that the model suggested predicts the accuracy of the heuristic function with a good precision. The resulting procedure is used to derive figures on the accuracy of a large number of heuristics for the 15-Puzzle with different variants of the search algorithm IDA(au).

J	Arieli, O; Zamansky, A				Arieli, Ofer; Zamansky, Anna			A dissimilarity-based framework for generating inconsistency-tolerant logics	ANNALS OF MATHEMATICS AND ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						Reasoning with inconsistency; Dissimilarity-based entailments	DISTANCE SEMANTICS	Many commonly used logics, including classical logic and intuitionistic logic, are trivialized in the presence of inconsistency, in the sense that inconsistent premises cause the derivation of any formula. It is thus often useful to define inconsistency-tolerant variants of such logics, which are faithful to the original logic with respect to consistent theories but also allow for nontrivial inconsistent theories. A common way of doing so is by incorporating distance-based considerations for concrete logics. So far this has been done mostly in the context of two-valued semantics. Our purpose in this paper is to show that inconsistency-tolerance can be achieved for any logic that is based on a denotational semantics. For this, we need to trade distances for the more general notion of dissimilarities. We then examine the basic properties of the entailment relations that are obtained and exemplify dissimilarity-based reasoning in various forms of denotational semantics, including multi-valued semantics, non-deterministic semantics, and possible-worlds (Kripke-style) semantics. Moreover, we show that our approach can be viewed as an extension of several well-studied forms of reasoning in the context of belief revision, database integration, consistent query answering, and inconsistency maintenance in knowledge-based systems.

They have been proven very useful in e.g., relational databases for reducing data redundancy. Little work however has been done so far for using them in the context of data cubes. In the present paper, we propose to characterize the parts of a data cube to be materialized with the help of the FD's present in the underlying data. For this purpose, we consider two applications: (i) how to choose the best cuboids of a data cube to materialize in order to guarantee a fixed performance of query evaluation and, (ii) how to choose the best tuples, hence partial cuboids, in order to reduce the size of the data cube without loosing information. In both cases FD's turn to be fundamental in characterizing the solutions of these problems.

In this paper, we elaborate on the computability and complexity issues of the ERDF stable model semantics. Based on the undecidability result of ERDF stable model semantics, decidability under this semantics cannot be achieved, unless ERDF ontologies of restricted syntax are considered. Therefore, we propose a slightly modified semantics for ERDF ontologies, called ERDF #n-stable model semantics. We show that entailment under this semantics is, in general, decidable and also extends RDFS entailment. Equivalence statements between the two semantics are provided. Additionally, we provide algorithms that compute the ERDF #n-stable models of syntax-restricted and general ERDF ontologies. Further, we provide complexity results for the ERDF #n-stable model semantics on syntax-restricted and general ERDF ontologies. Finally, we provide complexity results for the ERDF stable model semantics on syntax-restricted ERDF ontologies.

Combinatorial and discrete geometric problems in image analysis	ANNALS OF MATHEMATICS AND ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						Discrete geometry; Discrete structure; Combinatorial image analysis		Image analysis is a scientific discipline which provides theoretical foundations and methods for solving problems appearing in a range of areas as diverse as biology, medicine, physics, astronomy, chemistry, robotics, industrial manufacturing, and security. The very nature of the subject of image analysis determines its close relations to various facets of artificial intelligence. Unlike traditional approaches, which are based on continuous models requiring float arithmetic computations and rounding, "combinatorial" (or "discrete") approaches are based on studying combinatorial properties of discrete structures. They provide models and algorithms, which often appear to be more efficient and accurate than those based on continuous models. Some recent combinatorial approaches aim at constructing a self-contained digital topology and geometry, which might be of interest and importance not only for image analysis, but also as independent mathematical disciplines.

This task can be underdetermined, meaning that several binary images can have the same projections, especially when only one or two projections are given. On the other hand, it is known that a binary image can be exactly reconstructed from its morphological skeleton when all skeletal labels are known. However, if only the skeletal points are given, different labellings yield different reconstructed images. In this paper, we consider a mixture of the above problems, reconstructing a binary image from few projections and the morphological skeleton. We show that the problem is NP-complete, yet a result with low projection and pixel error usually can be achieved, even if only a single projection is available. Three different variants of a method based on Simulated Annealing are developed and compared with respect to reconstruction time and error using artificial binary images.

This study is relevant for maximal margin separations, which appear in Support Vector Machines (SVM), as well as for separations that optimize a Chebyshev norm. We propose a new version of the Stiefel exchange algorithm where we exploit the property that each Stiefel exchange is in fact a Radon exchange. Originally, the Stiefel exchange algorithm was developed to find Chebyshev approximations, but we show that it is also suited for finding hyperplane separations. We also show that many important properties in approximation theory are closely related to fundamental results in convex set theory, in particular to Helly's, Radon's and Caratheodory's Theorem. Within this context, we prove a new result that generalizes both Radon's and Caratheodory's Theorem.

It computes a crease pattern of a convex polygonal region, starting with a compatible metric tree. Although it has been informally described in several publications, neither the full power nor the inherent limitations of the method are well understood. In this paper we introduce a rigorous mathematical formalism to relate the input metric tree, the output crease pattern and the folded uniaxial origami base produced by the Universal Molecule algorithm. We characterize the family of tree-like 3D shapes that are foldable from the computed crease patterns and give a correctness proof of the algorithm.

Many real world data, like biological sequences are not vectorial, often non-euclidean and given only in the form of (dis-)similarities between examples, requesting for efficient and interpretable models. Vectorial embeddings or transformations to get a valid kernel are limited and current dissimilarity classifiers often lead to dense complex models which are hard to interpret by domain experts. They also fail to provide additional information about the confidence of the classification. In this paper we propose a prototype-based conformal classifier for dissimilarity data. It is based on a prototype dissimilarity learner and extended by the conformal prediction methodology. It (i) can deal with dissimilarity data characterized by an arbitrary symmetric dissimilarity matrix, (ii) offers intuitive classification in terms of sparse prototypical class representatives, (iii) leads to state-of-the-art classification results supported by a confidence measure and (iv) the model complexity is automatically adjusted. In experiments on dissimilarity data we investigate the effectiveness with respect to accuracy and model complexity in comparison to different state of the art classifiers.

Simulations of nuclear fusion diagnostics based on projections with Venn predictors and context drift detection	ANNALS OF MATHEMATICS AND ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						Venn predictors; Conformal predictors; Context drift detection; Nuclear fusion diagnostics	CONFORMAL PREDICTORS; X-RAY; CLASSIFICATION; RECOGNITION; TOMOGRAPHY	Tomography is used to reconstruct the inside cross section of an inaccesible object. To this end, a high number of cross section projections are required. In nuclear fusion devices, the plasma follows a toroidal shape and tomography can be used to estimate the two-dimensional spatial distribution of the plasma emission through a cross section. One of the objectives of tomography in plasma physics is to determine the number of localized emission peaks within the cross-section. Due to space restrictions in fusion devices, only a very limited number of projections can be experimentally measured and this introduces limitations to detect the number of emission peaks in the cross-section. This article describes a set of simulations to show that a multi-class classification system can be a valid alternative to tomography in plasma physics, even with the data of a single projection. Each class of the classifier represents the number of perturbations that can appear at any time in the plasma emissivity. To ensure the accuracy and reliability of the predictions, probabilistic classifiers (Venn predictors and Bayesian classifiers) have been used, with more reliable results from the Venn predictors. The probability intervals of Venn predictors with a single projection and intense/low respectively perturbations are [0.85, 0.93] and [0.62, 0.71] (to be compared with a probability 0.2 of a class random assignation). However, when the perturbation peaks are not strong enough and are lost into the emissivity background, the determination of the number of emission peaks can produce unreliable results. In these cases, to detect the plasma transition from an unperturbed state to a perturbed one (regardless of the number of perturbations) a martingale framework has been used. The changes have been detected by testing exchangeability with two different martingales: randomized power martingale and simple mixture martingale. Neither false alarms nor missed alarms have been observed with the former one and the average delay in the change recognition is between 16 and 72 samples (depending on cases). This means between 16 and 72 ms if the sampling period is 1 ms (it should be noted that the discharge length in ITER will be 50 min).

J	Rajagopalan, K; Srinivasan, V; Thomo, A				Rajagopalan, Krishnan; Srinivasan, Venkatesh; Thomo, Alex			A model for learning the news in social networks	ANNALS OF MATHEMATICS AND ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						Social networks; Information propagation; Timestamps		In social media such as Facebook, the most popular desire is to learn the news about other people. In this paper, we study the following problem related to information propagation: Suppose that there is a set U of N users in a social network. They meet online from time to time and share information they know about themselves and the other users in the network. Whenever a group g aS,aEuro parts per thousand U of users meet, they want to know who has the latest information about every user in U. A naive solution to this problem is to use timestamps. However, there are drawbacks to this scheme including the burden on the users to maintain reliable timestamps and the fact that the timestamps grow unbounded over time. It is natural to ask if it is possible to learn the latest information without using timestamps. We present an efficient method which removes the need to timestamp user information (news). Instead, only the meetings of the groups have to be indexed. Furthermore, we show that this indexing can be performed using a finite set of labels so that each user stores at most O(N (2) logN) bits of information. We also show that this bound can be improved in some cases if we have further information on the topology of the network.
