In particular, when alpha + beta >= 2, it is shown that if partial derivative(y)theta is an element of L-q (0, T; L-p (R-2)) with a/q + 2/p <= alpha + beta - 1, then the solution theta can also be smoothly extended after time T.

Let chi(lambda) be the unit band spectral projection operator associated with the Neumann Laplacian and f be a square integrable function on M. The authors show the following gradient estimate for chi(lambda) f as lambda >= 1: parallel to del chi(lambda) f parallel to(infinity) <= C(lambda parallel to chi(lambda) f parallel to(infinity) + lambda(-1)parallel to Delta chi(lambda) f parallel to(infinity)), where C is a positive constant depending only on M. As a corollary, the authors obtain the gradient estimate of e(lambda): For every lambda >= 1, it holds that parallel to del e(lambda)parallel to(infinity) <= C lambda parallel to e(lambda)parallel to(infinity).

For this purpose, the authors study differential operators on an admissible algebra. Firstly, differential operators from a path algebra to its quotient algebra as an admissible algebra are discussed. Based on this discussion, the first cohomology with admissible algebras as coefficient modules is characterized, including their dimension formula. Besides, for planar quivers, the k-linear bases of the first cohomology of acyclic complete monomial algebras and acyclic truncated quiver algebras are constructed over the field k of characteristic 0.

More precisely, based on the local existence of the three-dimensional compressible viscous magnetohydrodynamic equations, first the convergence-stability principle is established. Then it is shown that, when the Mach number is sufficiently small, the periodic initial value problems of the equations have a unique smooth solution in the time interval, where the incompressible viscous magnetohydrodynamic equations have a smooth solution. When the latter has a global smooth solution, the maximal existence time for the former tends to infinity as the Mach number goes to zero. Moreover, the authors prove the convergence of smooth solutions of the equations towards those of the incompressible viscous magnetohydrodynamic equations with a sharp convergence rate.

Within a "small deformation" setting, a suite of simplified and interesting models consisting of a nonlocal Ginzburg Landau equation, a nonlocal level set equation, and a nonlocal generalized Burgers equation is derived. In the finite deformation setting, it is shown that an additive decomposition of the total velocity gradient into elastic and plastic parts emerges naturally from a micromechanical starting point that involves no notion of plastic deformation but only the elastic distortion, material velocity, dislocation density and the dislocation velocity. Moreover, a plastic spin tensor emerges naturally as well.

This method relies on a penalty treatment of the nonlinearity, a biharmonic regularization of the resulting variational problem, and the time discretization by operator-splitting of an initial value problem associated with the Euler-Lagrange equations of the regularized variational problem. A low-order finite element discretization is advocated since it is well-suited to the low regularity of the solutions. Numerical experiments show that the method sketched above can capture efficiently the extremal solutions of various two-dimensional test problems and that it has also the ability of handling easily domains with curved boundaries.

The compactness and convergence of vanishing viscosity solutions for nonlinear hyperbolic conservation laws are first analyzed, including the inviscid limit from the Navier-Stokes equations to the Euler equations for homentropic flow, the vanishing viscosity method to construct the global spherically symmetric solutions to the multidimensional compressible Euler equations, and the sonic-subsonic limit of solutions of the full Euler equations for multi-dimensional steady compressible fluids. Then the weak continuity and rigidity of the Gauss-Codazzi-Ricci system and corresponding isometric embeddings in differential geometry are revealed. Further references are also provided for some recent developments on the weak continuity and compactness for nonlinear partial differential equations.

The problem of feedback stabilization under proportional-integral-derivative (PID for short) boundary control is addressed. In the proportional-integral (PI for short) controller case, by spectral analysis, the authors provide a complete characterization of the set of stabilizing feedback parameters, and determine the corresponding time delay stability interval. Moreover, the stability of the equilibrium is discussed by Lyapunov function techniques, and by this approach the exponential stability when a damping term is added to the classical PI controller scheme is proved. Also, based on Pontryagin results on stability for quasipolynomials, it is shown that the closed-loop system subject to PID control is always unstable.

In dimension two this inequality plays a role similar to that of the Sobolev inequality in higher dimensions. After justifying this statement by recovering the Onofri inequality through various limiting procedures and after reviewing some known results, the authors state several elementary remarks. Various new results are also proved in this paper. A proof of the inequality is given by using mass transportation methods (in the radial case), consistently with similar results for Sobolev inequalities. The authors investigate how duality can be used to improve the Onofri inequality, in connection with the logarithmic Hardy-Littlewood-Sobolev inequality. In the framework of fast diffusion equations, it is established that the inequality is an entropy-entropy production inequality, which provides an integral remainder term. Finally, a proof of the inequality based on rigidity methods is given and a related nonlinear flow is introduced.

Among the various simplifications which have been proposed, the surface pressure model leads to a hierarchy of simpler models including one that involves only the pressure. The model exhibits fundamental frequencies which can be computed and compared with the pulse. Yet unconditionally stable time discretizations can be constructed by combining implicit time schemes with Galerkin-characteristic discretization of the convection terms in the Navier-Stokes equations. Such problems with prescribed pressure on the walls will be shown to be efficient and accurate as an approximation of the full fluid structure interaction problem.

Since a scalar equation generates usually stable waves, the simplest mathematical description relies on two-by-two reaction-diffusion systems. The authors' interest is the extension of the Fisher/KPP equation to a two-species reaction which represents reactant concentration and temperature when used for flame propagation, and bacterial population and nutrient concentration when used in biology. The authors study circumstances in which instabilities can occur and in particular the effect of dimension. It is observed numerically that spherical waves can be unstable depending on the coefficients. A simpler mathematical framework is to study transversal instability, which means a one-dimensional wave propagating in two space dimensions. Then, explicit analytical formulas give explicitely the range of paramaters for instability.

A numerical method based on elliptic solvers is presented here to solve two different kinds of steady Eikonal equations and compute solutions, which are maximal and minimal in the variational sense. The approach in this paper relies on a variational argument involving penalty, a biharmonic regularization, and an operator-splitting-based time-discretization scheme for the solution of an associated initial-value problem. This approach allows the decoupling of the nonlinearities and differential operators. Numerical experiments are performed to validate this approach and investigate its convergence properties from a numerical viewpoint.

Using a variant of Moser's twist theorem of invariant curves, the authors show the existence of quasi-periodic solutions and boundedness of all solutions.

The estimators of parameter beta(0) are derived by using the nearest neighbor-generalized randomly weighted least absolute deviation (LAD for short) method. The resulting estimator of the unknown vector beta(0) is shown to be consistent and asymptotically normal. In addition, the results facilitate the construction of confidence regions and the hypothesis testing for the unknown parameters. Extensive simulations are reported, showing that the proposed method works well in practical settings. The proposed methods are also applied to a data set from the study of an AIDS clinical trial group.

By introducing the corresponding pseudo-potential systems, the authors systematically construct some generalized symmetries that consider some new smooth functions {X-i beta}(beta= 1,2,...,N)(i=1,2,...,n) depending on a finite number of partial derivatives of the nonlocal variables upsilon(beta) and a restriction Sigma(i,alpha,beta) (partial derivative xi(i)/partial derivative upsilon(beta))(2) + (partial derivative eta(alpha)/partial derivative upsilon(beta))(2) not equal 0, i.e., Sigma(i,alpha,beta) (partial derivative G(alpha)/partial derivative upsilon(beta))(2) not equal 0. Furthermore, the authors investigate some structures associated with the Olver water wave (AOWW) equations including Lie algebra and Darboux transformation. The results are also extended to AOWW equations such as Lax, Sawada-Kotera, Kaup-Kupershmidt, Ito and Caudrey-Dodd-Gibbon-Sawada-Kotera equations, et al.

In this paper, under more general conditions, the authors investigate the combined effect of the internal dissipative condition and the boundary dissipative condition, and prove the global existence and exponential decay of the C-1 solution to the mixed initial-boundary value problem for quasilinear hyperbolic systems with small initial data. This stability result is applied to a kind of models, and an example is given to show the possible exponential instability if the corresponding conditions are not satisfied.

J	Chen, ZX; Cao, FL				Chen, Zhixiang; Cao, Feilong			Spherical Scattered Data Quasi-interpolation by Gaussian Radial Basis Function	CHINESE ANNALS OF MATHEMATICS SERIES B			English	Article						Scattered data; Approximation; Spherical Gaussian radial basis function; Modulus of continuity	POSITIVE-DEFINITE FUNCTIONS; SOBOLEV SPACES; SPHERES; APPROXIMATION; KERNELS	Since the spherical Gaussian radial function is strictly positive definite, the authors use the linear combinations of translations of the Gaussian kernel to interpolate the scattered data on spheres in this article. Seeing that target functions are usually outside the native spaces, and that one has to solve a large scaled system of linear equations to obtain combinatorial coefficients of interpolant functions, the authors first probe into some problems about interpolation with Gaussian radial functions. Then they construct quasi-interpolation operators by Gaussian radial function, and get the degrees of approximation. Moreover, they show the error relations between quasi-interpolation and interpolation when they have the same basis functions. Finally, the authors discuss the construction and approximation of the quasi-interpolant with a local support function.

Based on the Toda bracket <alpha(1)beta(p-1)(1), alpha(1)beta(1), p, gamma(s)>, the authors show that the relation alpha(1)beta(p-1)(1)h(2,0)gamma(s)= beta(p)/(p-1)gamma(s) holds. As a result, they can obtain alpha(1)beta(p)(1)h(2,0)gamma(s) = 0 is an element of pi(*)(S-0) for 2 <= s <= p - 2, even though alpha(1)h(2,0)gamma(s) and beta(1)alpha(1)h(2,0)gamma(s) are not trivial. They also prove that beta(p-1)(1) alpha(1)h(2,0)gamma(3) is nontrivial in pi(*)(S-0) and conjecture that beta(p-1)(1) alpha(1)h(2,0)gamma(s) is nontrivial in pi(*)(S-0) for 3 <= s <= p - 2. Moreover, it is known that beta(p/p-1)gamma(3) = 0 is an element of Ext(BP*BP)(5,*) (BP*, BP*), but beta(p/p-1)gamma(3) is nontrivial in pi(*)(S-0) and represents the element beta(p-1)(1) alpha(1)h(2,0)gamma(3).

The authors determine the extendabilities for all periodical maps on Sigma(2). The results involve various orientation preserving/reversing behalves of the periodical maps on the pair (S-3, Sigma(g)). To do this the authors first list all periodic maps on Sigma(2), and indeed the authors exhibit each of them as a composition of primary and explicit symmetries, like rotations, reflections and antipodal maps, which itself should be interesting. A by-product is that for each even g, the maximum order periodic map on Sigma(g) is extendable, which contrasts sharply with the situation in the orientation preserving category.

Let 0 < p < infinity be a fixed number and let I be an interval contained in R. The author shows that for any phi : I -> R and any subset E subset of I of positive measure, vertical bar I vertical bar(-1/p) / vertical bar E vertical bar(-1/p) integral(E) vertical bar phi-1/vertical bar I vertical bar integral(I) phi dy vertical bar dx <= parallel to phi parallel to BMO (I), 0< p <= 2, vertical bar I vertical bar(-1/p) / vertical bar E vertical bar(-1/p) integral(E) vertical bar phi-1/vertical bar I vertical bar integral(I) phi dy vertical bar dx <= p/2(2/p) e(2/p-1) parallel to phi parallel to BMO (I), p >= 2. For each p, the constant on the right-hand side is the best possible. The proof rests on the explicit evaluation of the associated Bellman function. The result is a complement of the earlier works of Slavin, Vasyunin and Volberg concerning weak-type, L-p and exponential bounds for the BMO class.

Some uniqueness results are obtained, which imply that the pair of potentials (p(x), r(x)) and a boundary condition are uniquely determined even if only partial information is given on (p(x), r(x)) together with partial information on the spectral data, consisting of either one full spectrum and a subset of norming constants, or a subset of pairs of eigenvalues and the corresponding norming constants. Moreover, the authors are also concerned with the situation where both p(x) and r(x) are C-n-smoothness at some given point.

Under the entropy conditions, the unique solution in a neighborhood of the origin on the (x, t) plane (t > 0) is obtained. It is found that, for some cases, the perturbed Riemann solutions are essentially different from the corresponding Riemann solutions. The perturbation may transform a strong detonation into a weak deflagration in the neighborhood of the origin. Especially, it can be observed that burning happens although the corresponding Riemann solution does not contain combustion wave, which exhibits the instability for the unburnt state.

A local active coordinate system in a small neighborhood of homoclinic orbit is introduced. By analysis of the bifurcation equation, the authors obtain the conditions when the original flip homoclinic orbit is kept or broken. The existence and the existence regions of several double periodic orbits and one triple periodic orbit bifurcations are proved. Moreover, the complicated homoclinic-doubling bifurcations are found and expressed approximately.

Then, taking into account the effect of environmental noise, the authors incorporate white noise in both Rossler and Lorentz systems to have a corresponding stochastic system. By deriving the uniform a priori estimates for an approximate system and then taking them to the limit, the authors prove the global existence, uniqueness and the pathwise property of solutions to the Lorentz-Rossler system. Moreover, the authors carried out a number of numerical experiments, and the numerical results demonstrate their theoretic analysis and show some new qualitative properties of solutions which reveal that the Lorentz-Rossler system could be used to design more complex and more secure nonlinear hop-frequence time series.
