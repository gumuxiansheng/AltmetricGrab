The main new feature of the constructed solutions is that they solve the problem locally, which is the appropriate notion for the examination of local properties like regularity. As an application, we derive Caldern-Zygmund estimates for the spatial gradient of localizable solutions to parabolic obstacle problems.

Our results extend the known interior regularity for such obstacle problems in Lebesgue spaces to the boundary one in Orlicz spaces. The domain under consideration is a delta-Reifenberg domain which is a natural extension of a Lipschitz one with a small Lipschitz constant, while the function space under consideration is an Orlicz space which is a natural generalization of the Lebesgue space.

Thus, we consider the groups SL (m) (D), with D a central division algebra over F of dimension d (2), and m = n/d. We use the generalized Jacquet-Langlands correspondence and results of the first named author to describe the zeros of Plancherel measures. Combined with a study of the behavior of the stabilizer of representations by elements of the Weyl group we are able to determine the Knapp-Stein R-groups in terms of those for SL (n) (F). We show the R-group for the inner form embeds as a subgroup of the R-group for the split form, and we characterize the quotient. We are further able to show the Knapp-Stein R-group is isomorphic to the Arthur, or Endoscopic R-group as predicted by Arthur. Finally, we give some results on multiplicities and actions of Weyl groups on L-packets.

J	Chen, YF				Chen, Yifan			Commuting involutions on surfaces of general type with p (g)=0 and K (2)=7	MANUSCRIPTA MATHEMATICA			English	Article							BICANONICAL MAP; INOUE SURFACES; MODULI; P(G)=0; COMPONENT; K-2=7	The aim of this article is to classify the pairs (S, G), where S is a smooth minimal surface of general type with p (g) = 0 and K (2) = 7, G is a subgroup of the automorphism group of S and G is isomorphic to the group . We show that there are only three possible cases for such pairs. Two of them correspond to known examples, but the existence of the third one remains an open problem. The Inoue surfaces with K (2) = 7, which are finite Galois -covers of the 4-nodal cubic surface, are the first examples of such pairs. More recently, the author constructed a new family of such pairs. They are finite Galois -covers of certain 6-nodal Del Pezzo surfaces of degree one. We prove that the base of the Kuranishi family of deformations of a surface in this family is smooth. We show that, in the Gieseker moduli space of canonical models of surfaces of general type, the subset corresponding to the surfaces in this family is an irreducible connected component, normal, unirational of dimension 3.

By determining the coefficients of the invariant Levi-Civita connection on a Siegel upper half plane, and further by calculating the expressions of the differential forms under this connection, we get a non-holomorphic derivative operator of the Siegel modular forms. In order to get a holomorphic derivative operator, we introduce a weaker notion, called modular connection, on the Siegel upper half plane.

In this paper we derive differential Harnack estimates for positive solutions to the nonlinear heat equation with potential: partial derivative f/partial derivative t = Delta f + gamma(t) f log f + aSf, where gamma(t) is a continuous function on t, a is a constant and S = g(ij)S(ij) is the trace of S-ij. Our Harnack estimates include many known results as special cases, and moreover lead to new Harnack inequalities for a variety geometric flows.

When the representation type of the group algebra is not wild, the group structure of T (G) is known for the cases where a Sylow p-subgroup P of G is cyclic, semi-dihedral and generalized quaternion. We investigate T(G), and more accurately, its torsion subgroup TT(G) for the case where P is a Klein-four group. More precisely, we give a necessary and sufficient condition in terms of the centralizers of involutions under which TT ( G) = f(-1)(X(NG(P))) holds, where f(-1)(X (NG( P))) denotes the abelian group consisting of the kG-Green correspondents of the one-dimensional kN(G) (P)-modules. We show that the lift to characteristic zero of any indecomposable module in TT(G) affords an irreducible ordinary character. Furthermore, we show that the property of a module in,f(-1)(X(NG(P))) of being endo-trivial is not intrinsic to the module itself but is decided at the level of the block to which it belongs.

Let f(C)(an) : Y-C(an) -> X-C(an) denote the associated morphism of complex analytic spaces. For x is an element of X (C) write H for the Betti cohomology of with Y-C,x(an) coefficients in and for x is an element of X, write H-l for the l-adic cohomology of with coefficients in (Under our assumptions on and are independent of x). For every prime a"", let be the set of all where the Zariski closure of the image of the Galois representation has dimension strictly smaller than the dimension of . By previous works of A.

Let denote the Zariski closure of the image of the monodromy representation . Then is a semi-simple algebraic group of rank-say-r. The main result of this note is that for is a semi-simple algebraic group of rank r.

The primary purpose of the present paper is studying the boundary behavior of nonnegative functions in the class . Since viscosity solutions to (0.1) are in this class, it follows that our results provide corresponding statements for nonnegative viscosity solutions to (0.1) as a special case.

In this case, is a line bundle on C. This paper continues the study of deformations of Y to curves with smooth irreducible components, when the number of components is maximal (it is then the multiplicity n of Y). If a primitive double curve Y can be deformed to reduced curves with smooth components intersecting transversally, then . We prove that conversely, if L is the ideal sheaf of a divisor with no multiple points, then Y can be deformed to reduced curves with smooth components intersecting transversally.

J	Gendulphe, M				Gendulphe, Matthieu			The Schwarz's lemma and the upper bound for an injectivity radius of surfaces	MANUSCRIPTA MATHEMATICA			French	Article								We study the injectivity radius of complete Riemannian surfaces (S, g) with bounded curvature . We show that if S is orientable with nonabelian fundamental group, then there is a point with injectivity radius R arcsinh. This lower bound is sharp independently of the topology of S. This result was conjectured by Bavard who has already proved the genus zero cases (Bavard 1984). We establish a similar inequality for surfaces with boundary.

We establish existence theorems for the Hamiltonian and the momentum constraints with constant mean curvature and with a background metric that satisfies very low regularity assumptions. These results extend the regularity results of Holst et al. (Commun Math Phys 288: 547-613, 2009) about the constraint equations on compact manifolds in the Besov space B-p,p(s), to asymptotically flat manifolds. We also consider the Brill-Cantor criterion in the weighted Besov spaces. Our results improve the regularity assumptions on asymptotically flat manifolds (Choquet-Bruhat et al. in Chin Ann Math Ser B 27(1), 31-52, 2006; Maxwell in Commun Math Phys 253(3): 561-583, 2005), as well as they enable us to construct the initial data for the Einstein-Euler system.

J	Linowitz, B				Linowitz, Benjamin			Selective orders in central simple algebras and isospectral families of arithmetic manifolds	MANUSCRIPTA MATHEMATICA			English	Article							QUATERNION ALGEBRAS; EMBEDDING THEOREM	Let k be a number field and B be a central simple algebra over k of dimension p (2) where p is prime. In the case that p = 2 we assume that B is not totally definite. In this paper we study sets of pairwise nonisomorphic maximal orders of B with the property that a -order of rank p embeds into either every maximal order in the set or into none at all. Such a set is called nonselective. We prove upper and lower bounds for the cardinality of a maximal nonselective set. This problem is motivated by the inverse spectral problem in differential geometry. In particular we use our results to clarify a theorem of Vign,ras on the construction of isospectral nonisometric hyperbolic surfaces and 3-manifolds from orders in quaternion algebras. We conclude by giving an example of isospectral nonisometric hyperbolic surfaces which arise from a quaternion algebra exhibiting selectivity.

J	Axelsson, R; Biswas, I; Schumacher, G				Axelsson, Reynir; Biswas, Indranil; Schumacher, Georg			Kahler structure on Hurwitz spaces	MANUSCRIPTA MATHEMATICA			English	Article							MODULI SPACE; CURVES; MANIFOLDS	The classical Hurwitz spaces, that parameterize compact Riemann surfaces equipped with covering maps to of fixed numerical type with simple branch points, are extensively studied in the literature.We apply deformation theory, and present a study of the Kahler structure of the Hurwitz spaces, which reflects the variation of the complex structure of the Riemann surface as well as the variation of the meromorphic map. We introduce a generalized Weil-Petersson Kahler form on the Hurwitz space. This form turns out to be the curvature of a Quillen metric on a determinant line bundle. Alternatively, the generalized Weil-Petersson Kahler form can be characterized as the curvature form of the hermitian metric on the Deligne pairing of the relative canonical line bundle and the pull back of the anti-canonical line bundle on . Replacing the projective line by an arbitrary but fixed curve Y, we arrive at a generalized Hurwitz space with similar properties. The determinant line bundle extends to a compactification of the (generalized) Hurwitz space as a line bundle, and the Quillen metric yields a singular hermitian metric on the compactification so that a power of the determinant line bundle provides an embedding of the Hurwitz space in a projective space.

This is an equivalence between a suitable notion of stability for a pair , where is a locally-free sheaf over a surface X and is a section of End; and the existence of a solution to certain gauge-theoretic equations, the Vafa-Witten equations, for a Hermitian metric on . It turns out to be a special case of results obtained by Alvarez-Cnsul and Garcia-Prada on the quiver vortex equation. In this article, we give an alternative proof which uses a Mehta-Ramanathan style argument originally developed by Donaldson for the Hermitian-Einstein problem, as it relates the subject with the Hitchin equations on Riemann surfaces, and surely indicates a similar proof of the existence of a solution under the assumption of stability for the Donaldson-Thomas instanton equations described in Tanaka (2013) on smooth projective threefolds; and more broadly that for the quiver vortex equation on higher dimensional smooth projective varieties.

J	Ludewig, M				Ludewig, Matthias			A semiclassical heat kernel proof of the Poincare-Hopf theorem	MANUSCRIPTA MATHEMATICA			English	Article							MORSE; FORMS	We consider the semiclassical asymptotic expansion of the heat kernel coming from Witten's perturbation of the de Rham complex by a given function. For the index, one obtains a time-dependent integral formula which is evaluated by the method of stationary phase to derive the Poincare-Hopf theorem. We show how this method is related to approaches using the Thom form of Mathai and Quillen. Afterwards, we use a more general version of the stationary phase approximation in the case that the perturbing function has critical submanifolds to derive a degenerate version of the Poincare-Hopf theorem.

(Generalised billiard orbits are usual billiard orbits if T has smooth boundary.) This algorithm is finite if T is a polygon and provides an approximation scheme in general. As an illustration, we show that the shortest generalised closed billiard orbit in a regular n-gon R (n) is 2-bounce for , with length twice the width of R (n) . As an application we obtain an algorithm computing the Ekeland-Hofer-Zehnder capacity of the four-dimensional domain in the standard symplectic vector space . Our method is based on the work of Bezdek-Bezdek (Geom. Dedicata 141:197-206, 2009) and on the uniqueness of the Fagnano triangle in acute triangles. It works, more generally, for planar Minkowski billiards.

In a previous paper the second author extended the notion of partial local zeta-functions, by considering for each pair of -ideals and a Poincar, series in m variables, which encodes cardinalities of certain finite sets of ideals. To study the behavior of these power series under blow-ups, we generalize the theory by allowing that is a semilocal ring of the curve. In this context we establish an Euler product identity, which provides the connection between the local and semilocal theory. We further present a procedure to compute the Poincar, series, and illustrate the method by some examples of local rings. Another purpose of this paper is to study the reduction of which becomes a polynomial if m > 1.

Symplectic capacities on surfaces	MANUSCRIPTA MATHEMATICA			English	Article							HAMILTONIAN-DYNAMICS; MANIFOLDS; TOPOLOGY	We classify capacities on the class Sym (o) (2) of connected symplectic surfaces with at most countably many nonplanar ends. To obtain the classification we study diffeomorphism types of surfaces in Sym (o) (2) of infinite genus with nonplanar ends; it turns out that these types are in bijective correspondence with countable successor ordinals of the form omega (alpha) center dot d + 1, where alpha is an ordinal and d a parts per thousand yen 0 is an integer. It also turns out that if S (1) and S (2) are two open surfaces of infinite genera with at most countably many nonplanar ends, then each of the surfaces embeds into the other. Our classification implies that every capacity on the class of symplectic surfaces in Sym (o) (2) of infinite genus differs from the Hofer-Zehnder capacity by a non-negative finite or infinite constant.

These techniques were based on the commuting graph of D (x)/N in the case where D is non-commutative, and on the Milnor K-graph on D (x)/N, in the case where D is commutative. In this paper we unify these two approaches and consider V-graphs on D (x)/N and how they lead to valuations. We furthermore generalize previous results to situations of finitely many valuations.

Given an open variety over a DVR with semistable reduction, the author constructed in that paper a fully faithful algebraization functor from the category of certain log overconvergent isocrystals on the special fiber to the category of modules with regular integrable connection on the generic fiber. In this paper, we prove that, with convenable hypothesis, this functor is a tensor functor whose essential image is closed under extensions and subquotients. As a consequence, we can find suitable Tannakian subcategories of log overconvergent isocrystals and of modules with regular integrable connection on which the algebraization functor is an equivalence of Tannakian categories.
