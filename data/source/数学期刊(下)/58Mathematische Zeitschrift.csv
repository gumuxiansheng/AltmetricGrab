As opposed to the classical case of second order differential operators, here the "boundary data" are prescribed on the complement of a given bounded set. We formulate the problem in the classical framework of Hilbert spaces and prove unique solvability using standard techniques like the Fredholm alternative.

From this point of view, the novelty of this paper is that we study forms with coefficients. However, the main contribution of this paper is conceptual: the discovery of the relationship between multiplicative forms and Cartan's work is explored here to provide a completely new approach to integrability theorems for multiplicative forms. The multiplicative point of view shows that, modulo Lie's functor, the Cartan Pfaffian system (itself a multiplicative form with coefficients!) is the same thing as the classical Spencer operator.			mariasalazarp@gmail.com						36	14	14	0	0	SPRINGER HEIDELBERG	HEIDELBERG	TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY	0025-5874	1432-1823		MATH Z	Math.

One is a local sharp Souplet-Zhang's type and the other is a global Hamilton's type. As applications, we prove parabolic Liouville theorems for ancient solutions satisfying some growth restriction near infinity. In particular the Liouville results are suitable for the gradient shrinking or steady Ricci solitons. The estimates of derivation of the -heat kernel are also obtained.

We introduce the spinor -Toda-Dunkl operators as limits of the difference Dunkl operators in DAHA theory under the spinor variant of the Ruijsenaars procedure. Their general algebraic theory (any reduced root systems) is the key part of this paper, based on the new technique of -spinors and corresponding developments in combinatorics of affine root systems.

We prove a formula that expresses each of those classes as a sum of multi Schur-Pfaffians, whose entries are equivariantly modified special Schubert classes. Our result gives a proof to Wilson's conjectural formula, which generalizes the Giambelli formula for the ordinary cohomology proved by Buch-Kresch-Tamvakis, given in terms of Young's raising operators. Furthermore we show that the formula extends to a certain family of Schubert classes of the symplectic partial isotropic flag varieties.

In the first part, by using the Gauss-Bonnet curvature, which is a natural generalization of the scalar curvature, we introduce a higher order mass, the Gauss-Bonnet-Chern mass , for asymptotically hyperbolic manifolds and show that it is a geometric invariant. Moreover, we prove a positive mass theorem for this new mass for asymptotically hyperbolic graphs and establish a relationship between the corresponding Penrose type inequality for this mass and weighted Alexandrov-Fenchel inequalities in the hyperbolic space . In the second part, we establish these weighted Alexandrov-Fenchel inequalities in for any horospherical convex hypersurface where is the j-th mean curvature of , and is the area of . As an application, we obtain an optimal Penrose type inequality for the new mass defined in the first part for asymptotically hyperbolic graphs with a horizon type boundary , provided that a dominant energy type condition holds.

Let X be a smooth projective spherical variety such that its effective cycle classes of codimension k are nef, where 1 <= k <= dim(X) - 1. We study the properties of X. In particular if X is a toric variety, then X is isomorphic to the product of some projective spaces; if X is toroidal, then X is isomorphic to a rational homogeneous space; if X is horospherical, dim(X) >= 3 and k = 2, then effective divisors on X are nef; if X is horospherical and effective divisors on X are nef, then there is a morphism from X to a rational homogeneous space such that each fiber is isomorphic to the product of some horospherical varieties of Picard number one.

They showed that the Martin boundary is homeomorphic to SG, and used the potential theory on the Martin boundary to induce a harmonic structure on SG. In this paper, we consider a more general Denker-Sato type Markov chain associated with self-similar sets with the open set condition. The chain is defined on the augmented tree of the symbolic space. Such tree was introduced by Kaimanovich, it is hyperbolic in the sense of Gromov (Kaimanovich in Random walks on SierpiA"ski graphs: hyperbolicity and stochastic homogenization, BirhaI < user, Basel, 2003; Lau and Wang in Indiana Univ Math J 58:1777-1795, 2009). We show that the Martin boundary, the hyperbolic boundary and the self-similar set are homeomorphic. The hitting distribution of the chain is also obtained.

For functions which are bounded and continuous at the accessible points, we obtain invariance of the Perron solutions under arbitrary perturbations on the set of inaccessible points. We also obtain some results allowing for jumps and perturbations at a countable set of points.

We also prove a -adic version of the criterion. (These are analogues of the criteria for good reduction of abelian varieties.) The model of the surface will be in general not a scheme but an algebraic space. As a corollary of the criterion we obtain the surjectivity of the period map of K3 surfaces in positive characteristic.

We study the tropicalization map from the moduli space of stable maps into X to the moduli space of tropical curves in S. We prove that it is a continuous map and that its image is compact and polyhedral. Loosely speaking, when we deform algebraic curves in X, the associated tropical curves in S deform continuously; moreover, the locus of realizable tropical curves inside the space of all tropical curves is compact and polyhedral. Our main tools are Berkovich spaces, formal models, balancing conditions, vanishing cycles and quantifier elimination for rigid subanalytic sets.

For cluster algebras from surfaces, each cluster variable is given by a formula whose terms are parametrized by the perfect matchings of a snake graph. In this paper, we continue our study of snake graphs from a combinatorial point of view. We advance the study of abstract snake graphs by introducing the notions of abstract band graphs, self-crossings of abstract snake graphs as well as their resolutions. We show that there is a bijection between the set of perfect matchings of crossing or self-crossing snake graphs and the set of perfect matchings of the resolution of the crossing. In the situation where the snake and band graphs are coming from arcs and loops in a surface without punctures, we obtain a new proof of skein relations in the corresponding cluster algebra.

J	Wilson, JCH				Wilson, Jennifer C. H.			FIW-modules and constraints on classical Weyl group characters	MATHEMATISCHE ZEITSCHRIFT			English	Article							PARTIALLY SYMMETRIC AUTOMORPHISMS; HOMOLOGICAL STABILITY; COHOMOLOGY; REPRESENTATIONS; THEOREM	In this paper we study the characters of sequences of representations of any of the three families of classical Weyl groups : the symmetric groups, the signed permutation groups (hyperoctahedral groups), or the even-signed permutation groups. Our results extend work of Church et al. (Duke Math J, 2012. arXiv:1204.4533; Geom Topol 18(5):2951-2984, 2014) on the symmetric groups. We use the concept of an -module, an algebraic object that encodes the data of a sequence of -representations with maps between them, defined in the author's recent work (J Algebra 420:269-332, 2014). We show that if a sequence of -representations has the structure of a finitely generated -module, then there are substantial constraints on the growth of the sequence and the structure of the characters: for large, the dimension of is equal to a polynomial in , and the characters of are given by a character polynomial in signed-cycle-counting class functions, independent of . We determine bounds the degrees of these polynomials. We continue to develop the theory of -modules, and we apply this theory to obtain new results about a number of sequences associated to the classical Weyl groups: the cohomology of complements of classical Coxeter hyperplane arrangements, and the cohomology of the pure string motion groups (the groups of symmetric automorphisms of the free group).

As a consequence, a compact homogeneous 7-manifold cannot admit an invariant Einstein locally conformal calibrated G(2)-structure unless the underlying metric is flat. In contrast to the compact case, we provide a non-compact example of homogeneous manifold endowed with a locally conformal calibrated G(2)- structure whose associated Rie-mannian metric is Einstein and non Ricci-flat. The homogeneous Einstein metric is a rank-one extension of a Ricci soliton on the 3-dimensional complex Heisenberg group endowed with a left-invariant coupled SU(3)- structure(omega, Psi), i.e., such that d omega = cRe(psi), with c epsilon R - {0}. Nilpotent Lie algebras admitting a coupled SU(3)- structure are also classified.

Our main tool is a lifting result for endotrivial modules obtained in a previous paper which allows us to apply character theoretic methods. As one application we prove that the l-rank of quasi-simple groups possessing a faithful simple endotrivial module is at most 2. As a second application we complete the proof that principal blocks of finite simple groups cannot have Loewy length 4, thus answering a question of Koshitani, Kulshammer and Sambale. Our results also imply a vanishing result for irreducible characters of special linear and unitary groups.

For q - 1, vertical bar u vertical bar(q-2)u will be identified with sgn (u). We establish a variational principle for least energy nodal solutions, and we investigate their qualitative properties. In particular, we show that they satisfy a unique continuation property (their zero set is Lebesgue-negligible). Moreover, if Omega is radial, then least energy nodal solutions are foliated Schwarz symmetric, and they are nonradial in case Omega is a ball. The case q=1 requires special attention since the formally associated energy functional is not differentiable, and many arguments have to be adjusted.

Rauch holds for acute triangles if one of the angles is not larger than . More precisely, we show that the second Neumann eigenfunction on those acute triangles has no maximum or minimum inside the domain. We first simplify the problem by showing that absence of critical points on two sides implies no critical points inside a triangle. This result applies to any acute triangle and might help prove the conjecture for arbitrary acute triangles. Then we show that there are no critical points on two sides assuming one small angle. We also establish simplicity for the smallest positive Neumann eigenvalue for all non-equilateral acute triangles. This result was already known for obtuse triangles, and it fails for the equilateral case.

A lattice is called simple if the space of cusp forms of weight for the dual Weil representation of the lattice is trivial. For a simple lattice every formal principal part obeying obvious conditions is the principal part of a vector valued modular form. Using this, we determine all holomorphic Borcherds products of singular weight (arising from vector valued modular forms with non-negative principal part) for the simple lattices. We construct the corresponding vector valued modular forms by eta products and compute expansions of the automorphic products at different cusps.

J	Gratz, S				Gratz, Sira			Cluster algebras of infinite rank as colimits	MATHEMATISCHE ZEITSCHRIFT			English	Article						Cluster algebras of infinite rank; Rooted cluster algebras; Colimits of cluster algebras	POSITIVITY	We formalize the way in which one can think about cluster algebras of infinite rank by showing that every rooted cluster algebra of infinite rank can be written as a colimit of rooted cluster algebras of finite rank. Our framework is the category of rooted cluster algebras as introduced by Assem, Dupont and Schiffler. Relying on the proof of the posivity conjecture for skew-symmetric cluster algebras of finite rank by Lee and Schiffler, it follows as a direct consequence that the positivity conjecture holds true for cluster algebras of infinite rank. Furthermore, we give a sufficient and necessary condition for a ring homomorphism between cluster algebras to give rise to a rooted cluster morphism without specializations. Assem, Dupont and Schiffler proposed the problem of a classification of ideal rooted cluster morphisms. We provide a partial solution by showing that every rooted cluster morphism without specializations is ideal, but in general rooted cluster morphisms are not ideal.

Due to the lack of an Euler product, one does not expect a Riemann hypothesis for half integer weight modular forms.

For a theta divisor Y on a principally polarized abelian variety, this group G provides a new invariant that naturally endows the moduli space of principally polarized abelian varieties of dimension g with a finite constructible stratification. We determine G for a generic principally polarized abelian variety, and for we show that the stratification detects the locus of Jacobian varieties inside the moduli space of abelian varieties.

Such an algebra is generated by seven functions satisfying functional and differential equations in parallel to the modular functional equations of classical Eisenstein series and the Ramanujan differential equation. Our result is the first example of automorphic-type functions attached to varieties whose period domain is not Hermitian symmetric. It is a reformulation and realization of a problem of Griffiths from the seventies on the existence of automorphic functions for the moduli of polarized Hodge structures.

Rank 2 quasiparabolic vector bundles on P-1 and the variety of linear subspaces contained in two odd-dimensional quadrics	MATHEMATISCHE ZEITSCHRIFT			English	Article							SPACES; CURVES; PLANES; MODULI	Let k be an algebraically closed field of characteristic zero, and consider 2g + 1 distinct points p(1),..., p(2g+1). P-1, where g >= 2. We recall that a rank 2 quasiparabolic vector bundle on the marked curve (P-1, p(1),..., p(2g+1)) is a rank 2 vector bundle V on P1, with the additional data of a one-dimensional subspace F-j of the fiber V-pj of V over p(j), for every j = 1,..., 2g + 1. The notion of stability for quasiparabolic bundles usually depends on the choice of some weights. In this paper we will only consider stability with respect to the weights {0, 1 2} at each marked point, and we will say that a quasiparabolic vector bundle is stable if it is stable with respect to these weights (see Sect. 1.3 and references therein). By [17], there is a fine, projective moduli space N of stable quasiparabolic vector bundles of rank 2 and degree 0 on ( P-1, p(1),..., p(2g+1)). The purpose of this note is to show that N is isomorphic to the variety of (g - 2)-dimensional linear subspaces of P-2g contained in the intersection of two quadrics.

The periodic results extend the work of Li and Vaaler (Indiana Univ Math J 48(1):183-236, 1999), who considered this problem for the sawtooth function with respect to Jacobi measures. Our techniques are based on the theory of reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (of entire functions and of polynomials) and on the construction of suitable interpolations with nodes at the zeros of Laguerre-Plya functions.

This shows that the non-faithfulness of a quantum representation implies that the corresponding quantum invariant fails to detect the unknot. The proof utilizes the Dehornoy ordering of the braid groups.

Double EPW-sextics are parametrized by Lagrangian subspaces of the third wedge-product of a 6-dimensional complex vector space. We prove that Lagrangians in the indeterminacy locus of the period map contain a decomposable -vector enjoying very special properties. In addition we prove a result about periods of double EPW-sextics which are either smooth or have isolated singular points with projectivized tangent cone isomorphic to the incidence variety in P-2 x (P-2).

The magnetic Laplacian in this case can be identified with the twisted Laplacian on and our approach is via spectral theory. The local existence is established in certain first order Sobolev space, naturally associated to the twisted Laplacian, the energy space. The global well posedness is then deduced via a blowup analysis, with the help of the mass and the energy conservation established here. The general class of nonlinearities considered includes in particular, the power type nonlinearities, focussing as well as defocussing cases. The results in this paper extends the local wellposedness established in Ratnakumar and Sohani (J Funct Anal 265(1):1-27, (2013).	[Ratnakumar, P.

Here, we introduce the notion of permeable derived equivalence and we prove that a permeable derived equivalence between two blocks of group algebras implies the existence of a derived equivalence between the corresponding blocks of cohomological Mackey algebras. In particular, in the context of Brou,'s abelian defect group conjecture, if two blocks are splendidly derived equivalent, then the corresponding blocks of cohomological Mackey algebras are derived equivalent.

J	Hochenegger, A; Martinengo, E				Hochenegger, Andreas; Martinengo, Elena			Mori dream stacks	MATHEMATISCHE ZEITSCHRIFT			English	Article							DELIGNE-MUMFORD STACKS; MODULI SPACES; COX RINGS; COMBINATORICS; COVERS	We propose a generalisation of Mori dream spaces to stacks. We show that this notion is preserved under root constructions and taking abelian gerbes. Unlike the case of Mori dream spaces, such a stack is not always given as a quotient of the spectrum of its Cox ring by the Picard group. We give a criterion when this is true in terms of Mori dream spaces and root constructions. Finally, we compare this notion with that of smooth toric Deligne-Mumford stacks.			ahochene@math.uni-koeln.de; martinengo@math.uni-hannover.de	Hochenegger, Andreas/E-5332-2017	Hochenegger, Andreas/0000-0001-9523-443X				25	3	3	0	0	SPRINGER HEIDELBERG	HEIDELBERG	TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY	0025-5874	1432-1823		MATH Z	Math.

Assuming that B has a (a, b) subset of R gap in the essential spectrum, we prove a minimax principle for eigenvalues of B in (a,b) using a suitable orthogonal decomposition of the form domain of Q. This allows us to justify two minimax characterisations of eigenvalues in the gap of three-dimensional Dirac operators with potentials which may have a strong Coulomb singularity.

This is a generalization of a result by Shalika, that concerned the group case. Shalika's result was crucial in the proof of his multiplicity one theorem.

On the other hand, those for which the forward and backward Gauss maps are local diffeomorphisms. Besides, we prove that for this kind of foliations, are global diffeomorphisms onto their images.

J	Hedenmalm, H				Hedenmalm, Haakan			On the uniqueness theorem of Holmgren	MATHEMATISCHE ZEITSCHRIFT			English	Article						Cauchy problem; Dirichlet problem; Holmgren's uniqueness theorem		We review the classical Cauchy-Kovalevskaya theorem and the related uniqueness theorem of Holmgren, in the simple setting of powers of the Laplacian and a smooth curve segment in the plane. As a local problem, the Cauchy-Kovalevskaya and Holmgren theorems supply a complete answer to the existence and uniqueness issues. Here, we consider a global uniqueness problem of Holmgren's type. Perhaps surprisingly, we obtain a connection with the theory of quadrature identities, which demonstrates that rather subtle algebraic properties of the curve come into play. For instance, if is the interior domain of an ellipse, and I is a proper arc of the ellipse , then there exists a nontrivial biharmonic function u in which is three-flat on I (i.e., all partial derivatives of u of order vanish on I) if and only if the ellipse is a circle. Another instance of the same phenomenon is that if is bounded and simply connected with -smooth Jordan curve boundary, and if the arc is nowhere real-analytic, then we have local uniqueness already with sub-Cauchy data: if a function is biharmonic in for some planar neighborhood of I, and is three-flat on I, then it vanishes identically on , provided that is connected. Finally, we consider a three-dimensional setting, and analyze it partially using analogues of the square of the standard Cauchy-Riemann operator. In a special case when the domain is of periodized cylindrical type, we find a connection with the massive Laplacian [the Helmholz operator with imaginary wave number] and the theory of generalized analytic (or pseudoanalytic) functions of Bers and Vekua.

We show that the (algebraic) quotient given by the possibly not finitely generated ring of invariants is "almost" an algebraic variety, and that the quotient morphism has a number of nice properties. One of the main difficulties comes from the fact that the quotient morphism is not necessarily surjective. These general results are then refined for actions of the additive group , where we can say much more. We get a rather explicit description of the so-called plinth variety and of the separating variety, which measures how much orbits are separated by invariants. The most complete results are obtained for representations. We also give a complete and detailed analysis of Roberts' famous example of a an action of on 7-dimensional affine space with a non-finitely generated ring of invariants.

Fixed points for nilpotent actions on the plane and the Cartwright-Littlewood theorem	MATHEMATISCHE ZEITSCHRIFT			English	Article						Fixed point; Recurrence; Nilpotent group; Homeomorphism; Invariant continuum; Winding number	HOMEOMORPHISMS	The goal of this paper is proving the existence and then localizing global fixed points for nilpotent groups generated by homeomorphisms of the plane satisfying a certain Lipschitz condition and having a bounded orbit. The Lipschitz condition is inspired in a classical result of Bonatti for commuting diffeomorphisms of the -sphere and in particular it is satisfied by diffeomorphisms, not necessarily of class , whose linear part at every point is uniformly close to the identity. In this same setting we prove a version of the Cartwright-Littlewood theorem, obtaining fixed points in any full continuum preserved by a nilpotent action.

We compare this equivalence to a Quillen equivalence in the opposite direction previously established by Lurie. From our results we deduce that a categorical equivalence of simplicial sets induces a Quillen equivalence on the corresponding over-categories, equipped with the covariant model structures. Also, we show that a version of Quillen's Theorem A for -categories easily follows.

By the Morita-Tachikawa Theorem this implies that is related to a certain class of pairs consisting of an (another) algebra and a module satisfying the double centralizer condition. In this paper we determine the class , and show the connection between the partial order of a 1-quasi-hereditary algebra and the structure of the related pair in (see Theorem A). If the first component of a pair in is a commutative algebra, then the corresponding algebra in receives additional features described in Theorem B. Finally we introduce the Ringel dual for objects in . Of particular interest are those pairs in which occur as Ringel dual (see Theorem C).

Our approach is based on the relation with linear difference operators. We define supersymmetric analogs of linear difference operators called Hill's operators. The space of these "superfriezes" is an algebraic supervariety, isomorphic to the space of supersymmetric second order difference equations, called Hill's equations.

In particular, we complement previous studies on this subject by exhibiting dense or closed infinite dimensional linear subspaces of analytic functions in a simply connected domain of the complex plane, containing the origin, whose all non zero elements are made of Pad, universal series. We also show how Pad, universal series can be built from classical universal series with large Ostrowski-gaps.

Hecke stability and weight modular forms	MATHEMATISCHE ZEITSCHRIFT			English	Article						Modular forms; Computational number theory; Galois representations; Inverse Galois theory; Isogeny graphs	NUMBER-FIELDS; GALOIS; COHOMOLOGY	The Galois representations associated to weight 1 eigenforms over are remarkable in that they are unramified at , but the effective computation of these modular forms presents challenges. One complication in this setting is that a weight 1 cusp form over need not arise from reducing a weight 1 cusp form over . In this article we propose a unified Hecke stability method for computing spaces of weight 1 modular forms of a given level in all characteristics simultaneously. Our main theorems outline conditions under which a finite-dimensional Hecke module of ratios of modular forms must consist of genuine modular forms. We conclude with some applications of the Hecke stability method that are motivated by the refined inverse Galois problem.

Namely, we construct a closed hypersurface and a sequence of Hamiltonians C degrees-converging to zero such that the hypersurface and its images have no leafwise intersections, showing that some form of the contact type condition on the hypersurface is necessary in several persistence results. In connection with recent results in continuous symplectic topology, we also show that C degrees-convergence of hypersurfaces, Hamiltonian diffeomorphic to each other, does not in general force C degrees-convergence of the characteristic foliations.

Alexander to a class of balanced domains in . Specifically: we prove that any proper holomorphic self-map of a certain type of balanced, finite-type domain in , is an automorphism. The main novelty of our proof is the use of a recent result of Opshtein on the behaviour of the iterates of holomorphic self-maps of a certain class of domains. We use Opshtein's theorem, together with the tools made available by finiteness of type, to deduce that the aforementioned map is unbranched. The monodromy theorem then delivers the result.

Recently, Herschend, Iyama and Oppermann introduced the notions of -representation infinite algebra and -regular module, extending the above notions to finite dimensional algebras of global dimension . Since the Beilinson algebras of AS-regular algebras of dimension are typical examples of -representation infinite algebras, the purpose of this paper is to study the behavior of -regular modules over such algebras. In particular, we will show that the isomorphism classes of simple 2-regular modules over a 2-representation tame quantum Beilinson algebra of Type are parameterized by .

Vacillating Hecke tableaux and linked partitions	MATHEMATISCHE ZEITSCHRIFT			English	Article						Vacillating Hecke tableau; Hecke diagram; Rook strip; The Hecke insertion algorithm; Linked partition; Crossing number; Nesting number	FILLINGS; CROSSINGS; SEQUENCES; DIAGRAMS; NESTINGS; GRAPHS	We introduce the structure of vacillating Hecke tableaux. By using the Hecke insertion algorithm developed by Buch, Kresch, Shimozono, Tamvakis and Yong, we establish a one-to-one correspondence between vacillating Hecke tableaux and linked partitions, which arise in free probability theory. We define a Hecke diagram as a Young diagram possibly with a marked corner. A vacillating Hecke tableau is defined as a sequence of Hecke diagrams subject to a certain condition on addition and deletion of rook strips. The notion of a rook strip was introduced by Buch in the study of the Littlewood-Richardson rule for stable Grothendieck polynomials. We show that the crossing number and the nesting number of a linked partition can be determined by the maximal number of rows and the maximal number of columns of diagrams in the corresponding vacillating Hecke tableau. The proof relies on a theorem due to Thomas and Yong. As consequences, we confirm two conjectures on the distribution of the crossing number and the nesting number over linked partitions and ordinary partitions, respectively proposed by de Mier and Kim.

J	Jiang, Y				Jiang, Yi			Topology of certain symplectic conifold transitions of -bundles	MATHEMATISCHE ZEITSCHRIFT			English	Article						Symplectic conifold transitions; CP1-bundles; Kahler three-folds; Characteristic classes		In this paper, we first extend Smith, Thomas and Yau's examples of certain symplectic conifold transitions on trivial -bundles over K ahler surfaces to all -bundles over symplectic 4-manifolds. Then we determine the diffeomorphism types of all these symplectic conifold transitions. In particular, this implies that in the case of trivial -bundles over projective complex surfaces, Smith, Thomas and Yau's examples of symplectic conifold transitions are diffeomorphic to Kahler three-folds.

As a consequence, we may generalize the Sasaki-Futaki invariant to K-contact geometry and establish a number of elementary properties. Moreover, we prove that in dimension 5 certain deformation-theoretic results can be established also under weaker integrability conditions by exploiting the relationship between J-anti-invariant and self-dual 2-forms.

We say that a hermitian metric on with positive curvature is a Kahler-Ricci soliton if it satisfies the equation for some holomorphic vector field . The candidate for a vector field is uniquely determined by the holomorphic structure of X up to conjugacy, hence depends only on the holomorphic structure of X. We introduce a sequence of holomorphic vector fields which approximates and fits to the quantized settings. Moreover, we also discuss about the existence and convergence of the quantized Kahler-Ricci solitons attached to the sequence .

It follows from the work of Merel, Momose and David that there is a constant B-K,B-S so that if E is an elliptic curve defined over K, semistable outside S, then for all p > B-K,B-S, the representation (rho) over bar (E, p) is irreducible. We combine this with modularity and level lowering to showthe existence of an effectively computable constantC(K, S), and an effectively computable set of elliptic curves over K with CM E1, ... , E-n such that the following holds. If E is an elliptic curve over K semistable outside S, and p > C-K,C- S is prime, then either (rho) over bar (E, p) is surjective, or (rho) over bar (E, p) similar to (rho) over bar I-E(, p) for some i = 1, ... ,n.

Naive blowups and canonical birationally commutative factors	MATHEMATISCHE ZEITSCHRIFT			English	Article						Point space; Noncommutative Hilbert scheme; Canonical birationally Commutative factor; Naive blowup algebra	PROJECTIVE SURFACES; ALGEBRAS; DIMENSION; RINGS	In 2008, Rogalski and Zhang showed that if R is a strongly noetherian connected graded algebra over an algebraically closed field k, then R has a canonical birationally commutative factor. This factor is, up to finite dimension, a twisted homogeneous coordinate ring B( X, L, sigma); here X is the projective parameter scheme for point modules over R, as well as tails of points in Qgr-R. (As usual, s is an automorphism of X, and L is a sigma-ample invertible sheaf on X). We extend this result to a large class of noetherian (but not strongly noetherian) algebras. Specifically, let R be a noetherian connected graded k-algebra, where k is an uncountable algebraically closed field. Let Y infinity denote the parameter space (or stack or proscheme) parameterizing R-point modules, and suppose there is a projective variety X that corepresents tails of points. There is a canonical map p: Y infinity. X. If the indeterminacy locus of p(-1) is 0-dimensional and X satisfies a mild technical assumption, we show that there is a homomorphism g: R -> B( X, L,sigma), and that g(R) is, up to finite dimension, a naive blowup on X in the sense of Keeler et al.

Group localization and two problems of Levine	MATHEMATISCHE ZEITSCHRIFT			English	Article							ALGEBRAIC CLOSURE; FUNDAMENTAL GROUP; LINK CONCORDANCE; HOMOLOGY	A. K. Bousfield's -localization of groups inverts homologically two-connected homomorphisms of groups. J. P. Levine's algebraic closure of groups inverts homomorphisms between finitely generated and finitely presented groups which are homologically two-connected and for which the image normally generates. We resolve an old problem concerning Bousfield -localization of groups, and answer two questions of Levine regarding algebraic closure of groups. In particular, we show that the kernel of the natural homomorphism from a group to its Bousfield -localization is not always a -perfect subgroup. In the case of algebraic closure of groups, we prove the analogous result that this kernel is not always a union of invisible subgroups.

Assuming Vojta's conjecture, we prove a sufficient condition for morphisms on so that -integral points in each orbit are Zariski-non-dense. This condition is geometric, and for dimension 1 it corresponds precisely to Silverman's hypothesis that the second iterate of the map is not a polynomial. In fact, we will prove a more precise formulation comparing local heights outside to the global height. For hyperplanes, this amounts to comparing logarithmic sizes of the coordinates, generalizing Silverman's precise version in dimension 1. We also discuss a variant where we can conclude that integral points in orbits are finite, rather than just Zariski-non-dense. Further, we show unconditional results and examples, using Schmidt's subspace theorem and known cases of Lang-Vojta conjecture. We end with some extensions to the case of rational maps and to the case when the arithmetic of the orbit under one map is controlled by the geometric properties of another. We include many explicit examples to illustrate different behaviors of integral points in orbits in higher dimensions.
