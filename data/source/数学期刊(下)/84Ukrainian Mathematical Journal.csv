CLASSIFICATION OF FINITE COMMUTATIVE SEMIGROUPS FOR WHICH THE INVERSE MONOID OF LOCAL AUTOMORPHISMS IS A Delta-SEMIGROUP	UKRAINIAN MATHEMATICAL JOURNAL			English	Article							CONGRUENCES FORM; CHAIN	A semigroup S is called a Delta-semigroup if the lattice of its congruences forms a chain relative to the inclusion. A local automorphism of the semigroup S is called an isomorphism between its two subsemigroups. The set of all local automorphisms of the semigroup S relative to the ordinary operation of composition of binary relations forms an inverse monoid of local automorphisms. We present a classification of finite commutative semigroups for which the inverse monoid of local automorphisms is a Delta-semigroup.	[Derech, V.

THE FIRST PASSAGE TIME AND ESTIMATION OF THE NUMBER OF LEVEL-CROSSINGS FOR A TELEGRAPH PROCESS	UKRAINIAN MATHEMATICAL JOURNAL			English	Article								It is a well-known result that almost all sample paths of a Brownian motion or Wiener process {W(t)} have infinitely many zero-crossings in the interval (0, delta) for delta > 0. Under the Kac condition, the telegraph process weakly converges to the Wiener process. We estimate the number of intersections of a level or the number of level-crossings for the telegraph process. Passing to the limit under the Kac condition, we also obtain an estimate of the level-crossings for the Wiener process.	[Pogorui, A.

On the Limit Behavior of a Sequence of Markov Processes Perturbed in a Neighborhood of the Singular Point	UKRAINIAN MATHEMATICAL JOURNAL			English	Article							BROWNIAN-MOTION; GRAPHS; CONE	We study the limit behavior of a sequence of Markov processes whose distributions outside any neighborhood of a "singular" point are attracted to a certain probability law. In any neighborhood of this point, the limit behavior can be irregular. As an example of application of the general result, we consider a symmetric random walk with unit jumps perturbed in the neighborhood of the origin. The invariance principle is established for the standard time and space scaling. The limit process is a skew Brownian motion.	[Pilipenko, A.

Differential Equations with Bistable Nonlinearity	UKRAINIAN MATHEMATICAL JOURNAL			English	Article							STATIONARY SOLUTIONS; PROPAGATING FRONTS; PERIODIC-SOLUTIONS; DIFFUSION; CHAOS	We study bounded solutions of differential equations with bistable nonlinearity by numerical and analytic methods. A simple mechanical model of circular pendulum with magnetic suspension in the upper equilibrium position is regarded as a bistable dynamical system simulating a supersensitive seismograph. We consider autonomous differential equations of the second and fourth orders with discontinuous piecewise linear and cubic nonlinearities. Bounded solutions with finitely many zeros, including solitonlike solutions with two zeros and kinklike solutions with several zeros are studied in detail. It is shown that, to within the sign and translation, the bounded solutions of the analyzed equations are uniquely determined by the integer numbers n - [d/l] where is a constant characterizing the intensity of nonlinearity. The existence of bounded chaotic solutions is established and the exact value of space entropy is found for periodic solutions.	[Samoilenko, A. M.; Nizhnik, I.

The relationship is established between the well-posed solvability of the nonlocal boundary-value problem for a system of hyperbolic equations with impulsive effects and the well-posed solvability of a family of two-point boundary-value problems for a system of ordinary differential equations with impulsive effects. Sufficient conditions for the existence of a unique solution of the family of two-point boundary-value problems for a system of ordinary differential equations with impulsive effects are obtained by method of introduction of functional parameters. The algorithms are proposed for finding the solutions.

On the Radius of Injectivity for Generalized Quasiisometries in the Spaces of Dimension Higher Than Two	UKRAINIAN MATHEMATICAL JOURNAL			English	Article							MAPPINGS	We consider a class of local homeomorphisms more general than the mappings with bounded distortion. Under these homeomorphisms, the growth of the p-module (n-1 < p a parts per thousand currency sign n) of the families of curves is controlled by an integral containing an admissible metric and a measurable function Q. It is shown that, under generic conditions imposed on the majorant Q, this class has a positive radius of injectivity (and, hence, a ball in which every mapping is homeomorphic). Moreover, one of the conditions imposed on Q is not only sufficient but also necessary for existence of a radius of injectivity.	[Gol'berg, A. L.] Holon Inst Technol, Holon, Israel; [Sevost'yanov, E.

Problem of Optimal Control for a Semilinear Hyperbolic System of Equations of the First Order with Infinite Horizon Planning	UKRAINIAN MATHEMATICAL JOURNAL			English	Article								We establish necessary conditions for the optimality of smooth boundary and initial controls in a semilinear hyperbolic system of the first order. The problem adjoint to the original problem is a semilinear hyperbolic system without initial conditions. The suggested approach is based on the use of special variations of continuously differentiable controls. The existence of global generalized solutions for a semilinear first-order hyperbolic system in a domain unbounded in time is proved. The proof is based on the use of the Banach fixed-point theorem and a space metric with weight functions.	[Derev'yanko, T. O.; Kyrylych, V.

The complete system of invariants for braids is well known. This system is known as the system of Vasil'ev invariants and distinguishes braids to within a homotopy. We consider braids formed by the trajectories Z (k) (t) = X (k) (t) + iY (k) (t) such that X (k) , Y (k) , 1 a parts per thousand currency sign k a parts per thousand currency sign n, are continuous semimartingales with respect to a common filtration.

Admissibility of Estimated Regression Coefficients Under Generalized Balanced Loss	UKRAINIAN MATHEMATICAL JOURNAL			English	Article							LINEAR-MODELS; RESPECT	There are some discussions concerning the admissibility of estimated regression coefficients under the balanced loss function in the general linear model. We study this issue for the generalized linear regression model. First, we propose a generalized weighted balance loss function for the generalized linear model. For the proposed loss function, we study sufficient and necessary conditions for the admissibility of the estimated regression coefficients in two interesting linear estimation classes.

The structure and properties of these rings are studied and the relationships between prime center rings, strongly regular rings, and WPC rings are discussed, parallel with the relationship between the WPC and commutativity.

Asymptotic Solutions of the Dirichlet Problem for the Heat Equation at a Characteristic Point	UKRAINIAN MATHEMATICAL JOURNAL			English	Article								The Dirichlet problem for the heat equation in a bounded domain aS, a"e (n+1) is characteristic because there are boundary points at which the boundary touches a characteristic hyperplane t = c, where c is a constant. For the first time, necessary and sufficient conditions on the boundary guaranteeing that the solution is continuous up to the characteristic point were established by Petrovskii (1934) under the assumption that the Dirichlet data are continuous. The appearance of Petrovskii's paper was stimulated by the existing interest to the investigation of general boundary-value problems for parabolic equations in bounded domains. We contribute to the study of this problem by finding a formal solution of the Dirichlet problem for the heat equation in a neighborhood of a cuspidal characteristic boundary point and analyzing its asymptotic behavior.

The limit behavior of this operator sequence is investigated in a function space (in a sense of pointwise and uniform convergence). We consider a nonhyperbolic case in which not all plane maps specifying the operator in the function space are contractive and propose sufficient conditions for the convergence of approximations and estimates of the errors for this kind of approximation (similar to the collage theorem for fractal approximation).

An exponentially convergent algorithm for the numerical solution of this problem is proposed and justified under the assumption that the operator coefficient A is strongly positive and certain existence and uniqueness conditions are satisfied. The algorithm is based on the representations of operator functions via the Dunford-Cauchy integral along a hyperbola covering the spectrum of A and the quadrature formula containing a small number of resolvents. The efficiency of the proposed algorithm is illustrated by several examples.	[Vasylyk, V. B.; Makarov, V.

Fractional Calculus of a Unified Mittag-Leffler Function	UKRAINIAN MATHEMATICAL JOURNAL			English	Article								The main aim of the paper is to introduce an operator in the space of Lebesgue measurable real or complex functions L(a, b). Some properties of the Riemann-Liouville fractional integrals and differential operators associated with the function E (alpha,beta,lambda,mu,rho,p) (gamma,delta) (cz; s, r) are studied and the integral representations are obtained. Some properties of a special case of this function are also studied by the means of fractional calculus.	[Prajapati, J. C.] Charotar Univ Sci & Technol, Changa, India; [Nathwani, B.
