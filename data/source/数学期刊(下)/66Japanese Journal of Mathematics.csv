Characters of (relatively) integrable modules over affine Lie superalgebras	JAPANESE JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICS			English	Article						basic Lie superalgebra; defect; dual Coxeter number; affine Lie superalgebra; odd reflection; integrable highest weight module over basic and affine Lie superalgebra; maximally atypical module; KW-condition; Enright functor; relatively integrable module; character formula	WEYL DENOMINATOR IDENTITY; DUAL COXETER NUMBER; HIGHEST WEIGHT; REPRESENTATIONS; ALGEBRAS; FORMULAS	In the paper we consider the problem of computation of characters of relatively integrable irreducible highest weight modules L over finite-dimensional basic Lie superalgebras and over affine Lie superalgebras . The problem consists of two parts. First, it is the reduction of the problem to the -module F(L), where is the associated to L integral Lie superalgebra and F(L) is an integrable irreducible highest weight -module. Second, it is the computation of characters of integrable highest weight modules. There is a general conjecture concerning the first part, which we check in many cases. As for the second part, we prove in many cases the KW-character formula, provided that the KW-condition holds, including almost all finite-dimensional -modules when is basic, and all maximally atypical non-critical integrable -modules when is affine with non-zero dual Coxeter number.

Mackey's first contribution is a detailed version of the so-called Gelfand criterion for weakly symmetric Gelfand pairs. Mackey's second contribution is a characterization of simply reducible groups (a notion introduced by Wigner). The other result is a twisted version of the Frobenius-Schur theorem, where "twisted" refers to the above-mentioned involutory anti-automorphism.

We also discuss their applications, particularly to questions about surgery, homology cobordism, and four-manifolds with boundary. We then describe Floer stable homotopy types, the related Pin(2)-equivariant Seiberg-Witten Floer homology, and its application to the triangulation conjecture.

Ceccherini-Silberstein, F. Scarabotti and F. Tolli [8]. We pay close attention on a special condition related to Gelfand pairs. Namely, we call a finite group G and its automorphism satisfy Condition () if the following condition is satisfied: if for , and are conjugate in G, then they are conjugate in . The main purpose of the note was to study the meanings of this condition, as well as showing many examples of G and which do (or do not) satisfy Condition (star).

It is for my Takagi Lectures at RIMS in November of 2013. In this paper, I first discuss the Futaki invariants, the K-stability and its relation to the K-energy. Next I will outline my work in 2012 on the existence of Kahler-Einstein metrics on K-stable Fano manifolds. Finally, I will present S. Paul's work on stability of pairs with some modifications of mine.
