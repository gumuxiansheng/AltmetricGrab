We measured the orientation of a total of 167 churches built prior to A.D. 1086. A comprehensive statistical analysis of the sample indicates a decisive orientation pattern, with a clear tendency to orientate according to the standard tradition, albeit with certain particularities. Three sub-samples are examined to find the tendencies at each different historical time. This exercise indicates that the main group of orientations seem to relate to the Canonical equinox on 25 March, while popular 'expected' orientations, such as that of the rising sun on the day of the patron saint of the church, are completely absent. Other groups of orientations are specific to each period, such as that towards sunrise on Saint James's day, important only after the discovery of the saint's tomb in the ninth century.

After a short excursus of the most famous historical and contemporary applications, we propose several possible approaches for managing the geometry of anamorphic curves both in the field of descriptive geometry (by using interactive tools such as CabrAnot sign and GeoGebra) and during the complex surfaces realization process, from concept design to manufacture, through CNC systems (by adopting generative procedural algorithms elaborated in Grasshopper).

To achieve this, the spatial characteristics of three historic TCPGs are first mathematically derived using connectivity analysis, a variation of a space syntax technique. The data developed through this process is then used to shape the rules of a parametric system to generate new garden plans with similar spatial connectivity values and structures. While these new plans capture some of the socio-spatial features of the TCPG, the other important characteristic of these gardens is a particular level of visual complexity. Using fractal analysis, the characteristic visual complexity of the newly generated garden plans is then compared with the historic cases, to assess the success of the system in aesthetic terms. Through this three-stage process (syntactical derivation, parametric generation and fractal analysis) the paper demonstrates a method for capturing selected spatial and aesthetic properties in a parametric system and also provides new tools for landscape design in the context of specific historical sites and approaches.

However, if the object is designed according to the laws of optical geometry, in a way that its mirror image is conceived in advance, then this is anamorphosis. The objective of the present study is to emphasise the potential of cylindrical mirror anamorphosis, in the context of change in the urban-architectural ambience. In this respect it is necessary to obtain a constructive, geometrically correct solution of the 3D model of cylindrical-mirror anamorphosis, whereby the mirror surface is a vertical rotating cylinder. This topic is the primary focus of the present research. In addition, the conditions for change in the anamorphic form were analysed, and its possible functions in architecture were identified. Various examples of existing buildings with cylindrical mirror elements, in respect of which it was possible to construct and apply these types of anamorphoses, were used. The method of constructive perspective and the laws of optical geometry were applied. Analyses were made on the basis of experiments and using AutoCAD 3D methods to analyse the mirror anamorphosis of a cube and octahedron.

The generative design system comprises two subsystems that permit the generation and the evaluation of customised designs within a predefined design language. The shape generation subsystem is defined by shape grammars and parametric design models. The shape evaluation subsystem encompasses simulation and optimisation to guarantee the structural feasibility of the customised designs under operating conditions. This paper focuses on the modelling activities regarding the constitution of the optimisation part of the shape evaluation subsystem. Structural optimisation using simulated annealing is applied to assist the designer in the automatic search for an optimal grammar-based detailed solution. The theoretical model is illustrated by its application to a symbolic mass production problem: Thonet bentwood chairs, which were changed to comply with the mass customisation paradigm.

J	Batty, M				Batty, Michael			Competition in the Built Environment: Scaling Laws for Cities, Neighbourhoods and Buildings	NEXUS NETWORK JOURNAL			English	Article						Scaling; Power laws; Random growth; City populations; Rank size; Building heights	POWER LAWS	Built environments at any spatial scale are represented as sets of like objects-cities, neighbourhoods, buildings but also components such as streets, parks, etc.,-which are distributed spatially according to certain rules that we are only just beginning to detect and measure. Unlike normally distributed attributes of the population, these urban elements often scale according to forces that determine large numbers of small elements and a small number of large ones. While many objects evolve from small to large, not all objects can be large as resources as well as physical limits determine the distribution of their sizes. The theory behind such size distributions is referred to as scaling and the shape of such distributions is quite well-defined by various power and exponential laws. As objects grow and evolve, or are even designed, their form changes qualitatively due to the forces of competition and the constraints on space. Here we explore these ideas for cities, neighbourhoods in towns, and buildings, specifically high buildings, revealing that there are both important differences as well as similarities in their form, function, and structure.

Two types are distinguished: the 'ring doughnut' where the central circle is a courtyard, and the 'jam doughnut' where some important central space (the 'jam') is surrounded by a ring of smaller spaces (the 'dough'). The main emphasis is on the second type. A series of historical examples is discussed including locomotive roundhouses, Panopticon prisons, hospital wards, parking garages and offices. The ratio of the diameters of the circles is shown to be important for the functioning and even the feasibility of 'jam doughnut' plans, depending on the activity housed. In several of the case studies the doughnut shape results in serious inefficiencies in the use of space. Such plan types were soon abandoned. Geometrical data on all the examples are presented in a 'morphospace' or world of possible doughnut plans.

By building oval churches covered with oval domes, Jacopo Barozzi da Vignola (1507-1573) introduced a new pattern into the architectural shape grammar. The geometry of the oval figure gracefully combines the theoretical concept of cosmic centrality and the pragmatic necessities of liturgical linearity. However it raises a number of design problems for which architects devised various and inventive solutions. The comparison of various churches dating back to no later than the end of the Seicento, highlights the diversity of all the projects. Although every church is unique in its layout, design, features and decoration, all oval churches propose similar challenges to their designer, the most important of which are the choice of the geometrical pattern, the dome, and the fa double dagger ade.

Extending the Algebras of Design	NEXUS NETWORK JOURNAL			English	Article						Shape algebras; Shape grammars; Design representation	SHAPE	Algebras of design have previously been investigated for shapes composed of rectilinear geometric elements, such as lines and planes, and the properties of these algebras have been found to be beneficial for formalising designs, as well as the visual processes used by designers as they manipulate shapes in their design explorations. In this paper, an overview is presented of the application of these algebras in formalising design processes, and this is followed by a discussion concerning issues that arise when the algebras are extended to accommodate non-rectilinear designs, represented by shapes composed of curves, surfaces and solids. Consideration of non-rectilinear shapes introduces new problems not previously identified in the established formalism, resulting from the geometries and topologies of the shapes. These give rise to significant questions about the relationships between shapes and the property of embedding, which is fundamental to the construction of algebras of design.

This present text argues that the volume can credibly be attributed, not to Francesca Colonna as is often done, but to the Renaissance humanist and polymath Leon Battista Alberti. Evidence for this is found in the unravelling of arithmogrammatical evidence sprinkled throughout the work, similar to those found in other of Alberti's works.

This formulation permits use of an algorithm to check the completeness of the list of the structures produced by the artist. Our conclusion is that the artist found the correct number of structures (that is, 122), but that his list contains a mistake in the presentation of a pair of incomplete cubes, a discovery that appears not to have been noted before.

His relationship with FIAT grew over time and led him to assume increasingly important assignments. Among these were the social architectures that he designed for the company during the 1930s. The most representative were the two hotel towers in SestriSre and the colonies of Marina di Massa in Tuscany and Sauze d'Oulx in Piedmont; here he tested and consolidated his innovative architectural type of the cylindrical tower, where the helix represents the geometric matrix and the compositional key of the whole structure.

Here we trace the history of these investigations, and place them in the context of their manifestations in architecture, whether real or imagined. As we take a look at the social milieu within which the study of the fourth dimension flourished, in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, we investigate the biographies and works of the protagonists, and note that the study of the fourth dimension, and dimensionality itself, was strongly coloured by considerations of ethics and even religiosity. Finally we look at a few examples of architecture which offer different interpretations of the fourth dimension.

The analysis is done with the utmost respect for ancient sources, and in particular for Egyptian mathematical knowledge. In a first general analysis, the different parts that make up the chapel are analysed in terms of both volume and surface. Later, the most representative elements, the hypostyle hall and sanctuary are studied in greater detail. Here, we encounter geometric shapes that are very close to the ratios ae2, 2/ae3 and ae2/ae3, which are derived from simple geometric shapes such as squares, rectangles ae2 and equilateral triangles. Ancient Egyptians could achieve their approximations by unit fractions in accordance with the Egyptian system of numerical notation. Finally, with the data obtained, the study proposes a hypothesis about the possible design method of the funeral chapel.

Like many of Sinan's designs it has been the subject of detailed analysis in the past, with historians offering theories to explain its visual properties and how they differ from those of his previous works. However, such theories have remained largely untested because of the difficulty of quantitatively analysing the building's intricate formal, ornamental and material properties. The present paper uses computational fractal analysis to overcome this problem. This method, as it is applied in the paper, derives a non-integer measure of the characteristic complexity of three hierarchical layers in visual information in the facades of the KA +/- lA +/-double dagger Ali PaAYa Mosque. Through this process the paper not only provides important quantitative results which can be used to test past theories about the building, but these new measures are then compared with those that have previously been developed, using the same method, for Sinan's Suleymaniye Mosque.

The method is based on oriented multi-image spherical panoramas produced by stitching techniques. The photogrammetric process has two steps: the creation of a semi-automatic process to find homolog points in two panoramas; the creation of parametric definitions for an interactive modeling creating points, segments, and surfaces based on the plotted points in the first step. By connecting these two steps, the creation of the model will be automatic, as we indicate the necessary points in just one panoramic photo. The principals of multi-view geometry and epipolar geometry were applied to simplify the calculation in the first step in order to create an automatic identification of the correspondent points in the other panorama. The epipolar geometry is described by both analytical and graphical programming, implementing in the first case a C++ application and in the second case a Rhinoceros and Grasshopper application. A case study of the Ponte Rotto in Rome (Italy) is presented.

Planar pinwheels provide familiar schemes for layouts which present design 'in the round' with a cyclic symmetry. The paper examines the 3-D versions of 2-D pinwheels where a 'locked' joint with three rectangular volume elements aligned along orthogonal axes is a characteristic feature. Pairing handed versions of these locked joints yields a candidate for a 3-D pinwheel schema with six repeated volume elements and threefold cyclic symmetry. Shape rules, based on spatial relations between volumes, generate this and other examples of 3-D pinwheel schemas. These schemas are set in a wider analysis of the numbers and types of joints in 3-rectangulations in terms of maximal bounding planes. The bounding-plane views of the arrangements is set alongside more functional volume descriptions which enables the elements and relations in architectural form to be (re)generated and (re)interpreted both 'in view' and 'in use'.

The difference and similarity between the works in any series is achieved through repetitions and variations of certain relations between parts. This corresponds to creating a relational system and it requires having control over the underlying principles of that system much as basic design students are encouraged to do. In order to substantiate the implications of work such as Koman's in learning about design thinking, we first delineate the mathematical concepts in Koman's "embryonic" approach through visual schemas. These visual schemas are then supplied to first-year design students as guides and design constraints as well as tools to formalize their design thinking. We observe that introducing Koman's schemas to students helps them grasp how they establish relations between parts in their own design processes.

J	Knight, T				Knight, Terry			Shapes and Other Things	NEXUS NETWORK JOURNAL			English	Article						Algebra; Design theory; Shape grammars; Materials	GRAMMARS	Shape grammars have offered a unique computational theory of design over the past forty or so years. Although the focus of shape grammar theory has been on shapes and designs, the material objects or things that might comply with shapes have also been considered. In this paper, I trace the history of approaches for specifying material properties and things through shape grammars. I identify early trends and their limitations, and then propose a new possibility. In early approaches, material things were viewed through the lens of shapes. I argue for a new approach in which shapes are viewed through the lens of material things. Shape grammars are adapted to define making grammars for computing things. Shapes are just one of many things that can be made with these grammars. I conclude with a discussion of the relationship of designing and making, and suggest that designing is a kind of making.

Generating a Visual Language of Performance-Driven Configurations for the Principal Facade of a Prototype Sustainable House	NEXUS NETWORK JOURNAL			English	Article						Shape grammars; Symmetry; Patterns; Light simulation; Performance; Rule-based architecture		A performance-driven application of shape grammars is presented. A parametric shape grammar that generates a language of pattern designs for the principal fa double dagger ade of a prototype house-featuring a 5 x 20 matrix of electrochromic windows-based equally on performance and aesthetic criteria is described. The adjustment of the chromatism and light transmittance of each individual windowpane on the fa double dagger ade enables the adjustment of solar radiation at the house interior. The novel aspect of the grammar is that it encodes performance constraints of interior daylight illuminance and associates them to visual, symmetry principles of two-dimensional pattern generation. Twelve parametric rules account for the generation of the fa double dagger ade pattern language and five subclasses account for the symmetry of the patterns in the language.

J	Barrallo, J; Gonzalez-Quintial, F; Sanchez-Beitia, S				Barrallo, Javier; Gonzalez-Quintial, Francisco; Sanchez-Beitia, Santiago			An Introduction to the Vesica Piscis, the Reuleaux Triangle and Related Geometric Constructions in Modern Architecture	NEXUS NETWORK JOURNAL			English	Article						Vesica piscis; Reuleaux triangle; Circle intersection; Structural expressionism		The focus of this paper is the Vesica Piscis, a symbol made from the intersection of two circles of the same radius and where the centre of each circle lies on the circumference of the other. The origin of the Vesica Piscis is uncertain, but it can be found in different cultures throughout many historical periods. The Christian religion was most likely responsible for its spread, first as a fish symbol, then as an architectural niche surrounding sculptures and drawings of Christ, and finally as the Gothic pointed arch. A related geometric construction is the Reuleaux Triangle, which uses three intersected circumferences. In the second half of the twentieth century several architects rediscovered both types of geometrical constructions, producing variations of each. This paper commences with an overview of the history and construction of these geometric forms, and then analyses existing buildings which use them, before discussing different design strategies to develop new mathematical models based on ancient designs.

J	Hernandez, PB; Lopez, MV				Benitez Hernandez, Patricia; Valiente Lopez, Mercedes			The Tangent Solution to the Late Gothic Helical Staircase: A Justified Oblivion	NEXUS NETWORK JOURNAL			English	Article								In the late fifteenth century the helical staircase appeared in Spain as a representative element of late Gothic architecture. To gain a better understanding of this staircase and to carry out a proper preservation plan, it is essential to deepen our understanding of its construction and structure. This involves getting to know its geometrical configuration in depth, since its structural stability was ensured by rules of proportions. For this reason, this paper focuses on two broad types of staircases, classified according to the geometrical design strategy that solves the central aperture: the helical staircase by "radial solution" and by "tangent solution". The paper analyzes both solutions on the basis of objective criteria. In addition, it considers whether the limited use of some of these solutions was motivated by their particular geometry or was caused by other reasons is addressed. As result of this study it is demonstrated that although the two approaches solve the helical staircase in a similar way, the oblivion of the tangent approach was more objectively motivated.

J	Chiarella, M; Alvarado, RG				Chiarella, Mauro; Garcia Alvarado, Rodrigo			Folded Compositions in Architecture: Spatial Properties and Materials	NEXUS NETWORK JOURNAL			English	Article						Design analysis; Structural systems; Geometry; Transformations; Folded compositions; Form making		The two-dimensional unfolding of three-dimensional volumes allows architectural design and production methods to be rethought in a creative way. This paper reviews spatial and material properties of folded compositions in architecture, through a conceptual proposal based on professional and pedagogic experiences as well as new technologies for geometrical programming and digital fabrication, tested in five alternatives for one case study. The continuous and dynamic two-dimensional projection of a three-dimensional spatial situation provides a geometric relationship between the surface and volumetric configuration of a design, thus enabling a mathematical and operative connection between conditions of perception and production. The material expression of these configurations establishes a significant link between the conceptualisation of the design form, its geometric digital generation, its physical fabrication and overall appearance in a manner analogous to the design process used. The combination of folded compositions with the new technologies available further strengthens their potential, which embraces the fluid nature of human activity with continuous forms and delicately intricate geometries.

J	Dewitte, L				Dewitte, Liz			Proportionality in the Architecture of Dom Bellot	NEXUS NETWORK JOURNAL			English	Article								This paper explores the proportional system of the Benedictine monk and architect Dom Paul Bellot o.s.b. (Ordo Sancti Benedicti). A review of the geometrical study of the chapel of the former Augustinian College in Eindhoven (NL), built by Dom Bellot in 1922-1925 is presented. An analysis of the cross-section of this chapel shows the use of the Golden Section angle of almost 60A degrees in combination with triangular tracing. Dom Bellot used this set angle to construct harmonic geometry in an effort to create universal beauty and to divide greater parts into smaller parts in a harmonious way. Dom Bellot also used his Golden Section angle to build his diverse arches in the chapel.			lizdewitte@hotmail.nl						36	0	0	0	0	KIM WILLIAMS BOOKS	TORINO	CORSO REGINA MARGHERITA, 72, TORINO, 10153, ITALY	1590-5896	1522-4600		NEXUS NETW J	Nexus Netw.

J	Murtinho, V				Murtinho, Vitor			Leonardo's Vitruvian Man Drawing: A New Interpretation Looking at Leonardo's Geometric Constructions	NEXUS NETWORK JOURNAL			English	Article						Leonardo da Vinci; Vitruvian man; Vesica piscis; Golden number; Proportion		Generally speaking, today's scientific community considers that the famous figure drawn by Leonardo da Vinci at the end of the fifteenth century was made using the Golden ratio. More specifically, the relationship established between the circle's diameter and the side of the square is a consequence of the geometric relationship probably discovered by Euclid, but made famous by Luca Pacioli in his De Divina proportione. Aware of the close working relationship between Leonardo and Pacioli, namely in the writing of this last book, the theory that establishes a close relationship between these two figures, making use of this remarkable mathematical relationship, has gained credibility. In fact, the use of the Divina proporzione, despite being a very stimulating construction on an intellectual level, presents too great a margin of error, especially for such a competent geometrician as Leonardo da Vinci was. For that reason, the relationship between these two figures (square and circle) is grounded on a much simpler geometric relationship than the one found at the base of the definition, for instance, of Le Corbusier's Modulor.

J	Ozgenel, F; Sorguc, AG				Ozgenel, Firat; Sorguc, Arzu Gonenc			Proposal of a New Tool for 3D Pattern Generation	NEXUS NETWORK JOURNAL			English	Article								The behavior of sound in an enclosed space is very complex. This behavior is closely related to boundaries, material properties and with the form of the space they are in. In this paper, the image source method as a method for modeling the sound field in enclosed spaces is re-visited and patterns of image sources and their relationships with the geometry of enclosing space is studied by using polygons/polyhedrons in 2D and 3D. Symmetries of these image source points, identification of possible polygons enabling simple geometrical shape formations and knowing the resulting geometrical pattern, is used as an input to an acoustic model, reducing the complexity and computational time. Visualization of such complex patterns provides a solid tool to grasp complex relationships. Therefore transcoding the invisible relationships of acoustics into geometric patterns of mathematics provides a valuable means to improve the cognition of sound phenomena and to extract information as design input.

J	Parrinello, S; Bertacchi, S				Parrinello, Sandro; Bertacchi, Silvia			Geometric Proportioning in Sixteenth-Century Fortifications: The Design Proposals of Italian Military Engineer Giovanni Battista Antonelli	NEXUS NETWORK JOURNAL			English	Article								The geometry underlying the design of sixteenth-century fortifications is a subject of considerable interest among scholars of military architecture. Many treatises from the period emphasize the importance of using geometrical constructions for the design of defensive elements in proper proportion to the entire edifice. One treatise, the Epitomi delle fortificationi moderne, was written in 1560-1561 by Italian military engineer Giovanni Battista Antonelli (1527-1588), whose family had been in the service of the Spanish crown for nearly a century. In this paper, we investigate the methods set forth by Antonelli in his work, paying particular attention to the geometrical design of typical architectural elements in fortifications of the early modern period. We then provide a case study of the reconstruction of a bastion according to the engineer's proposals.

J	Rossi, M; Buratti, G				Rossi, Michela; Buratti, Giorgio			The Architecture of Color: Number and Shapes as Measurement and Representation Tools	NEXUS NETWORK JOURNAL			English	Article								The paper deals with the geometrical architecture of color models. Many of these models had practical application in industry and the arts. Historically, geometry has been the principal means to explain, measure and represent the phenomenon of color. A 2-year research project on color in industrial design and architecture has led to the development of a new digital model for design applications using generative software (Grasshopper). It aims to show the historical significance of mathematical relationships between color and shape, and the actual applicability of them to digital representation in a dynamic model. The research goal is the parametric modeling of a color solid whose surfaces can be adapted to several geodesic tessellations. A regular polyhedron projected onto the sphere allows the integration of different regular and semi-regular shapes, therefore the comparison of different sets of color with analogous symmetry. The developing process of the model stresses the symmetry of the three primary colors, referring to the RGB screen in the numbers that feature the changing of the hues on the solid's surface, however the number symmetry differs from the first shape.

J	Sorguc, AG				Sorguc, Arzu Gonenc			Dancing with Isometries in Architecture	NEXUS NETWORK JOURNAL			English	Article								This paper aims to emphasize the role of mathematics in computational design education. A computational design process that forces designers to design not only the end product but also the design process itself requires a mind shift to enable the designer to develop algorithms and skills to deal with complex relations. In this context, understanding rule-based systems, generative systems, parametric models and corresponding dimensionalities responding to the forces, variables, patterns, and the mathematics behind them, becomes crucial. Illustrating the reciprocal relationship between mathematics and architecture pattern studies offers great potentials. In this paper, a series of explorations have been presented. In this exploration dance acts as a medium of inquiry into how different complexities can be mapped, how rules can be generative (as first introduced in patterns) and how a set of rules can be transcoded into a complex domain.

J	Soyoz, U				Soyoz, Ufuk			Optical Measures: A Design Tool to Attain Truth or Illusion?	NEXUS NETWORK JOURNAL			English	Article								The optical measures have often been explained within the conceptual framework provided by Vitruvius: the "true" symmetries are distorted by space. Hence they have to be corrected by optical measures under the "real" conditions of appearance. While scholars have studied the phenomenon of optical measures within a narrowly mathematical framework, the aesthetic implications of Vitruvius' claim, his ambiguous use of the "truth" and "reality" has hardly been noticed. By situating the phenomenon of architectural proportions within the broader aesthetic discourse on Hellenistic art, this paper shall reveal the paradox of discourse between the optical knowledge and professional power of the architect. Rather than being a means to a quintessential truth or reality, the paper shall demonstrate how indeed optical measures were employed as a means to stylistic ends; that the change in the proportions of temple architecture from the Classical to the Hellenistic age predicates a painterly taste.

J	Zack, M				Zack, Maria			Rebuilding Mathematically: A Study of the Rebuilding of Lisbon and London	NEXUS NETWORK JOURNAL			English	Article								In 1666, the City of London burned to the ground in what has become known as the "Great Fire of London". In 1755, just 89 years later, Lisbon was destroyed by an earthquake. Throughout this time period Lisbon and London were joined by extensive commercial ties and there are several interesting parallels between the rebuilding of these two great cities. Both processes were led by individuals deeply committed to modernization and the use of the scientific method as a part of reconstruction. At the time of the 1666 London fire, calculus was being discovered in Europe and there were early attempts to create mathematical models for the properties of materials. By 1755, the elasticity of beams was reasonably well understood and some of the first seismically engineered structures were built in Lisbon. This paper examines some of the similarities and differences between how London and Lisbon were reconstructed and the role that mathematics and engineering played in their reconstruction.

This research considers style as an ordering principle. It proposes new tools for style analysis drawn from modern mathematics. A morphological approach is applied to four fa double dagger ades of North African Medersas buildings constructed between the fourteenth and sixteenth centuries. The results show that these facades share compositional similarities, and that their order and composition are governed by topological relationships. The application of graph theory and the use of computing tools make it possible to objectify the understanding of the style of the fa double dagger ade, and demonstrates how the representation of the fa double dagger ade in the form of a graph can reveal the structural topological arrangement as well as the ability to conduct calculations on the graph of the fa double dagger ade. The betweenness centrality measure reveals the existence of different interconnected levels of hierarchy, controlling the system of the facade.

J	Lopez-Mozo, A				Lopez-Mozo, Ana			On the Use of Perspective by Juan de Herrera, Architect of Philip II of Spain	NEXUS NETWORK JOURNAL			English	Article						Juan de Herrera; The Escorial; Hatfield drawing; Sixteenth century; Perspective drawing; Sebastiano Serlio; Daniele Barbaro; Giacomo Barozzi da Vignola		There are only two perspectives among the extant drawings of Juan de Herrera (1533-1597), who succeeded Juan Bautista de Toledo as architect of the Escorial. Both belong to the collection of engravings of that building made in 1589, after construction had already been completed. One is a bird's eye view showing the exterior of the building; the other is an interior perspective of the main altar. Although both drawings appear to be rigorous, the external perspective shows a cupola with an unrealistically high tambour, dome and lantern. This paper analyzes both of these, along with a third, a bird's eye view drawing of the building site by an unknown artist, conserved at Hatfield House (England), contextualizing them within the Escorial's construction process and Herrera's knowledge of perspective. The analysis argues that the elongated representation of the cupola was not an error caused by the difficulty of constructing a rigorous perspective or representing curve forms but was instead a deliberate choice made by the architect to make the cupola appear taller and slimmer.

J	March, L				March, Lionel			Pal(l)adian Arithmetic as Revealed in the Palazzo Della Torre, Verona	NEXUS NETWORK JOURNAL			English	Article						Andrea Palladio; Palazzo Della Torre; Mathematical means; Pythagorean arithmetic; Renaissance architecture; Doubling the cube; Leonardo da Vinci; Number theory		Room ratios in Palladio's design for the Palazzo Della Torre mostly ignore his own canonical recommendations and none of the rooms exemplify his rules for room heights. Proportionately, however, the scheme, in plan and elevation, is a brilliant celebration of the cube root, just three years after Cardano published the solution to the cubic equation using methods passed to him by Tartaglia. Daniele Barbaro, Tartaglia and Cardano were all known to each other, and it seems most likely that Palladio would have taken a personal interest in the matter. The cube root that underpins the proportional scheme is Delian, that is, the cube root of 2 cited in Vitruvius. Palladio derives other roots of 2 in anticipation of the arithmetics which emerged in the early seventeenth century for the equal temperament musical scale. Of course, it must be understood that only rational convergents to the cube root of 2 are used. The relationship of room plan and elevation ratios in Palazzo Della Torre is illustrated by using the technique shown in Barbaro La Practica della Perspecttiva in which three-dimensional objects are unfolded to make two-dimensional "nets", but figures are not used.

J	Buitrago, AR; Huylebrouck, D				Redondo Buitrago, Antonia; Huylebrouck, Dirk			Nonagons in the Hagia Sophia and the Selimiye Mosque	NEXUS NETWORK JOURNAL			English	Article						Ruler and compass construction; Nonagon; Selimiye Mosque; Hagia Sophia; Minbar; Mimar Sinan		One of the classical topics in geometry is the ruler and compass construction of good approximations of the regular nonagon. We propose a method to choose a desired error of approximation, based on new linear third-order recurrence relations. It is related to patterns shown on the balustrade of minbar of Selimiye Mosque in Edirne (Turkey, 1569-1575), where apparently regular nonagons are placed over a net of regular hexagons. This kind of ornament also occurs in Hagia Sophia in the minbar, in freezes stucco carvings and in window grilles. In Medieval Islamic art and architecture the use of the nonagon is not frequent, but it is remarkable that this particular grid of interlocked nonagons and hexagons appears in the decorations of the works of Ottoman architect Mimar Sinan. The pattern is present in his masterpiece, the Selimiye Mosque, in the Hagia Sophia and in other works in the Istanbul city. Looking at practical ways for the construction of the pattern, we provide simple procedures to obtain angles close to 40A degrees that could have been useful for a craftsman to realize the nonagonal geometric designs. In particular, almost regular nonagons are constructed using some elementary shapes that are related with semi-regular tessellations. We compare the patterns obtained through theoretical considerations to those displayed in the examples given above. Several hypotheses are proposed for the practical construction of the interlocked hexagonal patterns for nonagons.

Rowland; Union Trust Guardian Building; Detroit; Michigan; Modern American commercial architecture; Dynamic symmetry; Root-two; Ad quadratum; Ad triangulum; Incommensurate values; Art Deco		American architect Wirt C. Rowland designed and constructed Detroit, Michigan's Union Trust Guardian Building in the late 1920s, during his tenure with Smith, Hinchman and Grylls Associates. It is a masterpiece of American commercial architecture and one of the foremost Art Deco structures in the world. The bold geometric patterns that adorn the Guardian's surfaces announce that geometry is in play. We propose that Rowland organized the building's complex colorful designs around geometric proportioning systems. We review geometric methods available to Rowland in his day, and then reconstruct portions of the Guardian's design utilizing dynamic symmetry, ad quadratum, and ad triangulum constructions.

J	Yazar, T				Yazar, Tugrul			Design of Dataflow	NEXUS NETWORK JOURNAL			English	Article						Design scripting; Dataflow; Pedagogical patterns; Parametric modeling; Visual programming; Design education	PROGRAMMING-LANGUAGES	Design scripting is initially based on secondary syntactic mechanisms that control sequential executions of code. This model of computation, called control flow programming, was introduced to designers as the only way of creating algorithms. Dataflow represents a widespread alternative to control flow by utilizing concurrent streams of data. Dataflow programming languages are also considered to be pedagogical tools in fields where the coders are not expert computer programmers. In the last decade, new parametric modeling tools introduced this conception to design scripting, shifting its practical and educational foundations. Dataflow programming represents a promising platform for studying contemporary parametric modeling techniques in design, while architects and designers increasingly use it as their algorithmic sketchbooks. This paper describes a purpose to reflect this shift in design education, pursuing four pedagogical patterns derived from in-class experiments: "explication", "kit of components", "objectification", and "re-generation".
