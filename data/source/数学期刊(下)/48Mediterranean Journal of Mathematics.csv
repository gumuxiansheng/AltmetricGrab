We employ a random mean value theorem to achieve our goals in this work. The implicit Runge-Kutta method is presented and the conditions for the mean square convergence are established. Finally, illustrative examples are included in which the main statistical properties such as the mean and the variance of the random approximate solution process are given. The closeness of the original and approximate solutions is measured in the sense of the L (2)-norm on Banach space and with probability one.

First the sigma-additive case is studied, without particular assumptions on the filter; later the finitely additive case is faced, first assuming uniform s-boundedness (without restrictions on the filter), then relaxing this condition but imposing stronger properties on the filter. In order to obtain the last results, a Schur-type convergence theorem, obtained in Boccuto et al. (Math Slovaca 62(6):1145-1166, 2012), is used.

Almost Kahler Ricci Flows and Einstein and Lagrange-Finsler Structures on Lie Algebroids	MEDITERRANEAN JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICS			English	Article						Ricci flows; almost Kahler structures; Lie algebroids; Lagrange mechanics; Finsler geometry; effective Einstein spaces		In this work we investigate Ricci flows of almost Kahler structures on Lie algebroids when the fundamental geometric objects are completely determined by (semi) Riemannian metrics, or (effective) regular generating Lagrange/Finsler functions. There are constructed canonical almost symplectic connections for which the geometric flows can be represented as gradient ones and characterized by nonholonomic deformations of Grigory Perelman's functionals. The first goal of this paper is to define such thermodynamical type values and derive almost Kahler-Ricci geometric evolution equations. The second goal is to study how fixed Lie algebroid, i.e. Ricci soliton, configurations can be constructed for Riemannian manifolds and/or (co) tangent bundles endowed with nonholonomic distributions modelling (generalized) Einstein or Finsler-Cartan spaces. Finally, some examples of generic off-diagonal solutions for Lie algebroid-type Ricci solitons and (effective) Einstein and Lagrange-Finsler algebroids are provided.

Let M be a Riemannian submanifold of a manifold with an almost complex structure J. It is called a CR submanifold in the sense of Bejancu (Geometry of CR Submanifolds. D. Reidel Publ. Dordrecht, 1986) if there exists a C (a)-differentiable holomorphic distribution in the tangent bundle such that its orthogonal complement in the tangent bundle is totally real. If the second fundamental form vanishes on , the submanifold is -geodesic. The first example of a three-dimensional CR submanifold was constructed by Sekigawa (Tensor N S 41:13-20, 1984). This example was later generalized by Hashimoto and Mashimo (Nagoya Math J 156:171-185, 1999). Note that both the original example as well as its generalizations are - and -geodesic. Here, we investigate the class of the three-dimensional minimal CR submanifolds M of the nearly Kahler sphere S (6)(1) which are not linearly full. We show that this class coincides with the class of - and - geodesic CR submanifolds and we obtain a complete classification of such submanifolds. In particular, we show that apart from one special example, the examples of Hashimoto and Mashimo are the only - and -geodesic CR submanifolds.

We present integral representation for the class that we have considered for our study. Representation of minimal surface associated with this class is also given whenever the second complex dilatation is a square of an analytic function. Also, we determine a general sufficient condition for a sense preserving harmonic function to be univalent and close-to-convex in . Finally, we examine the disk of univalency and close-to-convexity of certain classes of harmonic functions.

This algorithm is based on Korpelevich's extragradient method and viscosity approximation method. We prove a strong convergence theorem for the sequences generated by the algorithm. As applications, at the end of paper we utilize our results to study finding a common point of the solution set of an variational inequality problem and the fixed-point set of a finite family of strictly pseudo-contractive mappings. The results presented in this paper improve, extend, supplement and develop the corresponding results announced in the earlier and very recent literature.

The right-hand side f of the equation is taken in a weighted Lebesgue space. One of the main issues of this work is that the domain Q can possibly be nonregular, for instance, the singular case where is allowed. The method used is based on the approximation of the domain Q by a sequence of subdomains which can be transformed into regular domains. This work is an extension of the one space variable case studied in [1].

The aim of this paper is to show that the set of all normal upper (lower) semicontinuous functions on a completely regular topological space can be endowed with an algebraic structure and lattice operations such that it becomes a Dedekind complete Riesz space that is the Dedekind completion of C (b) (X), the Riesz space of all bounded continuous functions on X. The Dedekind completion of C(X) is also obtained.

We investigate the behavior of the solutions of a general system of equations, regarding the norm of a Banach function space based on a vector measure. To this aim we construct a vector measure by an standard procedure. Assuming that the solution of each individual equation of the system belongs to a Banach function space based on scalar measures we deduce, with natural conditions, that a solution of such system belongs to a Banach function space based on a vector measure. We also give an example of a system of non-linear Bernoulli equations and show the relation with an equation involving the integral operator.

Contemp Math., Amer. Math. Soc., Providence 293:153-193, 2002) and McClure and Smith (J Am Math Soc 16(3):681-704, 2003). Its homology is the Gerstenhaber dg operad . We construct a map of dg operads such that is commutative and is the canonical map . This formalises the idea that, since the cup product is commutative in homology, its symmetrisation is a homotopy associative operation. Our explicit structure does not vanish on non-trivial shuffles in higher degrees, so does not give a map . If such a map could be written down explicitly, it would immediately lead to a structure on and on Hochschild cochains, that is, to an explicit and direct proof of the Deligne conjecture.

We then introduce jumps in both the price process and the volatility and compute the Greeks. In all this, we use Malliavin calculus. Finally, we consider the Greeks for the L,vy process. In particular, we compute Delta of an approximation of a L,vy process and then bypass through the limit arguments to obtain Delta for the original L,vy process.

Solvability of Age-Structured Epidemiological Models with Intracohort Transmission	MEDITERRANEAN JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICS			English	Article						Age-structured population; epidemiology; McKendrick model; semilinear equation		The standard version of the epidemiological model with continuous age structure (Iannelli, Mathematical Theory of Age-Structured Population Dynamics, 1995) consists of the linear McKendrick model for the evolution of a disease-free population, coupled with one of the classical (SIS, SIR, etc.) models for the spread of the disease. A natural functional space in which the linear McKendrick model is well posed is the space of integrable functions. However, in the so-called intracohort models, the disease term contains pointwise products of the unknown functions; that is, of the age-specific densities of susceptibles, infectives and other classes (if applicable) which render the standard semilinear perturbation technique of proving the well-posedness of the full model not applicable in that space. This is due to the fact that the product of two integrable functions need not be integrable. Therefore, most works on the well-posedness of such problems have been done under additional assumption that the disease-free population is stable and the equilibrium has been reached (Busenberg et al. SIAM J Math Anal 22(4):1065-1080, 1991, Pru, J Math Biol 11:65-84, 1981). This allowed for showing, after some algebraic manipulations, that the order interval [0, 1] in the space of integrable functions was invariant under the action of the linear McKendrick semigroup and thus the usual iteration technique could be applied in this interval, yielding a bounded solution. An additional advantage of adopting the stability assumption was that it eliminated from the model the death rate which, in all realistic cases, is unbounded and creates serious technical difficulties. The aim of this note is to show that a careful modification of the standard Picard iteration procedure allows for proving the same result without the stability assumption. Since in such a case we are not able to suppress the unbounded death rate, we will briefly present the necessary linear results in a way which simplifies and unifies some classical results existing in the literature (Inaba, Math Popul Stud 1:49-77, 1988, Pru, J Math Biol 11:65-84, 1981, Webb, Theory of Nonlinear Age Dependent Population Dynamics, 1985).

Solving a Generalized Gauss Problem	MEDITERRANEAN JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICS			English	Article						Generalized Gauss problem; generalized Gauss variable; weighted Fermat-Torricelli problem; weighted Fermat-Torricelli point; absorbing Fermat-Torricelli tree; absorbing generalized Gauss tree	EVOLUTIONARY STRUCTURE; CONVEX QUADRILATERALS; TREES	We solve a generalized Gauss problem in the Euclidean plane which states that: Given a convex quadrilateral, a positive number (weight) that corresponds to each of its vertices and a length of a linear segment which connects two mobile interior points of the quadrilateral find the minimum weighted network, which connects two of the vertices with one interior point and the other two with another interior point (Generalized Gauss tree). Furthermore, we introduce a generalized Gauss variable which corresponds to the unknown weight of the given distance which connects the two mobile interior points and obtain a degenerate generalized Gauss tree which corresponds to a specific value of the generalized Gauss variable that minimizes the length of the induced generalized Gauss trees and the weighted Fermat-Torricelli tree for a specific value of the generalized Gauss variable that maximizes the length of the induced generalized Gauss trees. Following this technique, we introduce a new class of generalized Gauss trees that we call absorbing generalized Gauss trees and a new class of Fermat-Torricelli trees that we call absorbing Fermat-Torricelli trees with respect to the sum of the four given weights of the convex quadrilateral.

J	Liao, JD; Yang, SH				Liao, Jiangdong; Yang, Shihui			Two Improvements on the Erdos, Harary and Klawe Conjecture	MEDITERRANEAN JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICS			English	Article						Residual-graph; cartesian product; composite graph; joining of graphs		A graph G is said to be F-residual if for every vertex u in G, the graph obtained by removing the closed neighborhood of u from G is isomorphic to F, here F is a given graph. Inductively, define a multiple-F-residual graph by saying that G is m-F-residual if the removal of the closed neighborhood of any vertex of G results in an (m - 1)-F-residual graph. Erdos et al. in Ann Discrete Math 6:117-123, (1980) determined the minimum order of the m-K (n) -residual graphs for all m and n, which are not necessarily connected, the minimum order of connected; K (n) -residual graphs, all K (n) -residual extremal graphs and some canonical connected m-K (n) -residual graphs. They also stated two conjectures regarding the connected m-K (n) -residual graphs. It is discussed for the case that m = 2 and n a parts per thousand yen 4 in Shihui Yang Oper Res 2:71-82, (1984) and Liao et al. in Mediterr J Math 625-641, (2013). In this paper, [Improvement 1] we show that G* = G[K (t) ] is an m-K (nt) -residual graph, whenever G is an m-K (n) -residual graph, and for odd n, C (5)[K (n) ] is the unique K (2n) -residual graph with the least odd in Yang and Duan in ACTA Math Appl Sinica 34:765-778, (2011); there is a unique connected 2-K (6)-residual graph, which is not isomorphic to K (8) x K (3) of the minimum order. [Improvement 2] we prove that for every n a parts per thousand yen 3, there is an integer denoted by I center dot(n), for every m a parts per thousand yen I center dot(n), the minimum order denoted by I center dot (n(m)) of connected m-K (n) -residual graphs is (m+3)n+m-1, and is the unique up to isomorphism extremal graph for every m > I center dot(n). Furthermore, we determined that I center dot(3) = 4, I center dot(4) = 7, and I center dot(n) a parts per thousand currency sign 2n - 3, n a parts per thousand yen 5. In particular, we determine the minimum order of connected m-K (n) -residual graphs for n = 3, 4 and every m a parts per thousand yen 2, and all the corresponding extremal graphs.

First, we consider pre-Lie groups, i.e., semi-topological groups with compatible differential triads and we prove that such groups have "left-invariant vector fields" and "left-invariant derivations", behaving like the classical ones. Next, for every pre-Lie group, we define an appropriate Lie algebra and prove the existence of a naturally associated adjoint representation of the initial group into the latter.

In this paper, the authors consider the case of a layer of viscous fluid. Using the methods of functional analysis, they obtain from the variational form of the equations of motions, an operatorial equation in a Hilbert space. They reduce the problem of the small oscillations to the study of an operator pencil and, so, they can determine the spectrum of the problem and specify the set of eigenvalues according to the coefficient of viscosity. They also give results concerning the solutions of the evolution problem by means of the theory of the semi-group.
