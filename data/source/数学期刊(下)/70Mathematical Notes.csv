The values of the pressure P and of the compressibility factor Z on the spinodal in the negative pressure region for the van der Waals equation determine the value of gamma, gamma(T) < 0, for mu = 0.

To determine how the number of degrees of freedom depends on temperature, we use the main formula expressing the compressibility factor via the ratio of two Riemann functions. The behavior of the second virial coefficient is studied for a given spinodal, which serves as an analog of caustics. The gas- and liquid-amorphous solid transitions are considered on the second sheet. An argument in favor of the mapping of the second sheet onto the negative quadrant {-P,-Z} is presented.

On the Monge-Kantorovich Problem with Additional Linear Constraints	MATHEMATICAL NOTES			English	Article						Monge-Kantorovich problem; optimal transportation plan; Kantorovich duality	THEOREMS	TheMonge-Kantorovich problem with the following additional constraint is considered: the admissible transportation plan must become zero on a fixed subspace of functions. Different subspaces give rise to different additional conditions on transportation plans. The main results are stated in general form and can be carried over to a number of important special cases. They are also valid for the Monge-Kantorovich problem whose solution is sought for the class of invariant or martingale measures. We formulate and prove a criterion for the existence of an optimal solution, a duality assertion of Kantorovich type, and a necessary geometric condition on the support of the optimal measure similar to the standard condition for c-monotonicity.

Inverse problem of determining the one-dimensional kernel of the viscoelasticity equation in a bounded domain	MATHEMATICAL NOTES			English	Article						viscoelasticity equation; integro-differential equation; Lame coefficient; displacement function; contraction mapping principle; stress function	MEMORY RECONSTRUCTION; SYSTEM	The one-dimensional integro-differential equation arising in the theory of viscoelasticity with constant density and Lam, coefficients is considered. The direct problem is to determine the displacement function from the initial boundary-value problem for this equation, provided that the initial conditions are zero. The spatial domain is the closed interval [0, l], and the boundary condition is given by the stress function in the form of a concentrated perturbation source at the left endpoint of this interval and as zero at the right endpoint. For the direct problem, we study the inverse problem of determining the kernel appearing in the integral term of the equation. To find it, we introduce an additional condition for the displacement function at x = 0. The inverse problem is replaced by an equivalent system of integral equations for the unknown functions. The contraction mapping principle is applied to this system in the space of continuous functions with weighted norms. A theorem on the global unique solvability is proved.	[Durdiev, D.

A class of nonergodic Lotka-Volterra operators	MATHEMATICAL NOTES			English	Article						Lotka-Volterra operator; ergodicity; quadratic stochastic operator		On the basis of some numerical calculations, Ulam has conjectured that the ergodic theorem holds for any quadratic stochastic operator acting on a finite-dimensional simplex. However, Zakharevich showed that Ulam's conjecture is false in general. Later, Ganikhodzhaev and Zanin generalized Zakharevich's example to the class of quadratic stochastic Volterra operators acting on a 2D simplex. In this paper, we provide a class of nonergodic Lotka-Volterra operators which includes all previous operators used in this context.

In the case of Lagrangian manifolds invariant with respect to Hamiltonian flow with Hamiltonians of the form F(x, |p|), we show how asymptotic formulas can be simplified by using the well-known (in classical mechanics) Maupertuis-Jacobi correspondence principle to replace the Hamiltonians F(x, |p|) by Hamiltonians of the form C(x)|p| arising, in particular, in geometric optics and related to the Finsler metric. As examples, we consider Hamiltonians corresponding to the Schrodinger equation, the two-dimensional Dirac equation, and the pseudodifferential equations for surface water waves.	[Dobrokhotov, S.

Vinberg suggested a method for constructing such bases by applying the lowering operators corresponding to all negative roots to the highest-weight vector and put forward a number of conjectures on the parametrization and structure of such bases. It follows from papers by Feigin, Fourier, and Littelmann that these conjectures are true for the cases of A (n) and C (n) . In the present paper, we prove these conjectures for the case of G (2) by using a different approach suggested by Vinberg.

Small denominators hampering the convergence of series appear in the process of constructing the solution of the problem by the spectral decomposition method. A uniqueness criterion for the solution is established. In the two-dimensional case, estimates justifying the existence of a solution of the Dirichlet problem are obtained. In the three-dimensional case where the domain is a cube, it is shown that the uniqueness of the solution of the Dirichlet problem is equivalent to the great Fermat problem.	[Sabitov, K.

The following results are obtained. If X = X*, Y = Y* are tau-measurable operators and XY a L (1)(M, tau), then YX a L (1)(M, tau) and tau(XY) = tau(YX) a R. In particular, if X, Y a B(H)(sa) and XY a G (1), then YX a G (1) and tr(XY) = tr(YX) a R. If X a L (1)(M, tau), then . Let A be a tau-measurable operator. If the operator A is tau-compact and V a M is a contraction, then it follows from V* AV = A that V A = AV. We have A = A (2) if and only if A = |A*||A|. This representation is also new for bounded idempotents in H. If A = A (2) a L (1)(M, tau), then . If A = A (2) and A (or A*) is semihyponormal, then A is normal, thus A is a projection. If A = A (3) and A is hyponormal or cohyponormal, then A is normal, and thus A = A* a M is the difference of two mutually orthogonal projections (A + A (2))/2 and (A (2) - A)/2. If A,A (2) a L (1)(M, tau) and A = A (3), then tau(A) is an element of R.	Kazan Fed Univ, Kazan, Russia	Bikchentaev, AM (reprint author), Kazan Fed Univ, Kazan, Russia.

Generalization of tropical geometry and amebas to the region of negative pressures: Comparison with van der waals gas	MATHEMATICAL NOTES			English	Article						negative pressure; number of degrees of freedom; ameba in tropical analysis; Fermi-Dirac distribution		In the region of negative pressures P, the addend gamma corresponding to the number of degrees of freedom D = 2 gamma + 2 is less than zero. The energy equal to E = V P is also less than zero. Therefore, it is natural to introduce a negative relative temperature as the mean energy. The negative pressure on the negative spinodal tends to minus infinity as T (r) -> 0. Accordingly, the negative relative temperature will also approach minus infinity. As the chemical potential mu ->-a, mu/T -> 0, the asymptotic behavior of the thermodynamic quantities gives rise to amebas of special form in tropical (idempotent) analysis. It is shown that the theoretical isotherms obtained in this paper coincide with the isotherms of van derWaals gas up to the third decimal place. For theoretical distributions, transitions to amorphic solids (glass) occurs.	[Maslov, V. P.] Natl Res Univ, Higher Sch Econ, Moscow, Russia; [Maslov, V.

Best approximation rate of constants by simple partial fractions and Chebyshev alternance	MATHEMATICAL NOTES			English	Article						best approximation of constants; simple partial fraction; Chebyshev alternance	CRITERION	We consider the problem of interpolation and best uniform approximation of constants c not equal 0 by simple partial fractions rho (n) of order n on an interval [a, b]. (All functions and numbers considered are real.) For the case in which n > 4|c|(b - a), we prove that the interpolation problem is uniquely solvable, obtain upper and lower bounds, sharp in order n, for the interpolation error on the set of all interpolation points, and show that the poles of the interpolating fraction lie outside the disk with diameter [a, b]. We obtain an analog of Chebyshev's classical theorem on the minimum deviation of a monic polynomial of degree n from a constant. Namely, we show that, for n > 4|c|(b - a), the best approximation fraction rho* (n) for the constant c on [a, b] is unique and can be characterized by the Chebyshev alternance of n+1 points for the difference rho* (n) - c. For theminimum deviations, we obtain an estimate sharp in order n.

J	Beloshapka, VK				Beloshapka, V. K.			A Seven-Dimensional Family of Simple Harmonic Functions	MATHEMATICAL NOTES			English	Article						analytical complexity; harmonic function; elliptic function	ANALYTIC COMPLEXITY	From the point of view of analytic complexity theory, all harmonic functions of two variables split into three classes: functions of complexity zero, one, and two. Only linear functions of one variable have complexity zero. This paper contains a complete description of simple harmonic functions, i.e., of functions of analytic complexity one. These functions constitute a seven-dimensional family expressible as integrals of elliptic functions. All other harmonic functions have complexity two and are, in this sense, of higher complexity. Solutions of the wave equation, the heat equation, and the Hopf equation are also studied.	[Beloshapka, V.

On a Remarkable Sequence of Bessel Matrices	MATHEMATICAL NOTES			English	Article						modified Bessel function of the first kind; double confluent Heun equation; Bessel matrix; Josephson junction; Laurent series; Hessenberg matrix		A sequence of matrices whose elements are modified Bessel functions of the first kind is considered. Such a sequence arises when studying certain ordinary linear homogeneous second-order differential equations belonging to the family of double confluent Heun equations. The conjecture that these matrices are nonsingular is discussed together with its application to the problem of the existence of solutions analytic at the singular point of the equation referred to above.

The optimal argument is the least value of the argument in the modulus of continuity for which the exact constant in the Jackson inequality takes the minimum value. The approximation is carried out by partial integrals of the multidimensional Jacobi transform. In the study of the optimal argument, the geometry of the domain of the partial integral and the geometry of the neighborhood of zero in the definition of the modulus of continuity are taken into account. The optimal argument is obtained for the case in which the first skew field is an l (p) -ball for 1 a parts per thousand currency sign p a parts per thousand currency sign 2 and the second, a parallelepiped.

By using the homotopy technique of differential Lie modules over colored coalgebras, the homotopy invariance of the structure of a differential module with a-simplicial faces is proved. A relationship between differential modules with a-simplicial faces and A (a)-algebras is described. The notions of the chain realization of a differential module with a-simplicial faces and the tensor product of differential modules with a-simplicial faces are introduced. It is shown that the chain realization of a tensor differential module with a-simplicial faces constructed from an A (a)-algebra and the B-construction over this A (a)-algebra are isomorphic differential coalgebras.

Embedding of Sobolev space in the case of the limit exponent	MATHEMATICAL NOTES			English	Article						Sobolev space W-p(s); the space B-pq(s); locally summable function of zero smoothness; Lorentz space; Lorentz-Zygmund space; space of potentials	OPERATORS	We establish the embeddings of the Sobolev space W (p) (s) and the space B (pq) (s) (in the case of the limit exponent) in the spaces of locally summable functions of zero smoothness. This refines the embeddings of the Sobolev space in the Lorentz space and in the Lorentz-Zygmund space. The relationship between the Lorentz spaces and the corresponding spaces of functions of zero smoothness is established. Similar embeddings of the spaces of potentials are determined.

Degrees of irreducible characters and dimensions of Hadamard algebras	MATHEMATICAL NOTES			English	Article						Hadamard decomposition; Hadamard algebra; Hadamard matrix; irreducible character	ASSOCIATIVE ALGEBRAS; DECOMPOSITIONS	The notion of Hadamard decomposition of a semisimple associative finite-dimensional complex algebra generalizes the notion of classical Hadamard matrix corresponding to the case of commutative algebras. The algebras admitting a Hadamard decomposition are referred to as Hadamard algebras. We study the conjecture claiming that, if aHadamard algebra is not simple and has an irreducible character of degree m a parts per thousand yen 2, then the dimension of the algebra is not less than 2m (2). The validity of this conjecture is confirmed for the first two values m = 2and m = 4(here m must be even). Moreover, we prove a result (which is weaker than the conjecture) in which 2m (2) is replaced by m (2) + 2m.	[Ivanov, D. N.] Tver Innoctr, Tver, Russia; [Ivanov, D.

The discrete Heisenberg group and its automorphism group	MATHEMATICAL NOTES			English	Article						discrete Heisenberg group; automorphism group; structure theorem		In this note, we give a simpler and shorter proof of the claim, which is originally due to Kahn [ 1], that the automorphism group of the discrete Heisenberg group Heis(3, Z) is isomorphic to the group (Z. Z) similar to GL(2, Z). Our method for constructing this isomorphism provides a much clearer picture of the structure of the automorphism group of Heis(3, Z). Consider the discrete Heisenberg group G = Heis(3, Z), which is the group of matrices of the form where the entries a, b, and c are elements of the group Z. The group G can also be viewed as the set of all integer triples equipped with the group law where Inn(G) similar or equal to G/C similar or equal to Z. Z is the inner automorphism group and the homomorphism. is the homomorphism Aut(G). Aut(Z. Z) induced by the homomorphism. in the exact sequence (3). Clearly, Im(.). Ker(nu).

By using multiple Lyapunov-functions and the dwell-time approach, several criteria on globally exponential stability are established. It is shown that by suitably controlling the switching between the stable and unstable subsystems, the globally exponential stability of the nonlinear impulsive switched systems can be achieved. Finally, an example is given to show the effectiveness of the derived results.

On Two-dimensional sums and differences	MATHEMATICAL NOTES			English	Article						two-dimensional sum and difference; Abelian group; coset with respect to a subgroup; symmetry set; Kneser's theorem	SETS	The present paper deals with a generalization of a well-known theorem for a set A subset of G, where G is an arbitrary Abelian group. According to this classical result, it follows from vertical bar A + A vertical bar < (3/2)vertical bar A vertical bar or vertical bar A - A vertical bar < (3/2)vertical bar A vertical bar that A subset of H, where H is a coset with respect to some subgroup of G and vertical bar H vertical bar <= (3/2)vertical bar A vertical bar. Consider the sets A (2) +/- Delta(A) subset of G (2) (two-dimensional sum and difference). Here A (2) = A x A is the set of pairs of elements from A and Delta(A) is the diagonal set Delta(A) = {(a, a) is an element of G x G vertical bar a is an element of A}. The main result involves the given sets and is as follows. If vertical bar A (2) +/- Delta(A)vertical bar < 7/4 vertical bar A vertical bar(2), then A subset of H + x for some x a G and subgroup H subset of G, where vertical bar H vertical bar < 3/2 vertical bar A vertical bar.

For this class, parameter-dependent trigonometric sums over points of quasilattice are considered. Nontrivial estimates of the trigonometric sums under consideration are obtained. For a number of trigonometric sums of special form, asymptotic formulas are derived. It is proved that the distribution of points of quasilattices is uniform modulo h for almost all h. Earlier similar results were obtained in the particular case of quasilattices parametrized by the rotations of the circle.

Two continuations of the solution S are considered: to (-infinity, 0] and to [r, infinity). A Wiener-Hopf-type factorization is used. Under invertibility conditions for some operators, the problem can be reduced to two equations with sum kernels: H-+/-(x) = q(0)(+/-)(x) -/+ integral(infinity)(0) U(x + t + r)H-+/-(t) dt, x > 0, U is an element of L+. Applied aspects of the realization of the method are discussed.

A left R-module M is called n-copure projective if Ext (R) (1) (M,F) = 0 for any F a F (n) . Some examples are given to show that n-copure projective modules need not be m-copure projective whenever m > n. Then we characterize the well-known QF rings and IF rings in terms of n-copure projective modules. Finally, we prove that a ring R is relative left hereditary if and only if every submodule of a projective (or free) left R-module is n-copure projective if and only if id (R) (N) a parts per thousand currency sign 1 for every left R-module N with N a F (n) .

The cross-sections are perpendicular to the main diagonal of the cube. The first proof is carried out by a gradual reconstruction of the polyhedra, while the second one employs a direct calculation of the volumes by representing the polyhedra as the algebraic sum of convex cones.

It is known that, for any bounded function f, the equation u' - Au = f with bisectorial operator A has a unique bounded solution u, which is the convolution of f with the Green function. An example of a bisectorial operator generating a Green function unbounded at zero is given.

Quantitative Expressions for the Connectedness of Sets in R-n	MATHEMATICAL NOTES			English	Article						connectedness; Hausdorff dimension; Lipschitz property; Euclidean space		We prove that, for two arbitrary points a and b of a connected set E subset of R-n (n >= 2) and for any epsilon > 0, there exist points x(0) = a, x(2),..., x(p) = b in E such that parallel to x(1) - x(0)parallel to(n) + ... +parallel to x(p) - x(p-1)parallel to(n) < epsilon.

Towards such an objective, we rephrase the completeness condition in terms of an integral against the monomials {x (n) (k) } of the coordinates functions associated to the Garding vectors of G, whose Fourier transform are shown to admit an analytic continuation to the whole complex plane with an exponential domination. This allows us to formulate and prove several variants of Muntz-SzA sz's theorem in these settings. These upshots are proved using the Plancherel theory related to the group Fourier transform.

Perturbation theory of observable linear systems	MATHEMATICAL NOTES			English	Article						linear controllable dynamical system; time-optimal damping; cost function; Pontryagin maximum principle; feedback control	SETS	The present work is motivated by the asymptotic control theory for a system of linear oscillators: the problem is to design a common bounded scalar control for damping all oscillators in asymptotically minimal time. The motion of the system is described in terms of a canonical system similar to that of the Pontryagin maximum principle. We consider the evolution equation for adjoint variables as a perturbed observable linear system. Due to the perturbation, the unobservable part of the state trajectory cannot be recovered exactly. We estimate the recovering error via the L (1)-norm of perturbation. This allows us to prove that the control makes the system approach the equilibrium state with a strictly positive speed.

This question was answered by Ga t in 1997. The aim of this paper is to investigate the maximal operator of the sup (n) |sigma (n) |. Among other things, we prove that this operator is bounded from the Hardy space H (p) to the Lebesgue space L (p) if and only if 1/2 < p < a. The two-dimensional maximal operator is also discussed.

The finiteness of coassociated primes of generalized local homology modules	MATHEMATICAL NOTES			English	Article						linearly compact module; local homology; local cohomology	COHOMOLOGY MODULES	We present some finiteness results for co-associated primes of generalized local homology modules. Let M be a finitely generated R-module and N a linearly compact R-module. If N and H (i) (I) (N) satisfy the finiteness condition for co-associated primes for all i < k, then Coass (R) (H (k) (I) (M,N)) is a finite set. On the other hand, if H (i) (I) (N) = 0 for all i < t and Tor (j) (R) (M,H (t) (i) (N)) = 0 for all j < h, then Tor (h) (R) (M,H (t) (I) (N)) a parts per thousand... H (h+t) (I) (M,N). Moreover, Coass(H (h+t) (I) (M,N)) is also a finite set providedN satisfies the finiteness condition for co-associated primes. Finally, N is a semi-discrete linearly compact R-module such that 0: (N) I not equal 0. Let t=Width (I) (N) and h = tor_(M,H (t) (I) (N)); it follows that Width (I+Ann(M))(N) = t + h and Coass(H (h+t) (I) (M,N)) is a finite set.	[Nam, T. T.; Yen, D.

The control parameters of the players are additive terms on the right-hand side of the equation. New spaces depending on a nonnegative parameter are introduced by using generalized eigenvalues and generalized eigenfunctions of the given elliptic operator. Games are introduced and studied on the entire scale of these spaces. Sufficient conditions for the possibility of evasion in games obtained under various constraints on the control parameters are given.	[Satimov, N.

An existence principle which can be used for problems where f(t, x, y) may have singularities at t = 0, t = T and also at x = 0, y = 0, is proved here. As an application of this principle, new conditions that guarantee the solvability of the above problem are found.

Nonexistence of global solutions for quasilinear backward parabolic inequalities with p-Laplace-type operator	MATHEMATICAL NOTES			English	Article						quasilinear backward parabolic inequality; p-Laplace-type operator; Dirichlet boundary condition; Young's inequality; Fatou theorem; Holder's inequality	INITIAL DATA; HEAT-EQUATION; SLOW DECAY; BLOW-UP	In this paper, we prove the nonexistence of global solutions to the quasilinear backward parabolic inequality u(t) + div(vertical bar x vertical bar(alpha)vertical bar u vertical bar(beta)vertical bar Du vertical bar(p-2) Du) >= vertical bar x vertical bar(gamma)vertical bar u vertical bar(q-1)u, x is an element of Omega, t >= 0 with homogeneous Dirichlet boundary condition and bounded integrable sign-changing initial function, where Omega is a bounded smooth domain in R-N. The proof is based on the derivation of a priori estimates for the solutions and involves the algebraic analysis of the integral form of the inequality with an optimal choice of test functions. We establish conditions for the nonexistence of solutions based on the weak formulation of the problem with test functions of the form phi(R,epsilon)(x, t) = (+/- u(+/-)(x, t) + epsilon)(delta)phi(R)(x, t) for epsilon > 0, delta > 0, where u(+) and u(-) are the positive and negative parts of the solution u of the problem and phi(R) is the standard cut-off function whose support depends on the parameter R.

On the number of components of fixed size in a random A-mapping	MATHEMATICAL NOTES			English	Article						random A-mapping; Poisson random variable; asymptotic behavior of the joint distribution of random variables; regularly/slowly varying function in the sense of Karamata; Stirling's formula		Let S-n be the semigroup of mappings of a set of n elements into itself, let A be a fixed subset of the set of natural numbers N, and let V-n(A) be the set of mappings from S-n for which the sizes of the contours belong to the set A. Mappings from V-n(A) are usually called A-mappings. Consider a random mapping sigma(n) uniformly distributed on V-n(A). It is assumed that the set A possesses asymptotic density d, including the case d = 0. Let xi(in) be the number of connected components of a random mapping sigma(n) of size i is an element of N. For a fixed integer b is an element of N, as n -> infinity, the asymptotic behavior of the joint distribution of random variables xi(1n), xi(2n), ... , xi(bn) is studied. It is shown that this distribution weakly converges to the joint distribution of independent Poisson random variables eta(1), eta(2) , ..., eta(b) with some parameters lambda(i) = E-eta i, i is an element of N.
