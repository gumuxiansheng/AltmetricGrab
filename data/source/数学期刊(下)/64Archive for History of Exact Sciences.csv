Solar and lunar observations at Istanbul in the 1570s	ARCHIVE FOR HISTORY OF EXACT SCIENCES			English	Article							MIDDLE-EAST; PARAMETERS; ASTRONOMY; ECLIPSES; ZIJ; AD	From the early ninth century until about eight centuries later, the Middle East witnessed a series of both simple and systematic astronomical observations for the purpose of testing contemporary astronomical tables and deriving the fundamental solar, lunar, and planetary parameters. Of them, the extensive observations of lunar eclipses available before 1000 AD for testing the ephemeredes computed from the astronomical tables are in a relatively sharp contrast to the twelve lunar observations that are pertained to the four extant accounts of the measurements of the basic parameters of Ptolemaic lunar model. The last of them are TaqA << al-DA << n Muayenammad b. Ma'rA << f's (1526-1585) trio of lunar eclipses observed from Istanbul, Cairo, and Thessalonica in 1576-1577 and documented in chapter 2 of book 5 of his famous work, Sidrat muntaha al-afkar fA << malakA << t al-falak al-dawwAr (The Lotus Tree in the Seventh Heaven of Reflection). In this article, we provide a detailed analysis of the accuracy of his solar (1577-1579) and lunar observations.	[Mozaffari, S.

Ibn al-Kammad's Muqtabis zij and the astronomical tradition of Indian origin in the Iberian Peninsula	ARCHIVE FOR HISTORY OF EXACT SCIENCES			English	Article							FRAGMENTS; TREATISE; TABLES; WORKS	In this paper, we analyze the astronomical tables in al-Zij al-Muqtabis by Ibn al-Kammad (early twelfth century, Cordoba), based on the Latin and Hebrew versions of the lost Arabic original, each of which is extant in a unique manuscript. We present excerpts of many tables and pay careful attention to their structure and underlying parameters. The main focus, however, is on the impact al-Muqtabis had on the astronomy that developed in the Iberian Peninsula and the Maghrib and, more generally, on the transmission and diffusion of Indian astronomy in the West after the arrival of al-Khwarizmi's astronomical tables in al-Andalus (Muslim Spain) in the tenth century. This tradition of Indian origin competed with the Greek tradition represented by al-Battani's astronomical tables and was much more alive in the Iberian Peninsula and the Maghrib than previously thought. From Spain, the Indian tradition entered mainstream European astronomy, where we find echoes of it in all versions of the Alfonsine Tables, both in manuscript and in the printed editions (beginning in 1483), as well as in Copernicus's De Revolutionibus, published in 1543.			josechabas@gmail.com						124	5	5	0	2	SPRINGER	NEW YORK	233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA	0003-9519	1432-0657		ARCH HIST EXACT SCI	Arch.

The purpose of this paper is to describe the genesis of this notion in Clifford's works and to provide a historical analysis of its reception in the investigations of F. Klein, L. Bianchi, G.

J	Ulivi, E				Ulivi, Elisabetta			Masters, questions and challenges in the abacus schools	ARCHIVE FOR HISTORY OF EXACT SCIENCES			English	Article							14TH-CENTURY	The mathematical scenario in Italy during the Late Middle Ages and the Renaissance is mainly dominated by the treatises on the abacus, which developed together with the abacus schools. In that context, between approximately the last thirty years of the fourteenth century and the first twenty years of the sixteenth century, the manuscript and printed tradition tell us of queries and challenges, barely known or totally unknown, in which the protagonists were abacus masters. We report in this work on the most significant examples and draw out interesting cues for thoughts and remarks of a scientific, historical and biographical nature. Five treatises, written in the fifteenth and sixteenth century, have been the main source of inspiration for this article: the Trattato di praticha d'arismetricha and the Tractato di praticha di geometria included in the codices Palat. 573 and Palat. 577 (c. 1460) kept in the Biblioteca Nazionale of Florence and written by an anonymous Florentine disciple of the abacist Domenico di Agostino Vaiaio; another Trattato di praticha d'arismetrica written by Benedetto di Antonio da Firenze in 1463 and included in the codex L.IV.21 kept in the Biblioteca Comunale of Siena; the Tractatus mathematicus ad discipulos perusinos written by Luca Pacioli between 1477 and 1480, manuscript Vat. Lat. 3129 of the Biblioteca Apostolica Vaticana; and Francesco Galigai's Summa de arithmetica, published in Florence in 1521.

J	Lazaroff-Puck, C				Lazaroff-Puck, Cameron			Gearing up for Lagrangian dynamics	ARCHIVE FOR HISTORY OF EXACT SCIENCES			English	Article								James Clerk Maxwell's 1865 paper, "A Dynamical Theory of the Electromagnetic Field," is usually remembered as replacing the mechanical model that underpins his 1862 publication with abstract mathematics. Up to this point historians have considered Maxwell's usage of Lagrangian dynamics as the sole important feature that guides Maxwell's analysis of electromagnetic phenomena in his 1865 publication. This paper offers an account of the often ignored mechanical analogy that Maxwell used to guide him and his readers in the construction of his new electromagnetic equations. The mechanical system consists of a weighted flywheel geared into two independently driven crank wheels in what amounts to a mechanical differential. I will demonstrate how Maxwell made use of the analogy between his flywheel system and electromagnetic induction to ground his study of electromagnetism in clear mechanical conceptions and to structure the derivation of the equations that together are now recognized as Maxwell's equations for electrodynamics. By reconceiving specific components of his model in electromagnetic terms, while at the same time retaining many of the relations between concepts in the mechanical case, Maxwell gradually assembled increasingly generalized equations for electromotive force. Maxwell thus realized a much sought after balance between physical analogy and abstract mathematics in this, the last of his three seminal papers on electromagnetism.

J	Confalonieri, S				Confalonieri, Sara			The casus irreducibilis in Cardano's Ars Magna and De Regula Aliza	ARCHIVE FOR HISTORY OF EXACT SCIENCES			English	Article								In Cardano's classification in the Ars Magna (1545, 1570), the cubic equations were arranged in thirteen families. This paper examines the well-known solution methods for the families and and then considers thoroughly the systematic interconnections between these two families and the remaining ones and provides a diagram to visualize the results clearly. In the analysis of these solution methods, we pay particular attention to the appearance of the square roots of negative numbers even when all the solutions are real-the so-called casus irreducibilis. The structure that comes to light enables us to fully appreciate the impact that the difficulty entailed by the casus irreducibilis had on Cardano's construction in the Ars Magna. Cardano tried to patch matters first in the Ars Magna itself and then in the De Regula Aliza (1570). We sketch the former briefly and analyze the latter in detail because Cardano considered it the ultimate solution. In particular, we examine one widespread technique that is based on what I have called splittings.

J	Masia, R				Masia, Ramon			On dating Hero of Alexandria	ARCHIVE FOR HISTORY OF EXACT SCIENCES			English	Article							DATE	The dating of Hero of Alexandria has been linked with the lunar eclipse of March 13, ad 62, since Otto Neugebauer discovered that this eclipse is the only one that can fit the one described in Hero's Dioptra 35. Although only a number of scholars claim that Hero himself observed the eclipse, almost all of them take Neugebauer's identification for granted. We use statistical and linguistic methods to criticize this assumption: all indices we have found point to the fact that the eclipse was merely invented as an example and, for that reason, that it cannot be used to determine Hero's life span.

J	Chemla, K; Ma, BA				Chemla, Karine; Ma, Biao			How do the earliest known mathematical writings highlight the state's management of grains in early imperial China?	ARCHIVE FOR HISTORY OF EXACT SCIENCES			English	Article								The earliest extant mathematical books from China contain a lot of problems and data about grains. They also betray a close relationship with imperial bureaucracy in this respect. Indeed, these texts quote administrative regulations about grains. For instance, the Book on mathematical procedures cae center dot ae >, found in a tomb sealed ca. 186 BCE, has a section in common with the "regulations on granaries" from the Qin statutes in eighteen domains, known thanks to slips excavated at Shuihudi. Mathematical writings also deal with official vessels used to measure grains. They cast light on statements from, and practices evidenced by, official histories and administrative documents. This article addresses the following issues. Which information about the concrete management of grains can we derive from mathematical writings in relation to administrative documents? Which data can we find in these writings about continuities and changes in the management of grains in the time span between the Qin and Han dynasties? In particular, how can we account for the fact that in a later mathematical text, namely, The Nine Chapters, probably completed in the first century CE, there was a change in the form in which the data about grain equivalences were given, by comparison with the "regulations on granaries"? Finally, what do our conclusions imply with respect to the nature of the earliest extant mathematical writings. In this article, we gather the various types of statement that mathematical writings contain about grains and offer several elements of interpretation for the "regulations on granaries" and the related text in The Nine Chapters. From this perspective, we offer several hypotheses about the management of grain in the Qin and Han dynasties.

We give a literal translation of the whole passage, along with paraphrases in more modern or symbolic form. We discuss the influence of the Euclidean tradition on al-Samaw'al's presentation, and the role that diagrams might have played in helping al-Samaw'al's readers follow his arguments, including his supposed use of an early form of mathematical induction.

J	Rittberg, CJ				Rittberg, Colin J.			How Woodin changed his mind: new thoughts on the Continuum Hypothesis	ARCHIVE FOR HISTORY OF EXACT SCIENCES			English	Article							CONSISTENCY; MODELS; AXIOM; DETERMINACY; PROOF	The Continuum Problem has inspired set theorists and philosophers since the days of Cantorian set theory. In the last 15 years, W. Hugh Woodin, a leading set theorist, has not only taken it upon himself to engage in this question, he has also changed his mind about the answer. This paper illustrates Woodin's solutions to the problem, starting in Sect. 3 with his 1999-2004 argument that Cantor's hypothesis about the continuum was incorrect. From 2010 onwards, Woodin presents a very different argument, an argument that Cantor's hypothesis is in fact true. This argument is still incomplete, but according to Woodin, some of the philosophical issues surrounding the Continuum Problem have been reduced to precise mathematical questions, questions that are, unlike Cantor's hypothesis, solvable from our current theory of sets.			jakob.rittberg@gmail.com						43	1	1	0	0	SPRINGER	NEW YORK	233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA	0003-9519	1432-0657		ARCH HIST EXACT SCI	Arch.

J	Chalmers, A				Chalmers, Alan			Robert Boyle's mechanical account of hydrostatics and pneumatics: fluidity, the spring of the air and their relationship to the concept of pressure	ARCHIVE FOR HISTORY OF EXACT SCIENCES			English	Article								This article in an attempt to identify the precise way in which Robert Boyle provided a mechanical account of the features that distinguish liquids and air from solids and from each other. In his pneumatics, Boyle articulated his notion of the 'spring' of the air for that purpose. Pressure appeared there only in a common, rather than in a technical, sense. It was when he turned to hydrostatics that Boyle found the need to introduce a technical sense of pressure to capture the fluidity of water which, unlike air, lacked a significant spring. Pressure, understood as representing the state of a liquid within the body of it rather than at its surface, enabled Boyle to trace the transmission of hydrostatic forces through liquids and thereby give a mechanical account of that transmission according to his understanding of the term. This was a major step towards the technical sense of pressure that was to be adopted in Newton's hydrostatics and in fluid mechanics thereafter.

J	Chen, JPJ				Chen, Jiang-Ping Jeff			Trigonometric tables: explicating their construction principles in China	ARCHIVE FOR HISTORY OF EXACT SCIENCES			English	Article								The trigonometric table and its construction principles were introduced to China as part of calendar reform, spear-headed by Xu Guangqi (1562-1633) in the late 1620s to early 1630s. Chinese scholars attempted and succeeded in uncovering how the construction principles were established in the seventeenth century and then in the eighteenth century expanded to include more algorithms to compute the values of trigonometric lines. Successful as they were in discoursing the construction principles, most Chinese scholars did not actually construct trigonometric tables anew. In the early nineteenth century, a revolutionary approach was developed, which resembles computing a finite sum of power series to trigonometric functions of an arbitrary arc less than a one-half circle. Though hailed by many modern historians as Chinese achievements in developing "infinite series" of trigonometric functions, this approach was viewed by the actors at the time as a quick means to construct trigonometric tables. Interestingly, even with these "quick" methods, no trigonometric table was constructed. Besides the fact that constructing a trigonometric table afresh is a time-consuming business, the classification of the trigonometric table and their construction principles into different genres of knowledge by scholars offers an additional explanation of drastically uneven treatment of trigonometric tables and their construction principles.

J	Nauenberg, M				Nauenberg, Michael			Solution to the long-standing puzzle of Huygens' "anomalous suspension"	ARCHIVE FOR HISTORY OF EXACT SCIENCES			English	Article								In 1662 Christiaan Huygens carried out the famous Torricelli experiment to test the existence of atmospheric pressure by inserting the apparatus in the glass receiver of a vacuum pump, and evacuating the air inside it. He reported that when the air was exhausted, a column of water remained suspended in a 4-foot tube. This unexpected result was in stark contrast with earlier experiments of Boyle and Hooke that apparently had confirmed Torricelli's explanation that such a water column was supported by outside air pressure, and would fall when the air was removed. Huygen's "anomalous suspension" led to the continuation of controversies in the seventeenth century about the nature of the vacuum that these experiments were expected to resolve. Surprisingly, the origin of Huygens' unexpected result has remained a puzzle up to the present time. In this paper, I discuss the dynamics of such a column of water under the experimental conditions reported by Boyle and by Huygens, that turned out to be different, and present the results of a replication of their experiments with a modern vacuum pump. Contrary to the conventional explanations of these experiments, I demonstrate that in the Boyle-Hooke version of this experiment, the water column descends initially because it is forced down by the gas pressure due to air dissolved in the water which is released inside the Torricelli tube after the external pressure is sufficiently decreased. Huygens, however, first removed this trapped air before he carried out his experiment. In the absence of this internal gas pressure, the early rudimentary vacuum pumps were inadequate to decrease the air pressure sufficiently inside the receiver to demonstrate the descent of a Torricelli column of airless water 4-foot in height or less.

J	Graham, DW				Graham, Daniel W.			On Philolaus' astronomy	ARCHIVE FOR HISTORY OF EXACT SCIENCES			English	Article								In Philolaus' cosmology, the earth revolves around a central fire along with the other heavenly bodies, including a planet called the counter-earth which orbits below the earth. His theory can account for most astronomical phenomena. A common criticism of his theory since ancient times is that his counter-earth does no work in the system. Yet ancient sources say the planet was supposed to account for some lunar eclipses. A reconstruction of Philolaus' cosmology shows how lunar eclipses occurring at certain times of day cannot be explained by earth blocking the sun's light. The counter-earth could explain these eclipses.			daniel_graham@byu.edu						27	0	0	0	0	SPRINGER	NEW YORK	233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA	0003-9519	1432-0657		ARCH HIST EXACT SCI	Arch. Hist.

J	Rosso, R				Rosso, Riccardo			Felice Casorati's work on finite differences and its influence on Salvatore Pincherle	ARCHIVE FOR HISTORY OF EXACT SCIENCES			English	Article								This paper, which is mainly based on unpublished material, focuses on the scientific influence that Felice Casorati exerted on Salvatore Pincherle. This influence can be traced, in particular, in Casorati's work on the finite-difference calculus as conceived and published between 1879 and 1880 when Pincherle was living in Pavia. Casorati's work has an interesting back story related to his entry to the 1880 Grand Prix of the French Acad,mie des Sciences that helps us in understanding Casorati's personality. Moreover, the correspondence that Casorati exchanged with other mathematicians on his work reveals that some of the results contained in Casorati (Annali di Matematica pura ed applicata 10(S. II):10-45, 1880b) had been obtained-though in a narrower context-in an early paper by Christoffel. Finally, the letters between Casorati and Pincherle contain a short unpublished note by Pincherle on a paper by Jules Tannery (Ann Sci. l'A parts per thousand cole Norm Super 4(S. II):113-182, 1875). This note offers the first evidence of the influence of Casorati (Annali di Matematica pura ed applicata 10(S. II):10-45, 1880b) on Pincherle's work on the finite-difference calculus.

J	Guan, YZ				Guan, Yuzhen			Eclipse theory in the Jing chu li: Part I. The adoption of lunar velocity	ARCHIVE FOR HISTORY OF EXACT SCIENCES			English	Article								This paper investigates the methods of eclipse prediction in China before the fourth century AD, with a detailed example of the eclipse theory in the Jing chu li (Luminous Inception System ). As the official calendar of the Jin dynasty and the Kingdom Wei during the three kingdoms period, the Jing chu li was used for more than 200 years after it was adopted in 237 AD. From the San tong li (Triple Concordance System ) of the Western Han to the Jing chu li, methods for predicting eclipses developed in three important ways: (i) from predicting only lunar eclipses to the prediction of both solar and lunar eclipses; (ii) from relying only on the mean periods of the sun and the moon to taking into consideration the variation in lunar velocity; and (iii) from estimating only a rough date to predicting the exact time of eclipses. This paper addresses two questions: first, how did ancient Chinese astronomers use cycles to predict eclipses in the Han dynasty? Second, how did astronomers such as Liu Hong and Yang Wei revise early eclipse prediction methods? The original text of the Jing chu li is analyzed to show how Yang Wei combined lunar velocity theory with the traditional method of predicting eclipses using cycles.

J	Rodriguez, L				Rodriguez, Laura			Frigyes Riesz and the emergence of general topology The roots of 'topological space' in geometry	ARCHIVE FOR HISTORY OF EXACT SCIENCES			English	Article							NONMETRICAL ANALYSIS SITUS; SETS; PROXIMITY; ARTICLES; THEOREM; NOTION; CURVES; LIMITS; ORDER	In 1906, Frigyes Riesz introduced a preliminary version of the notion of a topological space. He called it a mathematical continuum. This development can be traced back to the end of 1904 when, genuinely interested in taking up Hilbert's foundations of geometry from 1902, Riesz aimed to extend Hilbert's notion of a two-dimensional manifold to the three-dimensional case. Starting with the plane as an abstract point-set, Hilbert had postulated the existence of a system of neighbourhoods, thereby introducing the notion of an accumulation point for the point-sets of the plane. Inspired by Hilbert's technical approach, as well as by recent developments in analysis and point-set topology in France, Riesz defined the concept of a mathematical continuum as an abstract set provided with a notion of an accumulation point. In addition, he developed further elementary concepts in abstract point-set topology. Taking an abstract topological approach, he formulated a concept of three-dimensional continuous space that resembles the modern concept of a three-dimensional topological manifold. In 1908, Riesz presented his concept of mathematical continuum at the International Congress of Mathematicians in Rome. His lecture immediately won the attention of people interested in carrying on his research. They promoted his ideas, thus assuring their gradual reception by several future founders of general topology. In this way, Riesz's work contributed significantly to the emergence of this discipline.
