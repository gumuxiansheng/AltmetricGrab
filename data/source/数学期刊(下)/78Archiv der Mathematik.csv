Then using the metric resolvents of maximal monotone operators and the metric projections, we prove a strong convergence theorem for finding a solution of the split common null point problem in Banach spaces. The result of this paper seems to be the first one to study it outside Hilbert spaces.

Haynsworth's result was improved by Hartfiel (Proc Am Math Soc 41:463-465, 1973).

J	Ouhabaz, E				Ouhabaz, El Maati			Maximal regularity for non-autonomous evolution equations governed by forms having less regularity	ARCHIV DER MATHEMATIK			English	Article						Maximal regularity; Sesquilinear forms; Non-autonomous evolution equations; Differential operators with boundary conditions		We consider the maximal regularity problem for non-autonomous evolution equations u' (t) + A(t) u(t) = f(t), t is an element of (0, tau] u(0) = u(0). Each operator A(t) is associated with a sesquilinear form a(t) on a Hilbert space H. We assume that these forms all have the same domain V. It is proved in Haak and Ouhabaz (Math Ann, doi: 10.1007/s00208-015-1199-7, 2015) that if the forms have some regularity with respect to t (e.g., piecewise alpha-Holder continuous for some alpha > 1/2) then the above problem has maximal L-p-regularity for all u(0) in the real-interpolation space (H, D(A(0)))(1-1/p),(p). In this paper we prove that the regularity required there can be improved for a class of sesquilinear forms. The forms considered here are such that the difference a(t;.,.) - a(s;.,.) is continuous on a larger space than the common domain V. We give three examples which illustrate our results.

J	Araujo, G; Pellegrino, D				Araujo, Gustavo; Pellegrino, Daniel			Optimal Hardy-Littlewood type inequalities for m-linear forms on spaces with on l(p) spaces with 1 <= p <= m	ARCHIV DER MATHEMATIK			English	Article						Bohnenblust-Hille inequality; Hardy-Littlewood inequality; Absolutely summing operators	BOHNENBLUST-HILLE INEQUALITY; CONSTANTS; BOUNDS	The Hardy-Littlewood inequalities for m-linear forms on l(p) spaces are stated for p > m. In this paper, among other results, we investigate similar results for 1 <= p <= m. Let K be R or C and m >= 2 be a positive integer. Our main results are the following sharp inequalities: i) If (r, p) is an element of ([1, 2] x [2, 2m)) boolean OR ([1,infinity) x [2m,infinity]), then there is a positive constant D-m,r,p(K) (not depending on n) such that (Sigma(n)(j1 ,..., jm = 1) vertical bar T(e(j1) ,..., e(jm))vertical bar(r))(1/r) <= D(m,r,p)(K)n(max{2mr+2mp-mpr-pr/2pr}) parallel to T parallel to for all m-linear forms T : l(p)(n) x ... x l(p)(n) -> K and all positive integers n. ii) If (r, p) is an element of [2,8) x (m, 2m], then (Sigma(n)(j1 ,..., jm = 1) vertical bar T(e(j1) ,..., e(jm))vertical bar(r))(1/r) <= (root 2)(m-1) n(max{p+mr-rp/pr,0}) parallel to T parallel to for all m-linear forms T : l(p)(n) x ... x l(p)(n) -> K and all positive integers n. Moreover, the exponents max{(2mr + 2mp - mpr - pr)/ 2pr, 0} in (i) and max{(p + mr - rp)/ pr, 0} in (ii) are optimal. The cases (r, p) = (2m/ (m + 1), infinity) and (r, p) = (2mp/ (mp + p - 2m),p) for p >= 2m and (r, p) = (p/ (p - m), p) for m < p < 2m recover the classical Bohnenblust-Hille and Hardy-Littlewood inequalities.

In an earlier work, the second author with Sengupta proved that two cusp forms of different (integral) weights with real algebraic Fourier coefficients have infinitely many Fourier coefficients of the same as well as opposite sign, up to the action of a Galois automorphism. In the first part, we strengthen their result by doing away with the dependency on the Galois conjugacy. In fact, we extend their result to cusp forms with arbitrary real Fourier coefficients. Next we consider simultaneous sign change at prime powers of Fourier coefficients of two integral weight Hecke eigenforms which are newforms. Finally, we consider an analogous question for Fourier coefficients of two half-integral weight Hecke eigenforms.

We apply this result to study the continuity of the convolution product on the dual LUC(G)* of the space of bounded left uniformly continuous functions with the topology of uniform convergence on bounded uniformly equicontinuous sets. When restricted to the space of finite Radon measures on a locally compact group, this is the right multiplier topology. For any topological group, the convolution is jointly continuous on bounded sets in the measure algebra. It is jointly continuous on all of LUC(G)* when G is a locally compact SIN group.

Subgroup conjugacy separability of free-by-finite groups	ARCHIV DER MATHEMATIK			English	Article						Subgroup conjugacy separability; Conjugacy separability	POLYCYCLIC GROUPS	A group G is said to be conjugacy subgroup separable if for every pair of non-conjugate finitely generated subgroups H and K of G, there exists a finite quotient of G where the images of these subgroups are not conjugate. The notion was introduced recently by O. Bogopolski and F. Grunewald. We prove here that finitely generated free-by-finite groups are subgroup conjugacy separable. This generalizes Theorem 1.5 in Bogopolski and Grunewald (On subgroup conjugacy separability in the class of virtually free groups, vol 110, 18 pages, 2010). We also show that free products preserve subgroup conjugacy separability. The methods are based on the profinite version of Bass-Serre's theory of groups acting on trees. In particular, we use essentially the results of Ribes and Zalesskii (Rev Mat Iberoam 30:165-190, 2014).	[Chagas, S. C.; Zalesskii, P.

Furthermore, in this ambient space, a homogeneous real hypersurface M is minimal if and only if it is ruled. This fact implies that it is interesting to study this minimal homogeneous real hypersurface from the viewpoint of the geometry of ruled real hypersurfaces. It is known that the shape operator A of every ruled real hypersurface M is given by the characteristic field and the vector field U. The purpose of this paper is to characterize this minimal homogeneous real hypersurface in in the class of all ruled real hypersurfaces M by investigating the first curvature of all integral curves of the vector fields and U. Note that there exist minimal non-homogeneous ruled real hypersurfaces in (see Geom Dedicata 79:267-286, 1999; Hokkaido Math J 43:1-14, 2014).

If two-generated, they are the family H (n) (for all n a parts per thousand yen 3), which for suitable n arise from schemes defined by affine planes of order n - 1. Otherwise, the basis involutions correspond to the points of a finite projective space whose incidence geometry determines the algebra multiplication. This generalizes to table algebras a previous result of van Dam for association schemes. An algebraic characterization is also given.

J	Keem, C; Martens, G				Keem, Changho; Martens, Gerriet			The gonality sequence of covering curves	ARCHIV DER MATHEMATIK			English	Article						Gonality sequence; Covering curves	SURFACES	According to Kato and Martens (Arch Math 103:111-116, 2014), the gonality sequence of a curve X of genus g which doubly covers a curve Y of genus h > 0 is completely determined by the gonality sequence of the covered curve Y provided that g is sufficiently large w.r.t. h. In this paper we study how far this result can be extended to a covering X/Y of degree m > 2. It turns out that it is useful for this question to introduce the notion of irrational gonality of X, and we will show that for prime m or if m is the irrational gonality of X several results valid for m = 2 remain true. The best results are obtained for m = 3; in particular, the case of "tri-elliptic" X (i.e. m = 3, h = 1) is extensively worked out.

Characterizations of inner product spaces involving homogeneity of isosceles orthogonality	ARCHIV DER MATHEMATIK			English	Article						Angular distance; Characterization of inner product spaces; Homogeneity of isosceles orthogonality; Minkowski plane; Normed linear space		In this paper by using the notion of homogeneity property of the isosceles orthogonality, we derive some characterizations of inner product spaces. We also prove that a weakened hypothesis of the homogeneity of the isosceles orthogonality and a weakened reformulation of the Ficken characterization can still characterize inner product spaces.

J	Hug, D; Schneider, R				Hug, Daniel; Schneider, Rolf			Holder continuity for support measures of convex bodies	ARCHIV DER MATHEMATIK			English	Article						Support measure; Curvature measure; Area measure; Weak convergence; Holder continuity; Stability		The support measures of a convex body are a common generalization of the curvature measures and the area measures. With respect to the Hausdorff metric on the space of convex bodies, they are weakly continuous. We provide a quantitative improvement of this result by establishing a Holder estimate for the support measures in terms of the bounded Lipschitz metric which metrizes the weak convergence. Specializing the result to area measures yields a reverse counterpart to earlier stability estimates, concerning Minkowski's existence theorem for convex bodies with given area measure.

The -property is a subgroup embedding property of arithmetical character introduced in Li (J.

A version of the proof by Oja deals with the weak metric AP of the original space X and uses lifting techniques to return to the dual space. We streamline this proof, eliminating the need to enter the original space and show that the only essential component of the proof is Oja's "RNP impact lemma". We express the weak metric AP and notions of a similar kind in a concise language of systems of seminorms on operator spaces and provide results in the general setting of convex APs.

Several applications are presented; some of them in the multilinear framework and some in a completely nonlinear setting. In a final section, we investigate the size of the set of non uniformly dominated sets of linear operators under the point of view of lineability.

At first, we give a necessary and sufficient condition for G-BSDEs under which the one-dimensional Jensen inequality holds. Second, we prove that for n > 1, the n-dimensional Jensen inequality holds for any nonlinear expectation if and only if the nonlinear expectation is linear, which is essentially due to Jia (Arch Math 94:489-499, 2010). As a consequence, we give a necessary and sufficient condition for G-BSDEs under which the n-dimensional Jensen inequality holds.

Also, we present the semigroup related to Blackwell's example (Ann Math Statist 29:313-316, 1958) as an infinite product of commuting Markov semigroups. Intriguingly, it is hard to find a manageable description of the generator of this semigroup. As a result, it is much easier to prove the existence of the infinite product involved by direct argument than it is to do this using the Trotter-Kato-Sova-Kurtz-Hasegawa theory.
