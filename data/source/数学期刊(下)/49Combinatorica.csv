MANY NON-EQUIVALENT REALIZATIONS OF THE ASSOCIAHEDRON	COMBINATORICA			English	Article							GENERALIZED ASSOCIAHEDRA; SORTABLE ELEMENTS; POLYTOPE	Hohlweg and Lange (2007) and Santos (2004, unpublished) have found two different ways of constructing exponential families of realizations of the n-dimensional associahedron with normal vectors in {0, +/- 1}(n), generalizing the constructions of Loday (2004) and Chapoton-Fomin-Zelevinsky (2002). We classify the associahedra obtained by these constructions modulo linear equivalence of their normal fans and show, in particular, that the only realization that can be obtained with both methods is the Chapoton-Fomin-Zelevinsky (2002) associahedron. For the Hohlweg-Lange associahedra our classification is a priori coarser than the classification up to isometry of normal fans, by Bergeron-Hohlweg-Lange-Thomas (2009). However, both yield the same classes. As a consequence, we get that two Hohlweg-Lange associahedra have linearly equivalent normal fans if and only if they are isometric. The Santos construction, which produces an even larger family of associahedra, appears here in print for the first time. Apart of describing it in detail we relate it with the c-cluster complexes and the denominator fans in cluster algebras of type A. A third classical construction of the associahedron, as the secondary polytope of a convex n-gon (Gelfand-Kapranov-Zelevinsky, 1990), is shown to never produce a normal fan linearly equivalent to any of the other two constructions.

We show that for a Benjamini-Schramm convergent sequence of finite graphs, the chromatic measures converge in holomorphic moments. As a corollary, for a convergent sequence of finite graphs, we prove that the normalized log of the chromatic polynomial converges to an analytic function outside a bounded disc. This generalizes a recent result of Borgs, Chayes, Kahn and Lovasz, who proved convergence at large enough positive integers and answers a question of Borgs. Our methods also lead to explicit estimates on the number of proper colorings of graphs with large girth.

ON THE NUMBER OF MATROIDS	COMBINATORICA			English	Article							CONSTANT WEIGHT CODES	We consider the problem of determining m, the number of matroids on n elements. The best known lower bound on m is due to Knuth (1974) who showed that log log m is at least n - 3/2 log n - O(1). On the other hand, Piff (1973) showed that log log m <= n log n + log log n + O(1), and it has been conjectured since that the right answer is perhaps closer to Knuth's bound. We show that this is indeed the case, and prove an upper bound on log log m that is within an additive 1+0(1) term of Knuth's lower bound. Our proof is based on using some structural properties of non-bases in a matroid together with some properties of stable sets in the Johnson graph to give a compressed representation of matroids.

A refinement of a result of Corradi and Hajnal	COMBINATORICA			English	Article							MAXIMUM DEGREE; GRAPHS; THEOREM	Corradi and Hajnal proved that for every k a parts per thousand yen 1 and n a parts per thousand yen 3k, every n-vertex graph with minimum degree at least 2k contains k vertex-disjoint cycles. This implies that every 3k-vertex graph with maximum degree at most k - 1 has an equitable k-coloring. We prove that for sa{3,4} if an sk-vertex graph G with maximum degree at most k has no equitable k-coloring, then G either contains K (k+1) or k is odd and G contains K (k,k) . This refines the above corollary of the Corradi-Hajnal Theorem and also is a step toward the conjecture by Chen, Lih, and Wu that for r a parts per thousand yen 3, the only connected graphs with maximum degree at most r that are not equitably r-colorable are K (r,r) (for odd r) and K (r+1).

J	Soberon, P				Soberon, Pablo			Equal coefficients and tolerance in coloured Tverberg partitions	COMBINATORICA			English	Article							THEOREM; CONJECTURE; NUMBER; COMPLEXES	The coloured Tverberg theorem was conjectured by Barany, Lovasz and Furedi [4] and asks whether for any d+1 sets (considered as colour classes) of k points each in a"e (d) there is a partition of them into k colourful sets whose convex hulls intersect. This is known when d=1;2 [5] or k+1 is prime [7]. In this paper we show that (k-1)d+1 colour classes are necessary and sufficient if the coefficients in the convex combination in the colourful sets are required to be the same in each class. This result is actually a generalisation of Tverberg's classic theorem on the intersection of convex hulls [27]. We also examine what happens if we want the convex hulls of the colourful sets to intersect even if we remove any r of the colour classes, and its relation to other colourful variants of Tverberg's theorem. We investigate the relation of the case k=2 and the Gale transform, obtaining a variation of the coloured Radon theorem. We then show applications of these results to purely combinatorial problems.

J	Shapira, A; Sudakov, B				Shapira, Asaf; Sudakov, Benny			Small complete minors above the extremal edge density	COMBINATORICA			English	Article							GRAPHS	A fundamental result of Mader from 1972 asserts that a graph of high average degree contains a highly connected subgraph with roughly the same average degree. We prove a lemma showing that one can strengthen Mader's result by replacing the notion of high connectivity by the notion of vertex expansion. Another well known result in graph theory states that for every integer t there is a smallest real c(t), such that every n-vertex graph with c(t) n edges contains a K (t) -minor. Fiorini, Joret, Theis and Wood asked whether every n-vertex graph G that has at least (c(t)+epsilon)n edges, must contain a K (t) -minor of order at most C(epsilon) logn. We use our extension of Mader's theorem to prove that such a graph G must contain a K (t) -minor of order at most C(epsilon) lognlognlogn. Known constructions of graphs with high girth show that this result is tight up to the log logn factor.

J	Viola, E				Viola, Emanuele			The communication complexity of addition	COMBINATORICA			English	Article							CONSTANT-DEPTH CIRCUITS; PSEUDORANDOM FUNCTIONS; CONSTRUCTIONS; POLYNOMIALS; MAJORITY; PROOFS; SPACES; GATES; BITS	Suppose each of ka parts per thousand currency signn (o(1)) players holds an n-bit number x (i) in its hand. The players wish to determine if a (ia parts per thousand currency signk) x (i) =s. We give a public-coin protocol with error 1% and communication O(k logk). The communication bound is independent of n, and for ka parts per thousand yen3 improves on the O(k logn) bound by Nisan (Bolyai Soc. Math. Studies; 1993). Our protocol also applies to addition modulo m. In this case we give a matching (public-coin) Omega(k logk) lower bound for various m. We also obtain some lower bounds over the integers, including Omega (k log logk) for protocols that are one-way, like ours. We give a protocol to determine if ax (i) > s with error 1% and communication O(k logk) log n. For ka parts per thousand yen3 this improves on Nisan's O(k log(2) n) bound. A similar improvement holds for computing degree-(k-1) polynomial-threshold functions in the number-on-forehead model. We give a (public-coin, 2-player, tight) Omega(logn) lower bound to determine if x (1) > x (2). This improves on the Omega(aelogn) bound by Smirnov (1988). Troy Lee informed us in January 2013 that an Omega(logn) lower bound may also be obtained by combining a result in learning theory by Forster et al. (2003) with a result by Linial and Shraibman (2009). As an application, we show that polynomial-size AC(0) circuits augmented with O(1) threshold (or symmetric) gates cannot compute cryptographic pseudorandom functions, extending the result about AC(0) by Linial, Mansour, and Nisan (J. ACM; 1993).

J	Iosevich, A; Rudnev, M; Zhai, YJ				Iosevich, Alex; Rudnev, Misha; Zhai, Yujia			AREAS OF TRIANGLES AND BECK'S THEOREM IN PLANES OVER FINITE FIELDS	COMBINATORICA			English	Article							SUM-PRODUCT ESTIMATE; POINTS; SETS	The first main result of this paper establishes that any sufficiently large subset of a plane over the finite field F-q, namely any set E subset of F-q(2) of cardinality vertical bar E vertical bar > q, determines at least q-1/2 distinct areas of triangles. Moreover, one can find such triangles sharing a common base in E, and hence a common vertex. However, we stop short of being able to tell how "typical" an element of E such a vertex may be. It is also shown that, under a more stringent condition vertical bar E vertical bar = Omega(q log q), there are at least q - o (q) distinct areas of triangles sharing a common vertex z, this property shared by a positive proportion of z is an element of E. This comes as an application of the second main result of the paper, which is a finite field version of the Beck theorem for large subsets of F-q(2). Namely, if vertical bar E vertical bar = Omega(q log q), then a positive proportion of points z is an element of E has a property that there are Omega(q) straight lines incident to z, each supporting, up to constant factors, approximately the expected number vertical bar E vertical bar/q of points of E, other than z. This is proved by combining combinatorial and Fourier analytic techniques. A counterexample in [14] shows that this cannot be true for every z is an element of E; unless vertical bar E vertical bar = Omega(q(3/2)). We also briefly discuss higher-dimensional implications of these results in light of some recent developments in the literature.

Four years later, Bollobas and ErdAs gave a surprising geometric construction, utilizing the isoperimetric inequality for the high dimensional sphere, of a K (4)-free graph on n vertices with independence number o(n) and edges. Starting with Bollobas and ErdAs in 1976, several problems have been asked on estimating the minimum possible independence number in the critical window, when the number of edges is about n (2)/8. These problems have received considerable attention and remained one of the main open problems in this area. In this paper, we give nearly best-possible bounds, solving the various open problems concerning this critical window.

Robertson and Seymour's graph minor project gives rise to a polynomial time algorithm for this problem for any fixed k, but their proof of the correctness needs the whole Graph Minor project. We give a faster algorithm and a much simpler proof of the correctness for the edge-disjoint paths problem. Our results can be summarized as follows: If an input graph is either 4-edge-connected or Eulerian, then our algorithm only needs to look for the following three simple reductions: (i) Excluding vertices of high degree. (ii) Excluding a parts per thousand currency sign3-edge-cuts. (iii) Excluding large clique minors. When an input graph is either 4-edge-connected or Eulerian, the number of terminals k is allowed to be a non-trivially super constant number, up to k=O((log log logn)(A1/2-epsilon) ) for any epsilon > 0. In addition, if an input graph is either 4-edge-connected planar or Eulerian planar, k is allowed to be O((logn (A1/2-epsilon) ) for any epsilon > 0. We also give our own algorithm for the edge-disjoint paths problem in general graphs. We basically follow the Robertson-Seymour's algorithm, but we cut half of the proof of the correctness for their algorithm. In addition, our algorithm is faster than Robertson and Seymour's.

This conjecture is still open. We consider a variant of the conjecture, where instead of excluding H as an induced subgraph, both H and H (c) are excluded. We prove this modified conjecture for the case when H is the five-edge path. Our second main result is an asymmetric version of this: we prove that for every graph G such that G contains no induced six-edge path, and G (c) contains no induced four-edge path, G contains a polynomial-size clique or stable set.

First, locally finite highly arc-transitive digraphs with universal reachability relation are presented. Second, constructions of two-ended highly arc-transitive digraphs are provided, where each 'building block' is a finite bipartite digraph that is not a disjoint union of complete bipartite digraphs. Both of these were conjectured impossible in the above-mentioned paper. We also describe the structure of two-ended highly arc-transitive digraphs in more generality, heading towards a characterization of such digraphs.

We say that G is k-critical if chi(G)=k and chi(H) < k for every proper subgraph H subset of G. Over the years, many properties of k-critical graphs have been discovered, including improved upper and lower bounds for parallel to G parallel to, the number of edges in a k-critical graph, as a function of vertical bar G vertical bar, the number of vertices. In this note, we analyze this edge density problem for directed graphs, where the chromatic number chi(D) of a digraph D is defined to be the fewest number of colours needed to colour the vertices of D so that each colour class induces an acyclic subgraph. For each k >= 3, we construct an infinite family of sparse k-critical digraphs for which parallel to D parallel to < (k(2)-k+1/2)vertical bar D vertical bar and an infinite family of dense k-critical digraphs for which parallel to D parallel to > (1/2 - 1/2(k-1))vertical bar D vertical bar(2). One corollary of our results is an explicit construction of an infinite family of k-critical digraphs of digirth l, for any pair of integers k,1 >= 3. This extends a result by Bokal et al. who used a probabilistic approach to demonstrate the existence of one such digraph.

INTEGRAL REPRESENTATION OF CERTAIN COMBINATORIAL RECURRENCES	COMBINATORICA			English	Article								Many recurrences that occur in combinatorics incorporate linear and self-convolutive terms. The generating function associated to these is usually not well defined because it has zero radius of convergence. However, the sequence may be identifiable as the asymptotic expansion of a function, and then contour integration can be applied to obtain an expression as the moment sequence of a (possibly signed) measure. We find examples that in combinatorics are all connected with permutations, and whose generating functions are related to the exponential integral function.

J	Bosek, B; Krawczyk, T				Bosek, Bartlomiej; Krawczyk, Tomasz			A subexponential upper bound for the on-line chain partitioning problem	COMBINATORICA			English	Article							LONG INCOMPARABLE CHAINS; 1ST-FIT; POSETS; ORDERS	The main question in the on-line chain partitioning problem is to decide whether there exists an on-line algorithm that partitions posets of width at most w into polynomial number of chains - see Trotter's chapter Partially ordered sets in the Handbook of Combinatorics. So far the best known on-line algorithm of Kierstead used at most (5 (w) - 1)/4 chains; on the other hand Szemer,di proved that any on-line algorithm requires at least chains. These results were obtained in the early eighties and since then no progress in the general case has been done. We provide an on-line algorithm that partitions posets of width w into at most w (13logw) chains. This yields the first subexponential upper bound for the on-line chain partitioning problem.

J	Ergun, F; Jowhari, H				Ergun, Funda; Jowhari, Hossein			On the monotonicity of a data stream	COMBINATORICA			English	Article							LONGEST INCREASING SUBSEQUENCE; BOUNDS	In this paper we consider problems related to the sortedness of a data stream. In the first part of this work, we investigate the problem of estimating the distance to monotonicity; given a finite stream of length n from alphabet {1,...,m}, we give a deterministic (2+N")-approximation algorithm for estimating its distance to monotonicity in space . This improves over the previous randomized (4+N")-approximation algorithm due to Gopalan, Jayram, Krauthgamer and Kumar in SODA 2007. We then consider the problem of approximating the length of the longest increasing subsequence of the input stream. Through the analysis of a multi-party communication game, we prove that deterministic streaming algorithms that approximate the length of the longest increasing subsequence within 1+N" factor require bits of space for any N" in the range (1/n, 1/6]. This bound matches the upper bound given in the work of Gopalan et al. within a log factor. We note that, independent of our work and via a different proof strategy, Gal and Gopalan has shown an lower bound for all N"a parts per thousand yen1/n including Omega(1) ranges.

A graph is called reduced if it has no isolated vertices and no two vertices with the same set of neighbors. Akbari, Cameron, and Khosrovshahi conjectured that the number of vertices of every reduced graph of rank r is at most m(r)=2((r+2)/2)-2 if r is even and m(r)=5 center dot 2((r-3)/2)-2 if r is odd. In this article, we prove that if the conjecture is not true, then there would be a counterexample of rank at most 46. We also show that every reduced graph of rank r has at most 8m(r)+14 vertices.

J	Richter, RB; Rooney, B				Richter, R. Bruce; Rooney, Brendan			Embedding a graph-like continuum in a surface	COMBINATORICA			English	Article							CYCLE SPACE; THEOREM; FINITE	Graph-like continua provide a very natural setting for generalizing finite graphs to infinite, compact structures. For example, the Freudenthal compactification of a locally finite graph, exploited by Diestel and his students in their study of the cycle space of an infinite graph, is an example of a graph-like continuum. Generalizing earlier works in special cases, the authors, along with Christian, have proved MacLane's and Whitney's characterizations of planarity for graph-like continua (Electron. J. Combin. 17 (2010)). In this work, we consider embeddings of graph-like continua in compact surfaces and show that: (i) every edge is in an open disc that meets the graph-like continuum precisely in that edge; (ii) there are natural analogues of face boundary walks; (iii) there is a graph-like continuum triangulating the same surface and containing as a sub-graphlike continuum the original embedded graph-like continuum; (iv) the face boundaries generate a subspace of the cycle space; and (v) the quotient of the cycle space by the boundary cycles is the homology of the surface. These all generalize results known for embeddings of finite graphs.	[Richter, R.

A QUANTITATIVE GIBBARD-SATTERTHWAITE THEOREM WITHOUT NEUTRALITY	COMBINATORICA			English	Article							SOCIAL-WELFARE; MANIPULATION; DIFFICULTY	Recently, quantitative versions of the Gibbard-Satterthwaite theorem were proven for k= 3 alternatives by Friedgut, Kalai, Keller and Nisan and for neutral functions on k >= 4 alternatives by Isaksson, Kindler and Mossel. We prove a quantitative version of the Gibbard-Satterthwaite theorem for general social choice functions for any number k >= 3 of alternatives. In particular we show that for a social choice function f on k >= 3 alternatives and n voters, which is s-far from the family of nonmanipulable functions, a uniformly chosen voter profile is manipulable with probability at least inverse polynomial in n, k, and 5-1. Ours is a unified proof which in particular covers all previous cases established before. The proof crucially uses reverse hypercontractivity in addition to several ideas from the two previous proofs. Much of the work is devoted to understanding functions of a single voter, and in particular we also prove a quantitative Gibbard-Satterthwaite theorem for one voter.
