The iterative algorithm presented in this paper is shown to possess strong convergence for the split common fixed point problem of asymptotically nonexpansive mappings although the mappings do not have semi-compactness. Our results improve and develop previous methods for solving the split common fixed point problem.

As a consequence, we obtain a new nonmatrix convergence method, namely f-statistical convergence of order a or S-alpha(f)-convergence, which is intermediate between the ordinary convergence and the statistical convergence of order alpha. We also introduce a new concept of strong Cesaro summability of order a with respect to a modulus function f, and finally we investigate the relationship between the set S-alpha(f) of all f-statistically convergent sequences of order alpha and the set W-alpha(f) of all strongly Cesaro summable sequences of order alpha with respect to f	[Bhardwaj, Vinod K.] Kurukshetra Univ, Dept Math, Kurukshetra 136119, Haryana, India; [Dhawan, Shweta] KVA DAV Coll Women, Dept Math, Karnal 132001, Haryana, India	Bhardwaj, VK (reprint author), Kurukshetra Univ, Dept Math, Kurukshetra 136119, Haryana, India.	vinodk_bhj@rediffmail.com						37	14	14	0	0	SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG	CHAM	GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND	1029-242X			J INEQUAL APPL	J.

On the convergence of high-order Ehrlich-type iterative methods for approximating all zeros of a polynomial simultaneously	JOURNAL OF INEQUALITIES AND APPLICATIONS			English	Article						simultaneous methods; Ehrlich method; polynomial zeros; accelerated convergence; local convergence; semilocal convergence; error estimates		We study a family of high-order Ehrlich-type methods for approximating all zeros of a polynomial simultaneously. Let us denote by T-(1) the famous Ehrlich method (1967). Starting from T-(1), Kjurkchiev and Andreev (1987) have introduced recursively a sequence (T-(N))(N=1)(infinity) of iterative methods for simultaneous finding polynomial zeros. For given N >= 1, the Ehrlich-type method T-(N) has the order of convergence 2N + 1. In this paper, we establish two new local convergence theorems as well as a semilocal convergence theorem (under computationally verifiable initial conditions and with an a posteriori error estimate) for the Ehrlich-type methods T-(N). Our first local convergence theorem generalizes a result of Proinov (2015) and improves the result of Kjurkchiev and Andreev (1987). The second local convergence theorem generalizes another recent result of Proinov (2015), but only in the case of the maximum norm. Our semilocal convergence theorem is the first result in this direction.

In the case when b is an element of LCp,lambda{x0} is a local Campanato spaces, 1 <p < infinity, and T-Omega,T-b be is a sublinear commutator operator, we find the sufficient conditions on the pair (phi(1),phi(2)) which ensures the boundedness of the operator T-Omega,T-b, from one generalized local Morrey space LMp,phi 1{x0} to another LMp,phi 2{x0}. In all cases the conditions for the boundedness of T-Omega are given in terms of Zygmund-type integral inequalities on (phi(1), phi(2)), which do not make any assumptions on the monotonicity of phi(1), phi(2) in r. Conditions of these theorems are satisfied by many important operators in analysis, in particular pseudo-differential operators, Littlewood-Paley operators, Marcinkiewicz operators, and Bochner-Riesz operators.

Such an estimate can be useful to provide error bounds for certain approximations in L-p, or in Orlicz spaces, where convex modular functionals are often involved. Estimates for the case of C-2 functions, as well as for merely Lipschitz continuous convex functions phi, are established. Some examples are given to illustrate how sharp our results are, and a comparison is made with some other estimates existing in the literature. Finally, some applications involving the Gamma function are obtained.

Under appropriate assumptions, we prove that the proposed algorithms converge strongly to a common element of the fixed point set of a strict pseudocontractive mapping, a solution set of finitely many generalized mixed equilibrium problems, a solution set of finitely many variational inclusions, and a solution set of a general system of variational inequalities. Such an element is a unique solution of a triple hierarchical variational inequality problem. In addition, we also consider as an application the proposed algorithm to solve a hierarchical variational inequality problem defined over the set of common solutions of finitely many generalized mixed equilibrium problems, finitely many variational inclusions, and a general system of variational inequalities. The results obtained in this paper improve and extend the corresponding results announced by many other authors.

Further, we obtain local/global bounds for the solution of set-valued mixed quasi-variational inequality problems in terms of the residual gap function, the regularized gap function, and the D-gap function. The results obtained in this paper are generalization and refinement of previously known results for some class of variational inequality problems.

Our main motivation is to extend the connotation of the analysis of variance and facilitate its applications in probability, statistics and higher education. To this end, we first introduce the relevant concepts and properties of the interval function. Next, we study several characteristics of the log-concave function and prove an interesting quasi-log concavity conjecture. Next, we introduce the theory of I center dot-Jensen variance and study the monotonicity of the interval function by means of the log concavity. Finally, we demonstrate the applications of our results in higher education, show that the hierarchical teaching model is 'normally' better than the traditional teaching model under the appropriate hypotheses, and study the monotonicity of the interval function .

Furthermore, we give four equivalent conditions on the n-dimensional Jensen inequality for g-evaluations induced by backward stochastic differential equations with non-uniform Lipschitz coefficients in L-p(Omega, F, (F-t)(0 <= t <= T), P) (1 < p <= 2). Finally, we give a sufficient condition on g that satisfies the non-uniform Lipschitz condition under which Holder's inequality and Minkowski's inequality for the corresponding g-evaluation hold true.

The convergent self-mappings under consideration satisfy conditions of either uniform or point-wise convergence, in a probabilistic sense, to a self-mapping on the same abstract space of the considered probabilistic metric space. Furthermore, the self-mappings of the considered sequence satisfy a probabilistic phi-contractive condition which is based on the use of a control phi-function.

By using the Lyapunov function, the stochastic analysis technique and the generalized Halanay inequality, some novel sufficient conditions on pth moment exponential stability of stochastic differential equations with Markovian switching and time-varying delay are derived. The results obtained in this paper are completely new and modify and improve some known results. Moreover, two numerical examples are also provided to demonstrate the effectiveness and applicability of the theoretical results. The aim of this paper is to investigate pth moment exponential stability of general nonlinear stochastic differential equations with Markovian switching and time-varying delay.

However, in many practical applications, one does not know whether the density function is smooth or not. It makes sense to consider the mean L-p-consistency of the wavelet estimators for f is an element of L-p (1 <= p <= infinity). In this paper, the authors will construct wavelet estimators and analyze their L-p(R) performance. They prove that, under mild conditions on the family of wavelets, the estimators are shown to be L-p (1 <= p <= infinity)-consistent for both noiseless and additive noise models.

Let, moreover, S be a nonempty subset of {0, 1, ... ,n - 1}.

J	Ozbilge, E; Demir, A				Ozbilge, Ebru; Demir, Ali			Inverse problem for a time-fractional parabolic equation	JOURNAL OF INEQUALITIES AND APPLICATIONS			English	Article							UNKNOWN DIFFUSION-COEFFICIENT; SEMIGROUP APPROACH; IDENTIFICATION	This article deals with the mathematical analysis of the inverse coefficient problem of identifying the unknown coefficient k(x) in the linear time-fractional parabolic equation D-t(alpha) u(x,t) = (k(x)u(x))(x) + qu(x)(x,t) + p(t)u(x,t), 0 <= alpha <= 1, with mixed boundary conditions k(0)u(x)(0,t) = psi(0)(t), u(1,t) = psi(1)(t). By defining the input-output mappings Phi[.] : K -> C[0, T] and psi [.] : K -> C-1[0,T] the inverse problem is reduced to the problem of their invertibility. Hence the main purpose of this study is to investigate the distinguishability of the input-output mappings Phi[.] and psi[.]. This work shows that the input-output mappings Phi[.] and psi[.] have distinguishability property. Moreover, the value k(1) of the unknown diffusion coefficient k(x) at x = 1 can be determined explicitly by making use of measured output data (boundary observation) k(1)u(x)(1, t) = h(t), which brings about a greater restriction on the set of admissible coefficients. It is also shown that the measured output data f (t) and h(t) can be determined analytically by a series representation. Hence the input-output mappings Phi[.] : K -> C[0, T] and psi [.] : K -> C-1[0, T] can be described explicitly, where Phi[k] = u(x,t;k)|(x=0) and psi[k] = k(x)u(x)(x,t;k)vertical bar(x=1).

The bi-level optimization problem is reformulated as a mathematical programming problem with complementarity constraints (MPCC), which fails to satisfy the Mangasarian-Fromovitz constraint qualification (MFCQ). We adopt a smoothing approach to overcome the lack of constraint qualifications in the MPCC problem. Under mild conditions, it has been proven that the sequence of the global optimal solutions generated by solving corresponding smoothing subproblems converges to one optimal solution of the original MPCC problem. Numerical experiments show that the proposed method is practical in solving user equilibrium transportation problems with capacity expansion combining road toll pricing.

As a discretization of the regularization method, we propose an iterative method. We then prove that the proposed iterative method converges in norm to a solution of the class of monotone variational inequalities. We also apply our results to the constrained minimization problem and the minimum-norm fixed point problem for a generalized Lipschitz continuous and pseudocontractive mapping.

In this paper, we study warped product submanifolds of nearly cosymplectic manifolds in which the base manifold is slant and thus we derive a sharp relation for the squared norm of the second fundamental form.

The methods are based on degree reducing the center and radius curves using G(k)-continuity and minimizing the corresponding errors. Some examples and comparisons are given to illustrate the efficiency and simplicity of the proposed methods. The examples show that by using our proposed methods, we get G(0)-, and G(1)-degree reductions, while having less errors than existing methods, which are without any continuity conditions.

In this paper, we focus on designing a new primal-dual algorithm for the SPCP problem with nonnegative constraint. Our method is based on the framework of proximal point algorithm. By taking full exploitation to the special structure of the SPCP problem, the method enjoys the advantage of being easily implementable. Global convergence result is established for the proposed method. Preliminary numerical results demonstrate that the method is efficient.

They are based on the two-term PRP method proposed by Cheng (Numer. Funct. Anal. Optim. 28:1217-1230, 2007), the three-term PRP method proposed by Zhang et al. (IMA J. Numer. Anal. 26:629-640, 2006), and the descent PRP method proposed by Yu et al. (Optim. Methods Softw. 23:275-293, 2008). These modified methods possess the sufficient descent property without any line searches. Moreover, if the exact line search is used, they reduce to the classical PRP method. Under standard assumptions, we show that these three methods converge globally with a Wolfe line search. We also report some numerical results to show the efficiency of the proposed methods.

For the fundamental solution P(t, x) of the fractional heat operator partial derivative(t) + (-Delta)(beta/2) defined on the whole space R-N, due to the properties of P(t, x) established by H Yosida and some estimates of P(t, x) developed by L Caffarelli and A Figalli, we first use an iteration method to establish the estimates of lower bounds of positive mild solutions; then we obtain the unboundedness of solutions for large time. Finally we give a sufficient condition that the positive mild solution to a fractional reaction-diffusion system blows up in finite time.

Further results on the generalized Mittag-Leffler function operator	JOURNAL OF INEQUALITIES AND APPLICATIONS			English	Article						generalized Mittag-Leffler function; Laplace transform; Mellin transform; H-function; Mellin-Barnes type integrals; Riemann-Liouville fractional integral; Hilfer derivative		The present paper deals with the study of a generalized Mittag-Leffler function operator. This paper is based on the generalized Mittag-Leffler function introduced and studied by Saxena and Nishimoto (J. Fract. Calc. 37:43-52, 2010). Laplace and Mellin transforms of this new operator are investigated. The results are useful where the Mittag-Leffler function occurs naturally. The boundedness and composition properties of this operator are established. The importance of the derived results further lies in the fact that the results of the generalized Mittag-Leffler function defined by Prabhakar (Yokohama Math. J. 19:7-15, 1971), Shukla and Prajapati (J. Math. Anal. Appl. 336:797-811, 2007), and the multiindex Mittag-Leffler function due to Kiryakova (Fract. Calc. Appl. Anal. 2:445-462, 1999; J. Comput.

Further the results obtained are of general nature and include the results given earlier by Prajapati et al. (J. Inequal. Appl. 2013: 33, 2013) and Srivastava and Tomovski (Appl. Math.

Analytic and numerical solutions for systems of fractional Schrodinger equation	JOURNAL OF INEQUALITIES AND APPLICATIONS			English	Article							DIFFERENCE SCHEME; DIFFUSION	In this work, we address the existence and uniqueness of a fractional system involving nonlinear Schrodinger equations. This system of fractional partial differential equations arises in quantum mechanics. It describes how the quantum state of some physical system changes with time. We show that the system under consideration admits a global solution in appropriate functional spaces. The solution is shown to be unique. The technique is established as an analytic technique of the fixed point theorem. We suppose that all the functions are analytic in the open unit disk. The fractional differential operator is considered from the point of view of the Riemann-Liouville differential operator. Moreover, a numerical scheme for this solution is calculated.

First, a new class of generalized cone-invex set-valued maps, called cone-subinvex set-valued maps, is introduced. Then the sufficient optimality condition and two types dual theorems are established for weakly approximate minimizers under the assumption of cone-subinvexity. Finally, it also reveals the closed relationships between a weakly approximate minimizer of a cone-subinvex set-valued optimization problem and a weakly approximate solution of a kind of vector variational inequality.

Guan et al. (J. Inequal. Appl. 2014: 242, 2014) determined the largest value for S-2(T) among all trees of order n. They also conjectured that among all connected graphs of order n with m (n <= m <= 2n - 3) edges, G(m,n) is the unique graph which has maximal value of S2( G), where G(m,n) is a graph of order n with m edges which has m - n + 1 triangles with a common edge and 2n - m - 3 pendent edges incident with one end vertex of the common edge. In this paper, we confirm the conjecture with m = n.

In order to further discuss the mathematical properties of fuzzy rough variables, this paper extends some inequalities to the context of fuzzy rough theory based on the chance measure and the expected value operator, involving the Markov inequality, the Chebyshev inequality, the Holder inequality, the Minkowski inequality, and the Jensen inequality. After that, linearity, monotonicity, and continuity of critical values of fuzzy rough variables are also investigated.

Using the approximation numbers (alpha n(T))(n=0)(infinity) of operators from a Banach space X into a Banach space Y, we give the sufficient (not necessary) conditions on E such that the components U-E(app) (X, Y) := {T is an element of L(X, Y) : (alpha(n)(T))(n=0)(infinity) is an element of E} form an operator ideal, the finite rank operators are dense in the complete space of operators U-E(app) (X, Y) which is a longstanding open problem.

J	Chen, QQ; Zhu, YG				Chen, Qiqiong; Zhu, Yuanguo			A class of uncertain variational inequality problems	JOURNAL OF INEQUALITIES AND APPLICATIONS			English	Article						variational inequality; uncertainty theory; optimization; descent method; line search	SAMPLE AVERAGE APPROXIMATION	In this paper, we propose a new class of variational inequality problems, say, uncertain variational inequality problems based on uncertainty theory in finite Euclidean spaces . It can be viewed as another extension of classical variational inequality problems besides stochastic variational inequality problems. Note that both stochastic variational inequality problems and uncertain variational inequality problems involve uncertainty in the real world, thus they have no conceptual solutions. Hence, in order to solve uncertain variational inequality problems, we introduce the expected value of uncertain variables (vector). Then we convert it into a classical deterministic variational inequality problem, which can be solved by many algorithms that are developed on the basis of gap functions. Thus the core of this paper is to discuss under what conditions we can convert the expected value model of uncertain variational inequality problems into deterministic variational inequality problems. Finally, as an application, we present an example in a noncooperation game from economics.

The total claim amount is modeled by a non-standard renewal risk model with dependence between the claim size and the inter-arrival time introduced by a Farlie-Gumbel-Morgenstern copula. The price of the risky asset is described by an exponential Levy process. Based on some known results, the uniform asymptotic estimate for ruin probability with investment strategy is obtained with regularly varying tailed claims. Applying the asymptotic formula, we provide an approximation of the optimal investment strategy to maximize the expected terminal wealth subject to a risk constraint on the Value-at-Risk, which is defined with respect to finite-time discounted net loss. A numerical example is illustrated for the results, which demonstrates that big dependence parameter is advantageous for the insurer. We explain the reason by some inequalities.

In this paper, we present a descent-conjugate gradient algorithm for the split variational inclusion problems in Hilbert spaces. Next, a strong convergence theorem of the proposed algorithm is proved under suitable conditions. As an application, we give a new strong convergence theorem for the split feasibility problem in Hilbert spaces. Finally, we give numerical results for split variational inclusion problems to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed algorithm.

Families of sets not belonging to algebras and combinatorics of finite sets of ultrafilters	JOURNAL OF INEQUALITIES AND APPLICATIONS			English	Article						algebra of sets; sigma-algebra; ultrafilter; pairwise disjoint sets	THEOREMS	This article is a part of the theory developed by the author in which the following problem is solved under natural assumptions: to find necessary and sufficient conditions under which the union of atmost countable family of algebras on a certain set X is equal to P(X). Here the following new result is proved. Let {A(lambda)}(lambda is an element of Lambda) be a finite collection of algebras of sets given on a set X with #(Lambda) = n > 0, and for each lambda there exist at least 10/3n + root 2n/3 pairwise disjoint sets belonging to P(X) \ A(lambda). Then there exists a family {U-lambda(1), U-lambda(2)}(lambda is an element of Lambda) of pairwise disjoint subsets of X (U-lambda(i) boolean AND U-lambda'(j) = empty set except the case lambda = lambda', i = j); and for each lambda the following holds: if Q is an element of P(X) and Q contains one of the two sets U-lambda(1), U-lambda(2), and its intersection with the other set is empty, then Q is not an element of A(lambda).

The asymptotic distribution of the test is established under the null hypothesis that the mean mu remains as a constant. The consistency of the proposed test is also obtained under the alternative hypothesis that mu changes at some unknown time. Simulations demonstrate that the test behaves well for heavy-tailed sequences.

The projection methods in countably normed spaces	JOURNAL OF INEQUALITIES AND APPLICATIONS			English	Article							GENERALIZED PROJECTION	It is well known that a normed space is uniformly convex (smooth) if and only if its dual space is uniformly smooth (convex). We extend the notions of uniform convexity (smoothness) from normed spaces to countably normed spaces 'in which there is a countable number of compatible norms'. We get some fundamental links between Lindenstrauss duality formulas. A duality property between uniform convexity and uniform smoothness of countably normed spaces is also given. Moreover, based on the compatibility of those norms, it is interesting to show that 'from any point in a real uniformly convex complete countably normed space, the nearest point to a nonempty convex closed subset of the space is the same for all norms', which is helpful in further studies for fixed points.

Based on the validation data, the authors use the Kaplan-Meier estimate and kernel estimate to repair the censored response variable Y and explanatory X with measurement error. Based on the repaired data, the authors introduce an auxiliary vector suitable to define an estimated empirical log-likelihood function of the unknown parameter which has an asymptotic weighted sum of the chi(2)(1) variables. Using the result the authors can construct the asymptotic confidence regions of beta. But the method of estimating weights will reduce the precision of the confidence regions. Further, the authors adjust the preceding log-likelihood, and it is shown that the adjusted empirical log-likelihood has the asymptotic standard chi(2)(1) 1 distribution. The result can be used to construct the confidence regions of beta.

For a differentiable function, we introduce the definition of higher-order (C,alpha,gamma.rho,d)-convex function. A nontrivial example is also constructed which is in this class but not (F,alpha,gamma.rho,d))-convex. Based on the (C,alpha,gamma.rho,d))-convexity, sufficient optimality conditions for an efficient solution of the nondifferentiable multiobjective fractional programming problem are established. Further, a higher-order Mond-Weir type dual is formulated for this problem and appropriate duality results are proved under higher-order (C,alpha,gamma.rho,d))-assumptions.

The problems arise, for example, from the obstacle problems with a nonlinear source term or some contact problems. Based on the reformulated systems of the piecewise almost linear equations, we propose a class of semi-iterative algorithms to find the exact solution of the problems. We prove that the semi-iterative algorithms enjoy a nice monotone convergence property in the sense that subsets of the indices consisting of the indices, for which the corresponding components of the iterates violate the constraints, become smaller and smaller. Then the algorithms converge monotonically to the exact solutions of the problems in a finite number of steps. Some numerical experiments are presented to show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.

We establish the strong convergence of these two composite relaxed extragradient-like schemes to the same common solution of finitely many GMEPs and the SGEP, which is the unique solution of the HFPP for a strictly pseudocontractive mapping. In particular, we make use of weaker control conditions than previous ones for the sake of proving strong convergence. Utilizing these results, we first propose the composite implicit and explicit relaxed extragradient-like schemes for finding a common fixed point of a finite family of strictly pseudocontractive mappings, and then we derive their strong convergence to the unique common solution of the SGEP and some HFPP. Our results complement, develop, improve, and extend the corresponding ones given by some authors recently in this area.

Using some proper duality problems, we derive a posteriori L-2(0, T; L-2(Omega)) error estimates for the scalar functions.

We assume that , where is an alpha-inverse-strongly monotone mapping, is a maximal monotone operator, the domain of B is included in C. Let U denote the solution set of the constrained convex minimization problem. Based on the viscosity approximation method, we use a gradient-projection algorithm to propose composite iterative algorithms and find a common solution of the problems which we studied. Then we regularize it to find a unique solution by gradient-projection algorithm. The point which we find solves the variational inequality , . Under suitable conditions, the constrained convex minimization problem can be transformed into the split feasibility problem. Zeros of the sum of two operators can be transformed into the variational inequality problem and the fixed point problem. Furthermore, new strong convergence theorems and applications are obtained in Hilbert spaces, which are useful in nonlinear analysis and optimization.

It is proved that under appropriate conditions, the sequence generated by the hybrid shrinking projection method converges strongly to some point in EP boolean AND F. Relative examples are given. Strong convergence theorems are proved. The application for Bregman asymptotically quasi-nonexpansive mappings is also given. The main innovative points in this paper are as follows: (1) the notion of the uniformly closed family of countable Bregman quasi-Lipschitz mappings is presented and the useful conclusions are given; (2) the relative examples of the uniformly closed family of countable Bregman quasi-Lipschitz mappings are given in classical Banach spaces l(2) and L-2; (3) the application for Bregman asymptotically quasi-nonexpansive mappings is also given; (4) because the main theorems do not need the boundedness of the domain of mappings, so a corresponding technique for the proof is given. This new results improve and extend the previously known ones in the literature.

This paper deals with L-p risk estimation with 1 <= p < infinity based on wavelet bases. Motivated by the work of Youming and Junlian (2014), we construct new estimators: a linear one and a nonlinear adaptive one; an upper bound of wavelet estimators on L-p risk for a density function in Besov space is provided, which generalizes Abbaszadeh et al.'s theorems. It turns out that the nonlinear adaptive estimator obtains faster rate of convergence than the linear one for r < p.

The algebraic-analytical structure of the set of all finite atomic random variables on it with a given even number of moments is determined. It is used to derive an explicit version of the Chebyshev-Markov-Stieltjes inequalities suitable for computation. These inequalities are based on the theory of orthogonal polynomials, linear algebra, and the polynomial majorant/minorant method. The result is used to derive generalized Laguerre-Samuelson bounds for finite real sequences and generalized Chebyshev-Markov value-at-risk bounds. A financial market case study illustrates how the upper value-at-risk bounds work in the real world.			whurlimann@bluewin.ch						47	0	0	0	0	SPRINGEROPEN	LONDON	CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON, N1 9XW, ENGLAND	1029-242X			J INEQUAL APPL	J.

We prove that epsilon is a minimal member of S if and only if epsilon is a linear expectation. Let S be the set of all those convex expectations which are bigger than a concave expectation (resp. less than a convex expectation, sandwiched between a convex expectation and a concave expectation). We show that epsilon is a minimal member of S if and only if epsilon is a linear expectation with the same constraints as above, respectively.

More recently, the results of Lutwak have been generalized by Ma to the entire class of so-called ith p-affine surface areas. In this paper, we further research this new notion and give its integral representation. Affine isoperimetric and Blaschke-Santalo inequalities, which generalize the inequalities obtained by Lutwak, are established. Furthermore, we prove the ith p-affine area ratio of convex body K for the ith p-affine surface area, which does not exceed the generalized Santalo product of convex body K.

We state and prove a new refined Hardy-Knopp type inequality related to the weighted Lebesgue spaces. As a special case of our results, the refinements of multidimensional Hardy-Knopp type inequalities are obtained. Finally, we also apply a similar idea to prove some new norm inequalities in Orlicz spaces in which the properties of N-functions and superquadratic functions are involved.

The necessary and sufficient conditions under which the numerical stability regions contain the analytical stability regions are given. Moreover, the conditions of oscillation for the Euler-Maclaurin method are obtained. We show that the Euler-Maclaurin method preserves the oscillation of the exact solution.

We then prove that the proposed iterative methods converge strongly to the minimum-norm solution of the variational inequality. Finally, we apply our results to the constrained minimization problem and the split feasibility problem as well as the minimum-norm fixed point problem for pseudocontractive mappings.

Most of the conventional methods are constructed for solving inconsistent inverse problems with, e.g., dose-volume based objective functions, and one expects to obtain a feasible solution that minimally violates the DVCs. We introduce the concept of 'acceptable', meaning that there exists a nonempty set of radiation beam weights satisfying the given DVCs, and we resolve the issue that the objective and evaluation are different in the conventional planning approach. We apply the initial-value problem of the proposed dynamical system to an acceptable and inconsistent inverse problem and prove that the convergence to an equilibrium in the acceptable set of solutions is theoretically guaranteed by using the Lyapunov theorem. Indeed, we confirmed that we can obtain acceptable beam weights through numerical experiments using phantom data simulating a clinical setup for an acceptable and inconsistent IMRT planning system.

We here provide a recurrence relation for determining the coefficients a(j). The representation using recursive algorithm is better for numerical evaluations.

J	Lai, JF; Hou, J; Wen, ZC				Lai, Jun-Feng; Hou, Jian; Wen, Zong-Chuan			A smoothing method for a class of generalized Nash equilibrium problems	JOURNAL OF INEQUALITIES AND APPLICATIONS			English	Article						standard Nash equilibrium problem; generalized Nash equilibrium problem; normalized Nash equilibrium; Nikaido-Isoda function; M-stationary point	VARIATIONAL-INEQUALITIES; RELAXATION ALGORITHMS; ELECTRICITY MARKETS; GAMES	The generalized Nash equilibrium problem is an extension of the standard Nash equilibrium problem where both the utility function and the strategy space of each player depend on the strategies chosen by all other players. Recently, the generalized Nash equilibrium problem has emerged as an effective and powerful tool for modeling a wide class of problems arising in many fields and yet solution algorithms are extremely scarce. In this paper, using a regularized Nikaido-Isoda function, we reformulate the generalized Nash equilibrium problem as a mathematical program with complementarity constraints (MPCC). We then propose a suitable method for this MPCC and under some conditions, we establish the convergence of the proposed method by showing that any accumulation point of the generated sequence is a M-stationary point of the MPCC. Numerical results on some generalized Nash equilibrium problems are reported to illustrate the behavior of our approach.

The model of equity value is formulated as a parabolic variational inequality, or equivalently, a free boundary problem, where the free boundary corresponds to the optimal bankruptcy boundary. We present an analytical approach to analyze the behaviors of the free boundary. The regularity of the value function and the optimal dividend policy are studied as well.

We want to know the surface temperature in a body from a measured temperature history at a fixed location inside the body. This is an exponentially ill-posed problem in the sense that the solution (if it exists) does not depend continuously on the data. In this paper, we introduce the two new classes of quasi-type methods and iteration methods to solve the problem and prove that our methods are stable under both a priori and a posteriori parameter choice rules. An appropriate selection of a parameter in the scheme will get a satisfactory approximate solution. Furthermore, if we use the discrepancy principle we can avoid the selection of the a priori bound.

J	Wanjala, G				Wanjala, Gerald			Operator representation of sectorial linear relations and applications	JOURNAL OF INEQUALITIES AND APPLICATIONS			English	Article						linear form; sectorial linear relation; numerical range	EXTENSIONS	Let H be a Hilbert space with inner product <.,.> and let T be a non-densely defined linear relation in 7-t with domain D(T). We prove that if T is sectorial then it can be expressed in terms of some sectorial operator A with domain D(A) = D(T) and that T is maximal sectorial if and only if A is maximal sectorial in D(T). The operator A has the property that for every u is an element of D(A) and every v is an element of D(T) and any u' is an element of T(u), < Au,v > = < u',v >. We use this representation to show that every sectorial linear relation T is form closable, meaning that the form associated with T has a closed extension. We also prove a result similar to Kato's first representation theorem for sectorial linear relations. Unlike the results available in the literature, we do not assume that the graph of the linear relation T is a closed subspace of H x H.

Although their notion seems to be attractive, in this paper, we show how this concept can be reduced to the unidimensional notion of coincidence point, and how their main theorems can be seen as particular cases of existing results. Moreover, we prove that the proofs of their main statements have some gaps.

The Green function is constructed through so-called symmetric orthogonalization method under a suitable solvability condition. Its Green function is a reproducing kernel for a suitable set of Hilbert space and an inner product. By using the fact, we compute the best constant (M = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5) and a family of the best functions for a Sobolev inequality. It is possible for us to expect the best constant of the Sobolev inequality, but the proof has not been completed for M >= 6 in the present paper.

Under quite mild assumptions, we establish the strong convergence of the sequence generated by the proposed algorithm and provide an affirmative answer to an open problem posed by Mainge (Comput. Math. Appl. 59: 74-79, 2010) for quasi-nonexpansive mappings. In contrast with related processes, our method does not require any demiclosedness principle condition imposed on the involved operators belonging to the wide class of quasi-nonexpansive operators. As an application, we also introduce an iterative algorithm for finding a common element of the set of common fixed points of an infinite family of quasi-nonexpansive mappings and the set of solutions of a mixed equilibrium problem in a real Banach space. We prove a strong convergence theorem by using the proposed algorithm under some suitable conditions. Our results improve and generalize many known results in the current literature.

Mathematically, the underlying model is NP-hard in general. Thus an l(1) regularized projection minimization model is proposed for relaxation and an extragradient thresholding algorithm (ETA) is then designed for this regularized model. Furthermore, we analyze the convergence of this algorithm and show any cluster point of the sequence generated by ETA is a solution of NCP. Numerical results demonstrate that the ETA can effectively solve the l(1) regularized model and output very sparse solutions of co-coercive NCPs with high quality.

We employ some elementary results of semi-group theory to present the formula of solution, then show the instability cause. Since the solution exhibits unstable dependence on the given data functions, we propose a regularization method to stabilize the solution, then obtain the error estimate. A numerical example shows that the method is efficient and feasible. This work slightly extends the earlier results in Zouyed and Rebbani (J. Inverse Ill-Posed Probl. 22(4):449-466, 2014).

In this paper, two spectral gradient projection methods for constrained equations are proposed, which are combinations of the well-known spectral gradient method and the hyperplane projection method. The new methods are not only derivative-free, but also completely matrix-free, and consequently they can be applied to solve large-scale constrained equations. Under the condition that the underlying mapping of the constrained equations is Lipschitz continuous or strongly monotone, we establish the global convergence of the new methods. Compared with the existing gradient methods for solving such problems, the new methods possess a linear convergence rate under some error bound conditions. Furthermore, a relax factor. is attached in the update step to accelerate convergence. Preliminary numerical results show that they are efficient and promising in practice.

In the present paper, several types of quadratic fuzzy set-valued functional equations are introduced based on the space mentioned above. We prove the Hyers-Ulam stability of the standard quadratic fuzzy set-valued functional equation by using the fixed point technique. Simultaneously, we also establish some Ulam type stability results of the Deeba and Appolonius type fuzzy set-valued functional equations by employing the direct method, respectively. The stability results of the corresponding single-valued and set-valued functional equations acting as special cases will be included in our results.
