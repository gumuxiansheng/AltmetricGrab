Here s is an element of(0,1), Omega is an open bounded set of R-n, n > 2s, with continuous boundary, lambda is a positive real parameter, 2* = 2n / (n - 2s) is a fractional critical Sobolev exponent and f is a lower order perturbation of the critical power |u|(2)*(-2)u, while L-K is the integrodifferential operator defined as L(K)u(x) = integral(n)(R)(u(x + y) + u(x - y) - 2u(x)) K(y) dy, x is an element of R-n. Under suitable growth condition on f, we show that this problem admits non-trivial solutions for any positive parameter lambda. This existence theorem extends some results obtained in [15,19,20]. In the model case, that is when K(x) = |x|(-(n+2s)) (this gives rise to the fractional Laplace operator -(-Delta)(S)), the existence result proved along the paper may be read as the non-local fractional counterpart of the one obtained in [12] (see also [9]) in the framework of the classical Laplace equation with critical nonlinearities.

We explain how principal component analysis (PCA) can be used to transform curves into finite dimensional data. An application of PCA is developed to test for the equality of the means of several populations (functional analysis of variance). Asymptotics are derived under the null hypothesis that the populations have the same mean curves. The selection of the basis for the projections and the power of the test is discussed for simple random samples and stationary time series samples of curves. We review the part of the literature which is needed to establish the validity of the PCA method. Two data sets, magnetogram records and stock returns, are used to illustrate the applicability of our limit results.

In the present paper such predual spaces are shown to be characterized by means of the Littlewood-Paley operators. Recently, many function spaces are shown to admit the Littlewood-Paley characterization. As for the predual spaces of Morrey spaces, it had not been clear that a pointwise increasing norm-bounded sequence has a least bound. However, the author proved in the earlier paper that it actually has a least bound. In the present paper, by taking advantage of this property, a characterization by means of Littlewood-Paley operators is proposed.

We show that if assuming appropriate curvature bounds for the spaces, the multivalued extension operators that assign to every bounded nonexpansive (resp. bounded Lipschitz) mapping all its bounded nonexpansive extensions (resp. bounded Lipschitz extensions with the same Lipschitz constant) are lower semi-continuous and admit continuous selections. Moreover, we prove that Lipschitz mappings can be extended continuously even when imposing the condition that the image of the extension belongs to the closure of the convex hull of the image of the original mapping. When the target space is hyperconvex one can obtain in fact nonexpansivity.

It is well-known that the set of hyperelliptic surfaces (the hyperelliptic locus) is connected in but the set of (cyclic) trigonal surfaces is not. By contrast, the set of (cyclic) trigonal surfaces is connected in . We exhibit an explicit nodal surface that lies in the completion of every equisymmetric set of -gonal Riemann surfaces providing an alternative proof of a result of Achter and Pries (Math Ann 338:187-206, 2007). For the connectivity of the -gonal loci becomes more involved.

We consider the instationary Boussinesq equations in these approximating domains where the temperature satisfies certain Robin boundary conditions. In the limit we will observe an additional weight factor in the Robin boundary condition which reflects the rugosity of the boundaries. Motivated by this observation we deal with the converse situation. Indeed, we will show that every Robin boundary condition with a fixed weight factor can be generated in the asymptotic limit by a sequence of domains with rough boundaries.

Namely, we show that in both cases the exponent is attained on a parametrization of a component of (Theorems 6 and 7), thus being a rational number.

In particular, we show that there exist only finitely many jets of generalized series giving the pseudoexponent of (Theorem 5). The main tool in the proofs is the algebraic version of Newton's Polygon Method. The results are illustrated with some explicit examples.

The main example is the boundary of the graph of some classes vector-valued and non-smooth Sobolev maps, provided that the boundary current has finite mass. In fact, the action of such currents is non-zero only on forms with a high number (depending on the Sobolev regularity) of differentials in the direction of the vertical space. We prove that such vertical currents live on a set that projects on the horizontal space into a nice set with integer dimension. The dimension of the concentration set is related to the level of verticality that is assumed. Therefore, for boundary of graphs of Sobolev maps, this dimension decreases as the Sobolev exponent increases. As an application, we then prove a concentration property concerning the singular part of the distributional determinant and minors.

In that case, we also show that the Poincar, series associated to is a rational function whose denominator can be expressed in terms of the valuation vectors of the elements in the generating sequence. For this we do not need any assumptions on . However, a finite generating sequence does not always exist. We give an example of a modification whose semigroup of values is not finitely generated.

Linear images of linear groups	REVISTA MATEMATICA COMPLUTENSE			English	Article						Linear group; Linear image of a linear group		Let N be a (Zariski) closed normal subgroup of a linear group G of degree n. It is well known that G/N is always isomorphic to some linear group, but can the degree of this linear group be bounded in terms of n only. The brief answer we give to this is frequently yes, for example if G has characteristic zero or degree at most 2, but not always.
