One reason is the connection of one-dimensional examples such as a"not sign-free numbers with Sarnak's conjecture on the "randomness" of the Mobius function; another is the explicit computability of correlation functions as well as eigenfunctions for these systems together with intrinsic ergodicity properties. Here, we summarise some of the results, with focus on spectral and dynamical aspects, and expand a little on the implications for mathematical diffraction theory.

Neither convergence of the integral utility functional nor local boundedness of the optimal control is assumed. Using the classical needle variations technique we develop a normal form version of the Pontryagin maximum principle with an explicitly specified adjoint variable under weak regularity assumptions. The result generalizes some previous results in this direction. An illustrative economical example is presented.	[Aseev, S.

In Sections 3-10 we survey several significant results obtained by the author and his successors using the Novikov-Adian theory and its various modifications. In the second part (Sections 11-15) we outline a new modification of the Novikov-Adian theory. The new modification allows us to decrease to n a parts per thousand yen 101 the lower bound on the odd periods n for which one can prove the infiniteness of the free periodic groups B(m, n).

In the previous paper (Physica D 255, 31-34 (2013)), we obtained an equation (called below the conjugacy equation) for such tables and proved that if alpha, the rotation angle, is rationally incommensurable with pi, then the conjugacy equation has a solution in the category of formal series. In the same paper there is also numerical evidence that for "good" rotation angles the series have positive radii of convergence. In the present paper we carry out a further study (both analytic and numerical) of the conjugacy equation. We discuss its symmetries, dependence of the convergence radius on alpha, and other aspects.

Adiabatic limit in the Ginzburg-Landau and Seiberg-Witten equations	PROCEEDINGS OF THE STEKLOV INSTITUTE OF MATHEMATICS			English	Article							PSEUDO-HOLOMORPHIC-CURVES; ABELIAN-HIGGS-MODEL; VORTICES; INVARIANTS; SCATTERING; MONOPOLES; SW; GR; 4-MANIFOLDS; MANIFOLDS	Hyperbolic Ginzburg-Landau equations arise in gauge field theory as the Euler-Lagrange equations for the (2 + 1)-dimensional Abelian Higgs model. The moduli space of their static solutions, called vortices, was described by Taubes; however, little is known about the moduli space of dynamic solutions. Manton proposed to study dynamic solutions with small kinetic energy with the help of the adiabatic limit by introducing the "slow time" on solution trajectories. In this limit the dynamic solutions converge to geodesics in the space of vortices with respect to the metric generated by the kinetic energy functional. So, the original equations reduce to Euler geodesic equations, and by solving them one can describe the behavior of slowly moving dynamic solutions. It turns out that this procedure has a 4-dimensional analog. Namely, for the Seiberg-Witten equations on 4-dimensional symplectic manifolds it is possible to introduce an analog of the adiabatic limit. In this limit, solutions of the Seiberg-Witten equations reduce to families of vortices in normal planes to pseudoholomorphic curves, which can be considered as complex analogs of geodesics parameterized by "complex time." The study of the adiabatic limit for the equations indicated in the title is the main content of this paper.

An Open-loop criterion for the solvability of a closed-loop guidance problem with incomplete information: Linear control systems	PROCEEDINGS OF THE STEKLOV INSTITUTE OF MATHEMATICS			English	Article						control; incomplete information; linear systems		The method of open-loop control packages is a tool for stating the solvability of guaranteed closed-loop control problems under incomplete information on the observed states. In this paper, a solution method is specified for the problem of guaranteed closed-loop guidance of a linear control system to a convex target set at a prescribed point in time. It is assumed that the observed signal on the system's states is linear and the set of its admissible initial states is finite. It is proved that the problem under consideration is equivalent to the problem of open-loop guidance of an extended linear control system to an extended convex target set.

Applications to the theory of coincidence points	PROCEEDINGS OF THE STEKLOV INSTITUTE OF MATHEMATICS			English	Article							FIXED-POINTS; MAPPINGS	We consider a lower bounded function on a complete metric space. For this function, we obtain conditions, including Caristi's conditions, under which this function attains its infimum. These results are applied to the study of the existence of a coincidence point of two mappings acting from one metric space to another. We consider both single-valued and set-valued mappings one of which is a covering mapping and the other is Lipschitz continuous. Special attention is paid to the study of a degenerate case that includes, in particular, generalized contraction mappings.	[Arutyunov, A.

Laurent phenomenon for Landau-Ginzburg models of complete intersections in Grassmannians	PROCEEDINGS OF THE STEKLOV INSTITUTE OF MATHEMATICS			English	Article							TORIC DEGENERATIONS; MIRROR SYMMETRY; FANO THREEFOLDS	In 1997 Batyrev, Ciocan-Fontanine, Kim, and van Straten suggested a construction of Landau-Ginzburg models for Fano complete intersections in Grassmannians similar to Givental's construction for complete intersections in smooth toric varieties. We show that for a Fano complete intersection in a Grassmannian the result of the above construction is birational to a complex torus. In other words, the complete intersections under consideration have very weak Landau-Ginzburg models.

Envelope solitary waves and dark solitons at a water-ice interface	PROCEEDINGS OF THE STEKLOV INSTITUTE OF MATHEMATICS			English	Article							SURFACE-TENSION; VECTOR-FIELDS	The article is devoted to the study of some self-focusing and defocusing features of monochromatic waves in basins with horizontal bottom under an ice cover. The form and propagation of waves in such basins are described by the full 2D Euler equations. The ice cover is modeled by an elastic Kirchhoff-Love plate and is assumed to be of considerable thickness so that the inertia of the plate is taken into account in the formulation of the model. The Euler equations involve the additional pressure from the plate that is freely floating at the surface of the fluid. Obviously, the self-focusing is closely connected with the existence of so-called envelope solitary waves, for which the envelope speed (group speed) is equal to the speed of filling (phase speed). In the case of defocusing, solitary envelope waves are replaced by socalled dark solitons. The indicated families of solitary waves are parametrized by the wave propagation speed and bifurcate from the quiescent state. The dependence of the existence of envelope solitary waves and dark solitons on the basin's depth is investigated.

It is shown that the manifold M (n), where n > 1, is algebraic and its dimension is not greater than n + 1. We give a family of polynomials generating the relation ideal in the polynomial ring on M (n). In the case n = 2 the generators of this ideal are described. As a corollary we obtain an effective description of the manifold M (2) and therefore all series determining complex Hirzebruch genera that are fiberwise multiplicative on projectivizations of complex vector bundles. A family of analytic solutions of the second Hirzebruch equation is described in terms of Weierstrass elliptic functions and in terms of Baker-Akhiezer functions of elliptic curves. For this functions the curves differ, yet the series expansions in the vicinity of 0 coincide.	[Buchstaber, V. M.; Bunkova, E.

To this end, we introduce a class of LA ' evy Laplacians parameterized by the choice of a curve in the group SO(4). Two approaches are used to define such Laplacians: (i) the L,vy Laplacian can be defined as an integral functional defined by a curve in SO(4) and a special form of the second-order derivative, or (ii) the L,vy Laplacian can be defined as the CesA ro mean of second-order derivatives along vectors from the orthonormal basis constructed by such a curve. We prove that under some conditions imposed on the curve generating the L,vy Laplacian, a connection in the trivial vector bundle with base R-4 is an instanton (or an anti-instanton) if and only if the parallel transport generated by the connection is harmonic for such a L,vy Laplacian.

The peculiarity of the direct problem consists in the inhomogeneity and irregularity of mixed boundary data. Solvability and stability conditions are specified for the direct problem. The inverse boundary value problem consists in finding some traces of the solution of the corresponding boundary value problem for given standard and additional data on a certain part of the boundary of the domain of the independent variable.

Optimal Control with Connected Initial and Terminal Conditions	PROCEEDINGS OF THE STEKLOV INSTITUTE OF MATHEMATICS			English	Article						terminal control; boundary value problems; convex programming; Lagrangian; solution methods; convergence	EXTRAGRADIENT METHOD	An optimal control problem with linear dynamics is considered on a fixed time interval. The ends of the interval correspond to terminal spaces, and a finite-dimensional optimization problem is formulated on the Cartesian product of these spaces. Two components of the solution of this problem define the initial and terminal conditions for the controlled dynamics. The dynamics in the optimal control problem is treated as an equality constraint. The controls are assumed to be bounded in the norm of L-2. A saddle-point method is proposed to solve the problem. The method is based on finding saddle points of the Lagrangian. The weak convergence of the method in controls and its strong convergence in state trajectories, dual trajectories, and terminal variables are proved.	[Antipin, A.

On the question of construction of an attraction set under constraints of asymptotic nature	PROCEEDINGS OF THE STEKLOV INSTITUTE OF MATHEMATICS			English	Article						filter base; finitely additive measure; attraction set; generalized element; ultrafilter	EXTENSIONS; SYSTEM	We study a variant of the reachability problem with constraints of asymptotic character on the choice of controls. More exactly, we consider a control problem in the class of impulses of given intensity and vanishingly small length. The situation is complicated by the presence of discontinuous dependences, which produce effects of the type of multiplying a discontinuous function by a generalized function. The constructed extensions in the special class of finitely additive measures make it possible to present the required solution, defined as an asymptotic analog of a reachable set, in terms of a continuous image of a compact, which is described with the use of the Stone space corresponding to the natural algebra of sets of the control interval. One of the authors had the honor of communicating with Nikolai Nikolaevich Krasovskii for many years and discussed with him problems that led to the statement considered in the paper. Krasovskii's support of this research direction provided possibilities for its fruitful development.

We show that the problem is strongly NP-hard in the general case and preserves intractability even in the geometric statement.

On elementary theories of ordinal notation systems based on reflection principles	PROCEEDINGS OF THE STEKLOV INSTITUTE OF MATHEMATICS			English	Article							PROVABILITY ALGEBRAS	L.D. Beklemishev has recently introduced a constructive ordinal notation system for the ordinal E > (0). We consider this system and its fragments for smaller ordinals omega (n) (towers of omega-exponentiations of height n). These systems are based on Japaridze's well-known polymodal provability logic. They are used in the technique of ordinal analysis of the Peano arithmetic PA and its fragments on the basis of iterated reflection schemes. Ordinal notation systems can be regarded as models of the first-order language. We prove that the full notation system and its fragments for ordinals a parts per thousand yen omega (4) have undecidable elementary theories.

On the Stability of a Procedure for Solving a Minimax Control Problem for a Positional Functional	PROCEEDINGS OF THE STEKLOV INSTITUTE OF MATHEMATICS			English	Article						optimal control; differential games; stability	COMPACT CONVEX-SETS; PROPERTY	We consider a minimax feedback control problem for a linear dynamic system with a positional quality criterion, which is the norm of the family of deviations of the motion from given target points at given times. The problem is formalized as a positional differential game. A procedure for calculating the value of the game based on the backward construction of upper convex hulls of auxiliary program functions is studied. We also study a method of generating a minimax control law based on this procedure and on the extremal shift principle. The stability of the proposed resolving constructions with respect to computational and informational noises is proved.	[Gomoyunov, M. I.; Lukoyanov, N.

Embedded flexible spherical cross-polytopes with nonconstant volumes	PROCEEDINGS OF THE STEKLOV INSTITUTE OF MATHEMATICS			English	Article							POLYHEDRA; DIMENSIONS; OCTAHEDRA; CURVATURE	We construct examples of embedded flexible cross-polytopes in the spheres of all dimensions. These examples are interesting from two points of view. First, in dimensions 4 and higher, they are the first examples of embedded flexible polyhedra. Notice that, in contrast to the spheres, in the Euclidean and Lobachevsky spaces of dimensions 4 and higher still no example of an embedded flexible polyhedron is known. Second, we show that the volumes of the constructed flexible cross-polytopes are nonconstant during the flexion. Hence these cross-polytopes give counterexamples to the Bellows Conjecture for spherical polyhedra. Earlier a counterexample to this conjecture was constructed only in dimension 3 (V.A. Alexandrov, 1997), and it was not embedded. For flexible polyhedra in spheres we suggest a weakening of the Bellows Conjecture, which we call the Modified Bellows Conjecture. We show that this conjecture holds for all flexible cross-polytopes of the simplest type, which includes our counterexamples to the ordinary Bellows Conjecture. Simultaneously, we obtain several geometric results on flexible cross-polytopes of the simplest type. In particular, we write down relations for the volumes of their faces of codimensions 1 and 2.

Optimization of the Hausdorff distance between sets in Euclidean space	PROCEEDINGS OF THE STEKLOV INSTITUTE OF MATHEMATICS			English	Article						Hausdorff distance; polygon; best n-net; disk cover	SYSTEMS; CIRCLES	Set approximation problems play an important role in many areas of mathematics and mechanics. For example, approximation problems for solvability sets and reachable sets of control systems are intensively studied in differential game theory and optimal control theory. In N.N. Krasovskii and A.I. Subbotin's investigations devoted to positional differential games, one of the key problems was the problem of identification of solvability sets, which are maximal stable bridges. Since this problem can be solved exactly in rare cases only, the question of the approximate calculation of solvability sets arises. In papers by A.B. Kurzhanskii and F.L. Chernous'ko and their colleagues, reachable sets were approximated by ellipsoids and parallelepipeds. In the present paper, we consider problems in which it is required to approximate a given set by arbitrary polytopes. Two sets, polytopes A and B, are given in Euclidean space. It is required to find a position of the polytopes that provides a minimum Hausdorff distance between them. Though the statement of the problem is geometric, methods of convex and nonsmooth analysis are used for its investigation. One of the approaches to dealing with planar sets in control theory is their approximation by families of disks of equal radii. A basic component of constructing such families is best n-nets and their generalizations, which were described, in particular, by A.L. Garkavi. The authors designed an algorithm for constructing best nets based on decomposing a given set into subsets and calculating their Chebyshev centers. Qualitative estimates for the deviation of sets from their best n-nets as n grows to infinity were given in the general case by A.N. Kolmogorov. We derive a numerical estimate for the Hausdorff deviation of one class of sets. Examples of constructing best n-nets are given.	[Ushakov, V. N.; Lebedev, P.

J	Chentsov, AG; Baklanov, AP				Chentsov, A. G.; Baklanov, A. P.			On an asymptotic analysis problem related to the construction of an attainability domain	PROCEEDINGS OF THE STEKLOV INSTITUTE OF MATHEMATICS			English	Article							DIFFERENTIAL GAME; ATTRACTION SET; ULTRAFILTERS; QUESTION; REPRESENTATION; CONSTRAINTS; EXTENSIONS	Problems of constructing and analyzing the properties of attainability domains play an important role in control theory and its applications. In particular, this applies to control under impulse constraints that reflect the energetics of a process. The situation is complicated by the possible instability of the process under variation (in particular, under relaxation) of constraints related to boundary and intermediate conditions. Stability of the problem is also missing, in general, under relaxation of state constraints. In these cases, it is natural to focus on the asymptotic variant of the statement; this is especially expedient when one has to deal with initially asymptotic requirements. In all these cases, it seems expedient to use analogs of J. Warga's approximate solutions. At the same time, to seek necessary approximate (and, in fact, asymptotic) solutions, it is natural to use generalized modes. For problems with impulse constraints and discontinuity in the coefficients of control actions, such modes lead to phenomena described by products of discontinuous functions and generalized functions even in the class of linear systems. In a large series of his studies, to overcome the arising difficulties, one of the authors used constructions of extension in the class of finitely additive measures. The present paper follows this approach and is ideologically relevant to the engineering problem of controlling the thrust of an engine under conditions of a given program of variation of its orientation; it is postulated that energy resources are completely consumed in a natural (for a number of impulse control problems) mode of short-duration impulses: the set of time instants at which the instantaneous control is different from zero can be embedded in an interval of vanishingly small length. Within these short periods of time, the engine should consume all energy resources while obeying some other constraints (making the sense of moment constraints) to a high degree of accuracy. In addition, one should take into account the possible discontinuity of the functions defining the coefficients of control actions. As a natural analog of the attainability domain, we use an attraction set, whose construction, together with the subsequent study of its main properties, constitutes the goal of the present study.

Calculation of the derivative of an inaccurately defined function by means of feedback laws	PROCEEDINGS OF THE STEKLOV INSTITUTE OF MATHEMATICS			English	Article							CONTROLLED MODELS; DELAY SYSTEM; RECONSTRUCTION; OPERATOR; INPUT	The problem of calculating the derivative of an inaccurately defined function is considered. This problem is one of the "classical" problems in mathematical analysis. Various algorithms for solving this problem have been proposed by many authors. In the present study, constructions of positional control theory are invoked to solve this problem. Due to the presence of error in the measurement of the values of a function, the exact calculation of the derivative seems to be impossible. In view of this feature, a problem solving algorithm is presented that is based on an appropriate modification of the method of models controlled by feedback laws and is robust with respect to informational noise and measurement errors.

The properties of the medium are defined so that for slow processes with characteristic times much greater than the stress relaxation time, the medium behaves as an elastoplastic medium. We analyze continuous travelling waves in the form of smoothed steps regarded as discontinuity structures in an elastoplastic medium and demonstrate the dependence of relations at discontinuities on the definition of the stress relaxation process in the discontinuity structure.

We first look at this analogy and survey the known results, putting emphasis on the study of tight relative t-designs in certain Q-polynomial association schemes. We then specifically study tight relative 2-designs on two shells in binary Hamming association schemes H(n, 2) and Johnson association schemes J(v, k). The purpose of this paper is to convince the reader that there is a rich theory even for these special cases and that the time is ripe to study tight relative t-designs more systematically for general Q-polynomial association schemes.

Extremal problems of circle packings on a sphere and irreducible contact graphs	PROCEEDINGS OF THE STEKLOV INSTITUTE OF MATHEMATICS			English	Article							DIMENSIONS; POINTS; PROOF	Recently, we have enumerated (up to isometry) all locally rigid packings of congruent circles (spherical caps) on the unit sphere with the number of circles N < 12. This problem is equivalent to the enumeration of irreducible spherical contact graphs. In this paper, we show that using the list of irreducible contact graphs, one can solve various problems on extremal packings such as the Tammes problem for the sphere and projective plane, the problem of the maximum kissing number in spherical packings, Danzer's problems, and other problems on irreducible contact graphs.

The problem is formalized as a positional differential game. A numerical method is given for finding an approximation of the game value and constructing an optimal (minimax and maximin) control law. The method is based on the recursive construction of upper convex (concave) hulls of auxiliary program functions. In addition, we use the "pixel" approximation of the domains of convexified functions and the approximate construction of the upper convex hull of a function as the lower envelope of a finite set of support hyperplanes of its subgraph.

On the unimprovability of full-memory strategies in problems of guaranteed result optimization	PROCEEDINGS OF THE STEKLOV INSTITUTE OF MATHEMATICS			English	Article						optimal guaranteed result; full-memory control strategies; functionally constrained disturbances; quasi-strategies	GAME	A problem of guaranteed result optimization is considered for a control system described by an ordinary differential equation and for a performance functional that depends continuously on the trajectory of the system. The values of the control and of the disturbance satisfy compact geometric constraints. It is also assumed that the realization of the disturbance is subject to an unknown functional constraint from a given set of constraints that are compact in a Lebesgue space. It is shown that the optimal guaranteed result in the class of full-memory strategies in this problem coincides with the value of the optimal guaranteed result in the class of quasi-strategies.

The Bernstein-Szego Inequality for Fractional Derivatives of Trigonometric Polynomials	PROCEEDINGS OF THE STEKLOV INSTITUTE OF MATHEMATICS			English	Article						trigonometric polynomial; Weyl fractional derivative; Bernstein inequality; Szego inequality	INTEGRAL-INEQUALITIES	On the set A, of trigonometric polynomials of degree n >= 1 with complex coefficients, we consider the Szego operator D-theta(alpha) defined by the relation D-theta(alpha) f(n) (t) = cos theta D-alpha f(n) (t) sin theta D-alpha f(n) (t) for alpha, theta is an element of R N, where alpha >= 0. Here, D-alpha f(n) P f and D(alpha)f(n) are the Weyl fractional derivatives of (real) order a of the polynomial f of its conjugate /Th. In particular, we that, if a > n In 2n, then, for any 0 E N, the sharp inequality Mcos 0 D' f sin 0 D prove p f L, holds on the set 3;-Th in the spaces Lp for all p >= 0. For classical derivatives (of integer order a > 1), this inequality was obtained by Szego in the uniform norm (p = infinity) in 1928 and by Zygmund for 1 <= p <= infinity in 1931-1935. For fractional derivatives of (real) order alpha >= 1 and 1 <= p <= infinity, the inequality was proved by Kozko in 1998.	[Arestov, V. V.; Glazyrina, P.

These descriptions have gradually evolved from tiling vertex models to random cluster models, as the structures of real and simulated quasicrystals have been clarified experimentally. In this paper I outline these developments and explain why this productive dialogue between mathematicians and materials scientists will continue.

Using the Turaev-Viro invariants, we establish that every compact 3-manifold M with connected nonempty boundary has a finite number of poor special spines. Moreover, all poor special spines of the manifold M have the same number of true vertices. We prove that the complexity of a compact hyperbolic 3-manifold with totally geodesic boundary that has a poor special spine with two 2-components and n true vertices is equal to n. Such manifolds are constructed for infinitely many values of n.	[Vesnin, A. Yu; Turaev, V. G.; Fominykh, E. A.] Chelyabinsk State Univ, Chelyabinsk 454001, Russia; [Vesnin, A.

Solutions of a dynamic system are presented in a general form, encompassing, in particular, processes with various-type fractional derivatives, impulse processes, and systems of integral, integro-differential and difference-differential equations. Ideas of the method of resolving functions are used as a basis for investigation. While scalar resolving functions execute attraction of sets to the origin, the matrix functions introduced in the paper also admit rotation through any angle, which essentially extends the scope of applications of the method. Sufficient conditions for the termination of the game in a guaranteed time in the class of quasistrategies and stroboscopic strategies are developed.	[Chikrii, A. A.; Chikrii, G.

An optimal control problem of minimizing an integral regularized functional of dynamics and statistics residuals is introduced. Optimal synthesis is used to construct controls and trajectories that approximate a solution of the inverse problem. A numerical approximation method based on the method of characteristics for the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation and on the notion of minimax/viscosity solution is developed. Sufficient conditions are obtained under which the proposed approximations converge to a normal solution of the inverse problem under a matched vanishing of the approximation parameters (bounds for the sampling error, the regularizing parameter, the grid step in the state variable, and the integration step). Results of the numerical solution of identification and recovery problems for controls and trajectories are presented for a mechanical model of gravitation under given statistics of phase coordinate sampling.

For a given standard control system, we consider a set of time translations and construct the closure of this set in the topology of uniform convergence on compact sets.

As corollaries to this theorem, we obtain an inverse function theorem, an error bound theorem, and a tangent cone theorem that extend and strengthen the corresponding classical results in the irregular case. Using these corollaries, we establish necessary extremum conditions that are meaningful for abnormal problems.	[Avakov, E.

Problem of optimal endogenous growth with exhaustible resources and possibility of a technological jump	PROCEEDINGS OF THE STEKLOV INSTITUTE OF MATHEMATICS			English	Article								In 2013, S. Aseev, K. Besov, and S. Kaniovski ("The problem of optimal endogenous growth with exhaustible resources revisited," Dyn. Model. Econometr. Econ. Finance 14, 3-30) considered the problem of optimal dynamic allocation of economic resources in an endogenous growth model in which both production and research sectors require an exhaustible resource as an input. The problem is formulated as an infinite-horizon optimal control problem with an integral constraint imposed on the control. A full mathematical study of the problem was carried out, and it was shown that the optimal growth is not sustainable under the most natural assumptions about the parameters of the model. In the present paper we extend the model by introducing an additional possibility of "random" transition (jump) to a qualitatively new technological trajectory (to an essentially unlimited backstop resource). As an objective functional to be maximized, we consider the expected value of the sum of the objective functional in the original problem on the time interval before the jump and an evaluation of the state of the model at the moment of the jump. The resulting problem also reduces to an infinite-horizon optimal control problem, and we prove an existence theorem for it and write down an appropriate version of the Pontryagin maximum principle. Then we characterize the optimal transitional dynamics and compare the results with those for the original problem (without a jump).	[Besov, K.

We construct an approximating differential game in the class of pure positional strategies in which the motion of a conflict-controlled system is described by ordinary differential equations and the quality index is terminal. We show that the value of the approximating game gives the value of the original game in the limit, and that the optimal strategies in the original game can be constructed by using the optimal motions of the approximating game as guides.

The exposition is self-contained: all necessary preliminary facts are proved. These facts are mainly related to the properties of solutions to differential equations with discontinuous right-hand side and are derived as corollaries to the implicit function theorem, which, in turn, is a direct consequence of Newton's method for solving nonlinear equations.

This reason is clarified by the Zelikin-Lokutsievskiy-Hildebrand theorem about the fractal structure of solutions to generic piecewise smooth Hamiltonian systems. The instability of the two-dimensional model of the ring with continuous surface density of the distribution of particles is proved both for the Newton and Boltzmann equations.

In this paper, we obtain a description of finite pi-indecomposable groups all of whose 2-maximal subgroups are pi-decomposable. The proof involves the author's recent results connected with the notion of control of the prime spectrum of a finite simple group.

We show that the problem is strongly NP-hard both in the general case and in two subclasses, which have important applications. An approximation algorithm for this problem is presented. We show that the algorithm finds a solution with a bounded approximation ratio for the considered subclasses of the problem, and the bound is attainable. In the case when the number of cliques to be found is fixed in advance (i.e., is a parameter), the time complexity of the algorithm is polynomial.	[Gimadi, E. Kh.; Kel'manov, A. V.; Pyatkin, A.

A problem statement typical for the residual method is reduced to a minimization problem for an appropriate penalty function. We apply two classical penalty functions: the quadratic penalty function and the exact EreminZangwill penalty function. For each of the approaches, we establish convergence conditions and bounds for the approximation error.	[Skarin, V.

Some remarks on symmetrical extensions of graphs	PROCEEDINGS OF THE STEKLOV INSTITUTE OF MATHEMATICS			English	Article						graph; automorphism group; symmetrical extension of graphs		It is proved that results from a previous paper of the author on symmetrical 2-extensions of graphs can be extended to symmetrical p-extensions of graphs for any prime p. In particular, it is proved that, for any prime p, there are only finitely many symmetrical p-extensions of a locally finite graph with an abelian subgroup of finite index in its automorphism group. Some refinements of these results are also obtained. In addition, we consider the question on the possibility to represent symmetrical extensions of a d-dimensional grid (and similar graphs) in the d-dimensional affine Euclidean space in such a way that a corresponding vertex-transitive group of automorphisms of the extension is induced by some crystallographic group of motions of the space.

The solution of this equation contains singularities of various types; namely, along with a smooth background, the solution has sharp bends and jump discontinuities. For the construction of a stable approximated solution, a modified Tikhonov method with a stabilizer in the form of the sum of three functionals is proposed. Each of the functionals accounts for the specific character of the corresponding component of the solution.

Local approach and the theory of lovozerite structures	PROCEEDINGS OF THE STEKLOV INSTITUTE OF MATHEMATICS			English	Article							CRYSTAL-STRUCTURE; CELLULAR-AUTOMATA; COMPLEXITY; CHEMISTRY	The local theorem and local approach to regular point systems and tilings are considered as applied to lovozerite structures, which form isohedral tilings of the space E (n) into cubes with two v-octants situated along a solid diagonal of a cube. All lovozerite tilings that satisfy the following three basic conditions are derived: (1) the tilings are isohedral; (2) the cubes can be joined to share either entire faces or rectangular half-faces; (3) the v-octants of neighboring cubes share vertices but never share edges or faces. Local conditions of the regularity of tilings in terms of the first coronas and subcoronas are considered. With the use of the information entropy of structures corresponding to lovozerite tilings, it is shown that in nature one encounters, as a rule, the simplest structures (four of the ten possible tilings are realized in the crystal structures of minerals and inorganic compounds).

J	Panina, GY				Panina, Gaiane Yu			Cyclopermutohedron	PROCEEDINGS OF THE STEKLOV INSTITUTE OF MATHEMATICS			English	Article								It is well known that the k-faces of the permutohedron I (n) can be labeled by (all possible) linearly ordered partitions of the set [n] = {1,..., n} into n - k nonempty parts. The incidence relation corresponds to the refinement: a face F contains a face F' whenever the label of F' refines the label of F. We consider the cell complex CP (n+1) defined in a similar way but with the linear ordering replaced by the cyclic ordering. Namely, the k-cells of the complex CP (n+1) are labeled by (all possible) cyclically ordered partitions of the set [n + 1] = {1,..., n + 1} into n + 1 - k > 2 nonempty parts. The incidence relation in CP (n+1) again corresponds to the refinement: a cell F contains a cell F' whenever the label of F' refines the label of F. The complex CP (n+1) cannot be represented by a convex polytope, since it is not a combinatorial sphere (not even a combinatorial manifold). However, it can be represented by some virtual polytope (that is, the Minkowski difference of two convex polytopes), which we call a cyclopermutohedron CP (n+1). It is defined explicitly as a weighted Minkowski sum of line segments. Informally, the cyclopermutohedron can be viewed as a "permutohedron with diagonals." One of the motivations for introducing such an object is that the cyclopermutohedron is a "universal" polytope for moduli spaces of polygonal linkages.

A.; Wang, Wei			Proportional economic growth under conditions of limited natural resources	PROCEEDINGS OF THE STEKLOV INSTITUTE OF MATHEMATICS			English	Article							NONLINEAR STABILIZER; TRAJECTORIES	The paper is devoted to economic growth models in which the dynamics of production factors satisfy proportionality conditions. One of the main production factors in the problem of optimizing the productivity of natural resources is the current level of resource consumption, which is characterized by a sharp increase in the prices of resources compared with the price of capital. Investments in production factors play the role of control parameters in the model and are used to maintain proportional economic development. To solve the problem, we propose a two-level optimization structure. At the lower level, proportions are adapted to the changing economic environment according to the optimization mechanism of the production level under fixed cost constraints. At the upper level, the problem of optimal control of investments for an aggregate economic growth model is solved by means of the Pontryagin maximum principle. The application of optimal proportional constructions leads to a system of nonlinear differential equations, whose steady states can be considered as equilibrium states of the economy. We prove that the steady state is not stable, and the system tends to collapse (the production level declines to zero) if the initial point does not coincide with the steady state. We study qualitative properties of the trajectories generated by the proportional development dynamics and indicate the regions of production growth and decay. The parameters of the model are identified by econometric methods on the basis of China's economic data.	[Kryazhimskiy, A.

On an optimal flow in a class of nilpotent convex problems	PROCEEDINGS OF THE STEKLOV INSTITUTE OF MATHEMATICS			English	Article							MULTIDIMENSIONAL CONTROL; TRAJECTORIES; SYSTEMS	A comprehensive analysis of optimal synthesis is carried out for a class of nilpotent convex problems with multidimensional control. It is shown that the synthesis of optimal trajectories forms a nonsmooth half-flow (which is reasonably called optimal) in the state space. An optimal solution starting at some point of the state space is the trajectory of this point under the action of the optimal flow. The existence of an optimal flow entails many important corollaries. For example, applying the Cantor-Bendixson theorem, one can prove that an optimal control in nilpotent convex problems may have at most a countable number of discontinuity points.	[Lokutsievskiy, L.

Transverse fundamental group and projected embeddings	PROCEEDINGS OF THE STEKLOV INSTITUTE OF MATHEMATICS			English	Article							EUCLIDEAN-SPACE; BRAID-GROUPS; MAPS	For a generic degree d smooth map f: N (n) -> M (n) we introduce its "transverse fundamental group" pi(f), which reduces to pi(1)(M) in the case where f is a covering, and in general admits a monodromy homomorphism pi(f) -> S (|d|); nevertheless, we show that pi(f) can be nontrivial even for rather simple degree 1 maps S (n) -> S (n) . We apply pi(f) to the problem of lifting f to an embedding N a dagger(a) M x a"e(2): for such a lift to exist, the monodromy pi(f) -> S (|d|) must factor through the group of concordance classes of |d|-component string links. At least if |d| < 7, this requires pi(f) to be torsion-free.

Steklov's Problem of Estimating the Growth of Orthogonal Polynomials	PROCEEDINGS OF THE STEKLOV INSTITUTE OF MATHEMATICS			English	Article								The well-known problem of V.A. Steklov is closely related to the following extremal problem. For a fixed n a a"center dot, find , where I center dot (n) (z) is an orthonormal polynomial with respect to a measure sigma a S (delta) and S (delta) is the Steklov class of probability measures sigma on the unit circle such that sigma'(theta) a parts per thousand yen delta/(2 pi) > 0 at every Lebesgue point of sigma. There is an elementary estimate M (n) a parts per thousand(2) aen. E.A. Rakhmanov proved in 1981 that M (n) a parts per thousand(3) aen/(ln n)(3/2). Our main result is that M (n) a parts per thousand(3) aen, i.e., that the elementary estimate is sharp. The paper gives a survey of the results on the solution of this extremal problem and on the general problem of Steklov in the theory of orthogonal polynomials. The paper also analyzes the asymptotics of some trigonometric polynomials defined by Fej,r convolutions. These polynomials can be used to construct asymptotic solutions to the extremal problem under consideration.	[Aptekarev, A. I.; Tulyakov, D.

The article is being released for the 150th anniversary of the scientist. The authors employ his Recollections, published in 1991 by the Leningrad Department of the Institute for the History of Science and Technology (IHST) of the Academy of Sciences of the USSR (Scientific Heritage, vol. 17), as the main source of information about Steklov's life and work, the development of his personality, and his mathematical and public career. The article highlights the decisive role Vladimir Steklov played in the formation of the Russian Academy of Sciences as the successor of the Imperial St. Petersburg Academy of Sciences and its transformation into the Academy of Sciences of the USSR. The information about Vladimir Steklov's contribution to this area comes from the archives of the Russian Academy of Sciences and from Science in the First Years of Soviet Rule (1917-1925), a collection of documents published by the Leningrad Department of the IHST in 1968. The article also summarizes Vladimir Steklov's scientific achievements in mathematical physics and mechanics.	[Kozlov, V. V.; Pavlov, V. P.; Sergeev, A.

Perturbation theory for the stress tensor in the Moon's body with tidal effects taken into account	PROCEEDINGS OF THE STEKLOV INSTITUTE OF MATHEMATICS			English	Article								On the basis of the seismic data from the Apollo project, we show that one can use linear elasticity theory to process these data, which yields information on the mechanical parameters of the Moon's body with an accuracy of 10%. Within this theory, we obtain a theoretical formula for the dependence of pressure on depth in the Moon's body in the presence of tidal effects. We also derive theoretical dependence of the variations of the free energy density due to tidal effects on latitude and depth. In all these formulas the contribution of shear stresses is taken into account. It turns out that the main contribution is made by the Earth tides. Estimates for the dissipation of the energy of tidal oscillations show that this energy is certainly enough to explain where the energy released in deep focus moonquakes comes from.

The fact that the author of the present work is a distant family member of the literary critic and essay writer Nikolay Dobrolyubov accounts for some new information and the unusual way it is presented in the paper. Vladimir Steklov occupies a special place in the author's book Nizhny Novgorod's Intelligentsia: The Nikolay Dobrolyubov Circle as he was the son of Ekaterina, one of Nikolay's younger sisters. Dobrolyubov was both Steklov's relative and his kindred spirit. He always remained an icon for Steklov, which explains the scientist's desire to be buried near his renowned uncle at the Volkovo Cemetery. The distinct qualities of a patriot and citizen were nurtured in the future mathematician from his childhood, and he developed them during his life in Nizhny Novgorod.

Lower Estimates for the Error of Approximation of Derivatives for Composite Finite Elements with Smoothness Property	PROCEEDINGS OF THE STEKLOV INSTITUTE OF MATHEMATICS			English	Article						multidimensional interpolation; finite element method; smallest angle condition; splines on triangulations	ANGLE CONDITION; INTERPOLATION; POLYNOMIALS	We consider a natural class of composite finite elements that provide the mth-order smoothness of the resulting piecewise polynomial function on a triangulated domain and do not require any information on neighboring elements. It is known that, to provide a required convergence rate in the finite element method, the "smallest angle condition" must be often imposed on the triangulation of the initial domain; i.e., the smallest possible values of the smallest angles of the triangles must be lower bounded. On the other hand, the negative role of the smallest angle can be weakened (but not eliminated completely) by choosing appropriate interpolation conditions. As shown earlier, for a large number of methods of choosing interpolation conditions in the construction of simple (noncomposite) finite elements, including traditional conditions, the influence of the smallest angle of the triangle on the error of approximation of derivatives of a function by derivatives of the interpolation polynomial is essential for a number of derivatives of order 2 and higher for m >= 1. In the present paper, a similar result is proved for some class of composite finite elements.	[Baidakova, N.

This problem arises from the Delsarte method of finding an upper bound for the kissing number in the three-dimensional Euclidean space. We prove that the problem has a unique solution, which is a polynomial of degree 27. This polynomial is a linear combination of Legendre polynomials of degrees 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 9, 10, 20, and 27 with positive coefficients; it has simple root 1/2 and five double roots in (-1, 1/2).

We assume that the pair of variables (v, p) satisfies a system of equations that includes Euler's equation and the incompressible fluid continuity equation. For the case of an axially symmetric cylindrical layer D, we find a general solution of this system of equations in the class of vector fields v whose lines for any t >= 0 coincide everywhere in D with their vortex lines and lie on axially symmetric cylindrical surfaces nested in D. The general solution is characterized in a theorem. As an example, we specify a family of solutions expressed in terms of cylindrical functions, which, for D = R-3, includes a particular solution obtained for the first time by I.S.

In this paper we provide lower and upper bounds on the minimum number of open sets, not containing a pair of antipodal points, needed to cover the d-dimensional sphere n times, with the additional property that the northern hemisphere is covered m > n times. We prove that if the open northern hemisphere is to be covered m times, then at least aOE(d - 1)/2aOE parts per thousand + n + m and at most d + n + m sets are needed. For the case of n = 1 and d a parts per thousand yen 2, this number is equal to d + 2 if m a parts per thousand currency sign aOESd/2aOE < + 1 and equal to aOES(d - 1)/2aOE < + 2 + m if m > aOESd/2aOE < + 1. If the closed northern hemisphere is to be covered m times, then d + 2m - 1 sets are needed; this number is also sufficient. We also present results on a related problem of independent interest. We prove that if S (d) is covered n times with open sets not containing a pair of antipodal points, then there exists a point that is covered at least aOEd/2aOE parts per thousand + n times. Furthermore, we show that there are covers in which no point is covered more than n + d times.

Geometry of lifts of tilings of Euclidean spaces	PROCEEDINGS OF THE STEKLOV INSTITUTE OF MATHEMATICS			English	Article							VORONOIS CONJECTURE; QUADRATIC-FORMS; PARALLELOHEDRA	The method of canonical scalings is substantiated for lifts of tilings of Euclidean space. A new combinatorial-geometric approach to the construction of a generatrix of a tiling is proposed. The construction is based on a simple and geometrically transparent operation of lifting a face to an earlier lifted neighbor. The approach is applied to the fundamental theorem of polytope theory related to the classical problem of validity of Voronoi's conjecture for parallelotopes. So far Voronoi's conjecture has been proved only for some special families of parallelotopes, and the theorem states that Voronoi's conjecture holds for a given parallelotope P if and only if there exists a canonical scaling for the corresponding tiling T (P) . A new, significantly shortened (compared with the available ones), geometric proof of this fundamental theorem is given.	[Gavrilyuk, A.

J	Grishukhin, VP				Grishukhin, V. P.			Parallelohedra defined by quadratic forms	PROCEEDINGS OF THE STEKLOV INSTITUTE OF MATHEMATICS			English	Article								The results of Section III of G.F. Voronoi's famous memoir are presented in modern terms. The description of a parallelohedron by a system of linear constraints with quadratic right-hand side naturally leads to the notion of a contact face, which is called a standard face by N.P. Dolbilin. It is proved that a nonempty intersection of two contact faces generates a 4- or 6-belt of these contact faces. As an example, zonotopes defined by quadratic forms are considered. In particular, zonotopal parallelohedra of Voronoi's principal domain are examined in detail. It is shown that these parallelohedra are submodular polytopes, which are frequently encountered in combinatorial theory.
