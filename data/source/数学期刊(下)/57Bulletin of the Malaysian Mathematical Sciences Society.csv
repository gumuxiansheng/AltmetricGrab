The Undirected Power Graph of a Finite Group	BULLETIN OF THE MALAYSIAN MATHEMATICAL SCIENCES SOCIETY			English	Article						Power graph; Hamiltonian graph; 2-Connected graph; Simple group		The power graph P(G) of a group G is the graph which has a vertex set of the group elements and two elements are adjacent if one is a power of the other. Chakrabarty, Ghosh, and Sen proved the main properties of the undirected power graph of a finite group. The aim of this paper is to generalize some results of their work and presenting some counterexamples for one of the problems raised by these authors. It is also proved that the power graph of a p-group is 2-connected if and only if the group is a cyclic or generalized quaternion group and if G is a nilpotent group which is not of prime power order then the power graph P(G) is 2-connected. We also prove that the number of edges of the power graph of the simple groups is less than or equal to the number of edges in the power graph of the cyclic group of the same order. This partially answers to a question in an earlier paper. Finally, we give a complete classification of groups in which the power graph is a union of complete graphs sharing a common vertex.

The dimensionless governing equations for this investigation are solved analytically using small perturbation approximation. With the help of graphs, the effects of the various important parameters entering into the problem on the velocity, microrotation, temperature, and concentration fields within the boundary layer are separately discussed. Finally the effects of the pertinent parameters on the skin friction coefficient, couple stress coefficient, Nusselt number, and Sherwood number at the wall are presented numerically in tabular form. In addition, the results obtained show that these parameters have significant influence on the flow, heat and mass transfer.

On the basis of these background details, we study oscillatory behavior of a class of second-order neutral functional dynamic equations on a time scale. New criteria improve and complement related results reported in the literature. Some examples are included to illustrate the results obtained. In particular, an example regarding the second-order neutral differential equation is also provided to show that these theorems improve those in the continuous case.

We also give new series expansions of the matrix functions exp(xB), sin(xB), cos(xB), cosh(xB) and sinh(xB) in terms of these generalized Hermite matrix polynomials and thus prove that many of the seemingly different generalizations of the Hermite matrix polynomials may be viewed as particular cases of the two-variable polynomials introduced here.

Given a positive integer p, denote by e(p)(G) = Sigma(n)(i)=(1)d(i)(p). Caro and Yuster introduced a Turan-type problem for e(p)(G): given an integer p, how large can e(p)(G) be if G has no subgraph of a particular type. They got some results for the subgraph of particular type to be a clique of order r + 1 and a cycle of even length, respectively. Denote by ex(p)(n, H) the maximum value of e(p)(G) taken over all graphs with n vertices that do not contain H as a subgraph. Clearly, ex(1)(n, H) = 2ex(n, H), where ex(n, H) denotes the classical Turan number. In this paper, we consider ex(p)(n, C-5) and prove that for any positive integer p and sufficiently large n, there exists a constant c = c(p) such that the following holds: if ex(p)(n, C-5) = e(p)(G) for some C-5-free graph G of order n, then G is a complete bipartite graph having one vertex class of size cn + o(n) and the other (1 - c) n + o(n).

The concept of third-order differential subordination in the unit disk was introduced by Antonino and Miller, and studied recently by Tang and Deniz. Let Omega be a set in the complex plane C, let p(z) be analytic in the unit disk U = {z : z is an element of C and vertical bar z vertical bar < 1}, and let psi : C-4 x U -> C. In this paper, we investigate the problem of determining properties of functions p(z) that satisfy the following third-order differential superordination: Omega subset of {psi (p(Z), Zp ' (Z), Z(2)p ''(Z), Z(3)p '''(Z); Z) : Z is an element of U}. As applications, we derive some third-order differential superordination results for analytic functions in U, which are associated with a family of generalized Bessel functions. The results are obtained by considering suitable classes of admissible functions. New third-order differential sandwich-type results are also obtained.

But there are some physical models which cannot be described by such processes. One of such models is related to population genetics. These processes are called quadratic stochastic processes (q.s.p.). In the present paper, we associate to given q.s.p. two kind of processes, which call marginal processes. Note that one of them is Markov process. We prove that such kind of processes uniquely define q.s.p. Moreover, we provide a construction of nontrivial examples of q.s.p. Weak ergodicity of q.s.p. is also studied in terms of the marginal processes.

By analyzing the corresponding characteristic equations, the local stability of the equilibria is discussed. Hopf bifurcations occurring at the positive equilibrium under some conditions are demonstrated. Taking time delay as bifurcating parameter, the direction and stability of Hopf bifurcation are carried out. The global continuation of periodic solutions bifurcating from the equilibrium is investigated. Finally, an example and numerical simulations are given.

It is assumed that the force applied to upper free surface of the plate-strip is time-harmonic and the materials used are linearly elastic, homogenous, and isotropic. By employing finite element method, the governing system of partial differential equations of motion is approximately solved. The different dependencies of the problem such as the ratio of height of plates and initial stress of the materials are numerically investigated. Particularly the effect of arbitrary inclined force is analyzed. It is observed that the numerical results obtained according to various angles converge to the ones in the previous studies.

The b-chromatic index of trees is determined and equals either to a natural upper bound m'(T) or one less, where m'(T) is connected with the number of edges of high degree. Some conditions are given for which graphs have the b-chromatic index strictly less than m'(G), and for which conditions it is exactly m'(G). In the last part of the paper, regular graphs are considered. It is proved that with four exceptions, the b-chromatic index of cubic graphs is 5. The exceptions are K-4, K-3,K-3, the prism over K-3, and the cube Q(3).

J	Li, W; Zhang, HP				Li, Wei; Zhang, Heping			On the Permanental Polynomials of Matrices	BULLETIN OF THE MALAYSIAN MATHEMATICAL SCIENCES SOCIETY			English	Article						Permanent; Permanental polynomial; Pfaffian orientation; Determinant	GRAPHS	An m x n {0, 1}-matrix A is said to be totally convertible if there exists a matrix B obtained from A by changing some 1's in A to -1's such that for any submatrix A' of A of order m, the corresponding submatrix B' of B satisfies per(xI - A') = det(x I - B'). In this paper, motivated by the well-known Polya's problem, our object is to characterize those totally convertible matrices. Associate a matrix A with a bipartite graph G(A)*. We first prove that a square matrix A is totally convertible if and only if G(A)* is Pfaffian, and then we generalize this result to an m x n {0, 1}-matrix. Moreover, the characterization of a totally convertible matrix provides an equivalent condition to compute the permanental polynomial of a bipartite graph by the characteristic polynomial of the skew adjacency matrix of its orientation graph. As applications, we give some explicit expressions of the permanental polynomials of two totally convertible matrices by the technique of Pfaffian orientation.

Then, S* = {x*|x is an element of S} is called a regular *-transversal of S in the literatures.

The U-radius is obtained for several classes of functions. These include the class of normalized analytic functions f satisfying the inequality Re f (z)/g(z) > 0 or vertical bar f (z)/g(z) -1 vertical bar < 1 in D, where g belongs to a certain class of functions, the class of functions f satisfying vertical bar f' (z) - 1 vertical bar < 1 in D, and functions f satisfying Re f (z)/z > alpha, 0 <= alpha < 1, in D.

The paper deals with the subclass F-(n) of these functions f which satisfy the property f (epsilon z) = epsilon f (z) for all z is an element of Delta, where epsilon = e(2 pi i/n). The functions of this subclass are called n-fold symmetric. For F-(n), where n is odd positive integer, the following sets, boolean AND (f is an element of F(n)) f(Delta)-the Koebe set and boolean OR (f is an element of F(n)) f (Delta)-the covering set, are discussed.

Let a (not equivalent to 0) be a holomorphic function in a domain D of C such that multiplicities of zeros of a are at most m and divisible by n + 1. In this paper, we mainly obtain the following normality criterion: Let F be the family of meromorphic functions on D such that multiplicities of zeros of each f is an element of F are at least k + m and such that multiplicities of poles of f are at least m + 1. If each pair (f, g) of F satisfies that f(n)f(k) and g(n)g(k) share a (ignoring multiplicity), then F is normal.

However, the sampling distribution is difficult for other distributions, and more so if the observations are neither independently nor identically distributed. We demonstrate that the expected value in such a general situation depends on the second moment of the difference of pairs of its constituent random variables. We also prove, for this situation, an expression for expected variance that depends on the average of variances of observations, variation among true means, and the average of covariances of pairs of observations. Many special cases are expressed as corollaries to illustrate ideas. Some examples that provide insights in mathematical statistics are considered. An application to textile engineering is presented.

The author first establishes the comparison principle and local existence theorem for the above problem. Then under appropriate hypotheses, the author proves that the solution either exists globally or blows up in finite time depends on the initial data and the relations of the parameters in the system.

A one-to-one correspondence between the 4-adic expansion of the unit interval and the fractal curve's iterative generating process is established, and an analytical expression of the level-n Hilbert curve is obtained. This expression can take limit and represent the curve with 2-adic series. Although composition of functions this expression can substitute the generator of the Hilbert curve, while it can be proved, using the expression, that the generation of the Hilbert curve depends on how the subsquares are connected rather than the shape of the generator.

The global existence of generalized solutions is obtained constructively using generalized Rankine-Hugoniot conditions and the entropy condition. Moreover, a new kind of nonclassical wave appears, namely a delta contact discontinuity, which is a Dirac delta function supported on a contact discontinuity. Furthermore, it can be found that the generalized solutions are stable by making use of the perturbation of the initial data.

The matrix Q(G) = D(G) + A(G) is called the signless Laplacian of G, where D(G) = diag(d(v(1)), d(v(2)),..., d(v(n))) and A(G) denote the diagonal matrix of vertex degrees and the adjacency matrix of G, respectively. Let q(1)(G) be the largest eigenvalue of Q(G). We first give some upper and lower bounds on q(1)(G) + q(1)(G(c)) for a graph G.

If k >= 1 is an integer and Sigma(x is an element of N-[v]) f (x) >= k for each v is an element of V(D), where N-[v] consists of v and all vertices of D from which arcs go into v, then f is a signed k-dominating function on D. A set {f(1), f(2),..., f(d)} of distinct signed k-dominating functions on D with the property that Sigma(d)(i=1) f(i) (x) <= k for each x is an element of V(D), is called a signed (k, k)-dominating family (of functions) on D. The maximum number of functions in a signed (k, k)-dominating family on D is the signed (k, k)-domatic number of D. In this article, we mainly present upper bounds on the signed (k, k)-domatic number, in particular for regular digraphs.

We prove that a bipartite graph is Cohen-Macaulay if and only if it is well covered and has a unique perfect matching.

We put some chips on each vertex of , we say that a vertex is ready if it has at least as many chips as its degree, in which case we can fire it and the result is that it distributes one chip to each of its neighbors, this may cause other vertices to be ready, and so on. This game continues until no vertex can be fired. In this paper, we study chip-firing games on complete graphs. We obtain a sufficient and necessary condition for chip-firing games on complete graphs to be finite.

It is proved that, for a given set X, appropriate order relation <= can be defined on MCCFN (X) (the set of all Moore convergence classes of families of nets on X) and a one-to-one correspondence tau : (MCCFN(X), <=) -> (MS(X), superset of) (the set of all Moore systems on the set X) can be defined such that (MCCFN(X), <=) is a complete lattice and tau is a complete lattice isomorphism. This means that Moore systems and Moore convergence classes of families of nets are cryptomorphic mathematical structures. It is also proved (by considering the restrictions of tau) that pre-cotopologies and pre-convergence classes of families of nets are cryptomorphic mathematical structures and that cotopologies and convergence classes of nets are cryptomorphic mathematical structures (a classical result). This naturally gives a new approach to a Moore system and a pre-cotopology.

G. Thompson put forward the following conjecture: Let G be a finite group with trivial center. If L is a finite simple group satisfying that N(G) = N(L), then G congruent to L. The second author proved above conjecture holds for finite simple groups with non-connected prime graphs. Vasilev proved above conjecture holds for two simple groups with connected prime graphs: A(10) and L-4(4). N. Ahanjideh proved that Thompson's conjecture is true for L-n(q). The authors are interested in if it is possible to weaken the conditions in the conjecture. A finite simple group is called a simple K-n-group if its order is divisible by exactly n distinct primes. Here, the authors prove that simple K-4-groups are characterized by their orders and few special conjugacy class sizes, which implies that Thompson's conjecture is valid for simple K-4-groups.

In this paper, we investigate the extent to which these characterizations can be made beyond Banach algebras. We shall focus mainly on the algebras of continuous functions with values in an F-algebra A (not necessarily locally convex), in particular in a complete p-normed algebra, 0 < p <= 1, having a minimal approximate identity. We include a few examples related to our results. Most of our initial results remain valid without the commutativity of A.

Almost Quaternionic Structures on Quaternionic Kaehler Manifolds	BULLETIN OF THE MALAYSIAN MATHEMATICAL SCIENCES SOCIETY			English	Article						Subbundle; Almost complex structure; Almost quaternionic structure; Torsion tensor		In this work, we consider a Riemannian manifold M with an almost quaternionic structure V defined by a three-dimensional subbundle of (1, 1) tensors F, G, and H such that {F, G, H} is chosen to be a local basis for V. For such a manifold there exits a subbundle H(M) of the bundle of orthonormal frames O(M). If M admits a torsion-free connection reducible to a connection in H(M), then we give a condition such that the torsion tensor of the bundle vanishes. We also prove that if M admits a torsion-free connection reducible to a connection in H(M), then the tensors (F-2) over tilde, (G(2)) over tilde, and (H-2) over tilde are torsion-free, that is, they are integrable. Here (F-2) over tilde, (G(2)) over tilde,(H-2) over tilde are the extended tensors of F, G, and H defined on M. Finally, we show that if the torsions of (F-2) over tilde, (G(2)) over tilde, and (H-2) over tilde vanish, then M admits a connection with torsion which is reducible to H(M), and this means that (F-2) over tilde, (G(2)) over tilde, and (H-2) over tilde are integrable.
