In process, we observe that various kinds of binary relations, such as partial order, preorder, transitive relation, tolerance, strict order, symmetric closure, etc., utilized by earlier authors in several well-known metrical fixed point theorems can be weakened to the extent of an arbitrary binary relation.

We show that under certain assumptions the method can be applied to variational inequalities defined over the common fixed point set of a given infinite family of cutter operators. The main step of our method consists in the computation of the metric projection onto a certain superhalf- space, which is constructed using the input data defining the problem. Moreover, in the case where the common fixed point set is a finite intersection of the fixed point sets of cutters for which Opial's closedness principle holds, we show that the iterative method can be easily combined with either sequential, composition or convex combination type methods. We also discuss ways of applying our method to more general classes of operators such as quasi-nonexpansive and demi-contractive ones.

In many instances a weakened form of the triangle inequality is involved and the space is assumed to be complete. Thus Cauchy sequences play a central role. One of the standard tests to determine when a sequence is Cauchy in a metric space (X, d) is the summation criterion: If and , then {p (n) } is Cauchy. In this note we examine instances in which this criterion plays a critical role.	[Kirk, W.

Because the underlined space of this theorem is a metric space, the theory that developed following its publication is known as the metric fixed point theory. Over the last one hundred years, many people have tried to generalize the definition of a metric space. In this paper, we survey the most popular generalizations and we discuss the recent uptick in some generalizations and their impact in metric fixed point theory.	[Khamsi, M.

Then, the inexact proximal point algorithm for approximation of a solution of the variational inequality, which is also a fixed point of the nonexpansive mapping, is proposed. We prove the -convergence of the generated sequence by the algorithm as well as the strong convergence of a Halpern-type regularization one to a fixed point of the nonexpansive mapping. Our motivation is to give a step toward investigation of variational inequalities in CAT(0) spaces.

We focus on the case when F is defined on a proper (closed convex) subset of X only rather than on the whole of X. Three possible ways of approximating F around the reference point are considered. First, we use a tangential approximation by set-valued mappings associated with the Bouligand's tangent cone to the graph of F. Then we move on to approximations by positively homogeneous set-valued mappings whose graphs contain the graph of F, for example, by the strict prederivative. Finally, we use an approximation by bunches of continuous linear operators. In the first two cases finding approximating objects is relatively easy while in the third case the approximating object is very convenient to work with. On examples, we illustrate that these approaches are different and neither of them implies the other, unless the spaces in question are finite dimensional.

By exploiting the exact nature of this relationship for all powers of f, we prove that the Nielsen dynamical zeta function for a map on an infra-nilmanifold is always a rational function.

One of our objectives is to provide a simple proof to a more general version of a well-known result due to Bruck which states that if a Banach space has the weak fixed point property, then it has the weak fixed point property for commuting semigroups. As a consequence, we obtain that if a dual Banach space E with a separable predual has the weak* fixed point property and the fixed point property for spheres, then E has the weak* fixed point property for commuting semigroups. This is done through analysis of existence of the so-called retractions.

We show that the SO(d)-orbits of fixed points of F are all fixed points of the map induced on the quotient by SO(d), and we give a formula relating their indices (as fixed points) with their Morse indices (as critical points). At the end, we give an example of a nonplanar relative equilibrium which is not a central configuration.

With additional structures on the inward and outward boundaries of a conical region, the theorems can be used to prove the existence of solutions of boundary value problems for nonlinear differential equations with dependence on higher-order derivatives, and they can provide nonlocal upper and lower bounds on the solutions.

The model consists of a system of nonlinear parabolic PDEs in conservation form expressing conservation of energy, mass and charge. On the other hand, an integral form of Newton's law is used to describe heat exchange at the electrolyte/electrode interface, a nonlinear radiation condition is enforced on the heat flux at the wall and a nonlinear boundary condition is considered for the electrochemical flux in order to account for Butler-Volmer kinetics. The main objective is the nonconstant character of each parameter, that is, the coefficients are assumed to be dependent on the spatial variable and the temperature. Making recourse of known estimates of solutions for some auxiliary elliptic and parabolic problems, which are explicitly determined by the Gehring-Giaquinta-Modica theory, we find sufficient smallness conditions on the data to guarantee the existence of the original solutions via the Schauder fixed point argument. These conditions may provide useful information for numerical as well as real applications. We conclude with an example of application, namely the electrolysis of molten sodium chloride.			lconsiglieri@gmail.com	Consiglieri, Luisa/E-3695-2010	Consiglieri, Luisa/0000-0002-1002-3711				35	0	0	0	0	SPRINGER BASEL AG	BASEL	PICASSOPLATZ 4, BASEL, 4052, SWITZERLAND	1661-7738	1661-7746		J FIX POINT THEORY A	J.

Boyd [Duke Math. J. 44 (1977), 315-328] showed that, for n > deg P - 2 P'(1)/P(1), Q is the product of cyclotomic polynomials and the minimal polynomial of a Salem number, say alpha. In this paper, we study the dynamics of the Newton map N = z - Q/Q' induced by Q in the immediate basin U-alpha of alpha. We establish that N is a 2-fold covering map of U-alpha onto itself. Furthermore, there exists a conformal mapping phi of U-alpha onto the open unit disk D such that (phi circle N circle phi(-1))(z) = z(2) for all z is an element of D.

In the special case n = 2, we classify the homotopy types of periodic homotopy idempotents on T-2 using an elementary number-theoretic discussion.

J	Koschorke, U				Koschorke, Ulrich			Coincidences and secondary Nielsen numbers	JOURNAL OF FIXED POINT THEORY AND APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Coincidence; Nielsen number; minimum number; Wecken theorem; Kervaire invariant	INVARIANTS	Let be maps between smooth connected manifolds of dimensions m and n. Can f (1), f (2) be deformed by homotopies until they are coincidence free (i.e., for all ? The main tool for addressing such a problem is traditionally the (primary) Nielsen number N(f (1), f (2)). For example, when m < 2n - 2, the question above has a positive answer precisely if N(f (1), f (2)) = 0. However, when m = 2n - 2, this can be dramatically wrong, e.g. in the fixed point case when m = n = 2. Also, in a very specific setting the Kervaire invariant appears as a (full) additional obstruction. In this paper we start exploring a fairly general new approach. This leads to secondary Nielsen numbers SecN(f (1), f (2)) which allow us to answer our question, e.g., when , is even and Y is simply connected.
