Bloch, Besov and Dirichlet Spaces of Slice Hyperholomorphic Functions	COMPLEX ANALYSIS AND OPERATOR THEORY			English	Article						Bloch spaces; Besov spaces; Dirichlet spaces; Slice hyperholomorphic functions	NONCOMMUTING OPERATORS; CALCULUS	In this paper we begin the study of some important Banach spaces of slice hyperholomorphic functions, namely the Bloch, Besov and weighted Bergman spaces, and we also consider the Dirichlet space, which is a Hilbert space. The importance of these spaces is well known, and thus their study in the framework of slice hyperholomorphic functions is relevant, especially in view of the fact that this class of functions has recently found several applications in operator theory and in Schur analysis. We also discuss the property of invariance of these function spaces with respect to Mobius maps by using a suitable notion of composition.	[Castillo Villalba, C.

In particular, we exhibit uncountably many discs in the ball of which are multiplier biholomorphic but have non-isomorphic multiplier algebras. We also show that there are closed discs in the ball of which are varieties, and examine their multiplier algebras. In finite balls, we provide a counterpoint to a result of Alpay, Putinar and Vinnikov by providing a proper rational biholomorphism of the disc onto a variety in such that the multiplier algebra is not all of . We also show that the transversality property, which is one of their hypotheses, is a consequence of the smoothness that they require.

It is based on the application of hyperbolic pseudoanalytic function theory and recent results on mapping properties of the transmutation operators. The kernel of the transmutation operator relating and turns out to be one of the complex components of a bicomplex-valued hyperbolic pseudoanalytic function satisfying a Vekua-type hyperbolic equation of a special form. The other component of the pseudoanalytic function is the kernel of the transmutation operator relating and where is obtained from by a Darboux transformation. We prove an expansion theorem and a Runge-type theorem for this special hyperbolic Vekua equation and using several known results from hyperbolic pseudoanalytic function theory together with the recently discovered mapping properties of the transmutation operators we obtain a new representation for their kernels. Several examples are given. Moreover, approaches for numerical computation of the transmutation kernels and for numerical solution of spectral problems are proposed.

It is frequently carried out in dimension reduction either for functional data or in a high dimensional framework. To that aim PCA yields the eigenvectors of the covariance operator of a sample of interest. Dimension reduction is obtained by projecting on the eigenspaces spanned by the 's usually endowed with nice properties in terms of optimal information. We focus on the empirical eigenprojectors in the functional PCA of a -sample and prove several non asymptotic results. More specifically we provide an upper bound for their mean square risk. This rate does not depend on the rate of decrease of the eigenvalues which seems to be a new result. We also derive a lower bound on the risk. The latter matches the upper bound up to a term. The results are applied in a nonparametric functional estimation model.

It is a fundamental tool to construct a relativistic quantum field theory as a unitary representation of the Poincar, group from a non-relativistic field theory as a representation of the euclidean motion group. This is the second article in a series on the mathematical foundations of reflection positivity. We develop the theory of reflection positive one-parameter groups and the dual theory of dilations of contractive hermitian semigroups. In particular, we connect reflection positivity with the outgoing realization of unitary one-parameter groups by Lax and Phillips. We further show that our results provide effective tools to construct reflection positive representations of general symmetric Lie groups, including the -group, the Heisenberg group, the euclidean motion group and the euclidean conformal group.

A Fundamental Theorem on Initial Value Problems by Using the Theory of Reproducing Kernels	COMPLEX ANALYSIS AND OPERATOR THEORY			English	Article						Initial value problem; Eigenfunction; Eigenvalue; Integral transform; Integral equation; Aveiro discretization method; Reproducing kernel; Inverse problem	SINGULAR INTEGRAL-EQUATIONS	We introduce a new method for solving general initial value problems by using the theory of reproducing kernels. The results are depending on the specific structure of each problem. Here, we give the general principle of the method and illustrate it with simple prototype examples. On the basis of the process, we have certain integral transforms, which are generated by each specific initial value problem, and need to be analysed. In view of this, we shall establish the basic relations among initial value problems for linear operator equations, eigenvalues and eigenfunctions in the related operator equations, integral transforms and associated reproducing kernels. Within this process, we will realize a general theory for operator equations and incorporate a time dependence in view to consider an associated regularization method.	[Castro, L. P.; Rodrigues, M.

The convolution of with other harmonic mappings, eg. half-plane mappings, is not necessarily univalent in . In this paper, under suitable restriction on the dilatation of , we show that the convolutions of with certain slanted half-plane harmonic mappings are necessarily convex in a direction. In addition, we consider a fixed harmonic mapping and with the dilatation , where denotes the class of asymmetric vertical strip mappings. We find the relationship between and such that is a sense-preserving univalent harmonic mapping and is convex in some direction. These results are a generalization of the corresponding recent result of Dorff et al..

Based on this extension principle, fractional Fueter polynomials, forming a basis of the space of fractional spherical monogenics, i.e. fractional homogeneous polynomials, are introduced.

Two classes of symbols are considered here: symbols that depend only on the vertical variable and symbols that depend only on the angular variable. For the first case, we prove that Toeplitz operators with such kind of symbols generate a commutative -algebra in every weighted harmonic Bergman space. This algebra is isomorphic to the algebra of all very slowly oscillating functions. On the other hand, Toeplitz operators whose symbols depend only on the angular variable generate a non commutative C*-algebra which is isomorphic to the C*-algebra of all 2 x 2 matrix-valued continuous functions (f(ij)(t)) defined on [-infinity, infinity] and such that they satisfy f(12)(+/-infinity) = f(21)(+/-infinity) = 0 and f(11)(+/-infinity) = f(22)(-/+infinity).

The problem of expressing parametrices of Shapiro-Lopatinskij elliptic boundary value problems for differential operators gives rise to pseudo-differential operators with the transmission property at the boundary. However, there are interesting pseudo-differential operators without the transmission property, for instance, the Dirichlet-to-Neumann operator. In this case the symbols become edge-degenerate under a suitable quantisation, cf. Chang et al. (J Pseudo-Differ Oper Appl 5(2014):69-155, 2014). If the boundary itself has singularities, e.g., conical points or edges, then the symbols are corner-degenerate. In the present paper we study elements of the corresponding corner pseudo-differential calculus.

Such a function is said to be in the Schur-Agler class if it is contractive when evaluated on any commutative -tuple of strict contractions on a Hilbert space. It is known that the Schur-Agler class is a strictly proper subclass of the Schur class if the number of variables is more than two. The Schur-Agler class is also characterized as those functions arising as the transfer function of a certain type (Givone-Roesser) of conservative multidimensional linear system. Previous work of the authors identified the Schur-Agler class as those Schur-class functions which arise as the scattering matrix for a certain type of (not necessarily minimal) Lax-Phillips multievolution scattering system having some additional geometric structure. The present paper links this additional geometric scattering structure directly with a known reproducing-kernel characterization of the Schur-Agler class. We use extensively the technique of formal reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces that was previously introduced by the authors and that allows us to manipulate formal power series in several commuting variables and their inverses (e.g., Fourier series of elements of on a torus) in the same way as one manipulates analytic functions in the usual setting of reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces.

Functional Models and Minimal Contractive Liftings	COMPLEX ANALYSIS AND OPERATOR THEORY			English	Article						Characteristic function; Minimal contractive lifting; Row contraction; Multi-analytic; Completely non-coisometric; Schur function	NONCOMMUTING OPERATORS; INFINITE SEQUENCES	Based on a careful analysis of functional models for contractive multi-analytic operators we establish a one-to-one correspondence between unitary equivalence classes of minimal contractive liftings of a row contraction and injective symbols of contractive multi-analytic operators. This allows an effective construction and classification of all such liftings with given defects. Popescu's theory of characteristic functions of completely non-coisometric row contractions is obtained as a special case satisfying a Szego condition. In another special case of single contractions and defects equal to 1 all non-zero Schur functions on the unit disk appear in the classification. It is also shown that the process of constructing liftings iteratively reflects itself in a factorization of the corresponding symbols.

Stacey			Kravchuk Polynomials and Induced/Reduced Operators on Clifford Algebras	COMPLEX ANALYSIS AND OPERATOR THEORY			English	Article						Operator calculus; Kravchuk polynomials; Clifford algebras; Quantum probability	KRAWTCHOUK POLYNOMIALS; BOUNDS; CODES	Kravchuk polynomials arise as orthogonal polynomials with respect to the binomial distribution and have numerous applications in harmonic analysis, statistics, coding theory, and quantum probability. The relationship between Kravchuk polynomials and Clifford algebras is multifaceted. In this paper, Kravchuk polynomials are discovered as traces of conjugation operators in Clifford algebras, and appear in Clifford Berezin integrals of Clifford polynomials. Regarding Kravchuk matrices as linear operators on a vector space , the action induced on the Clifford algebra over is equivalent to blade conjugation, i.e., reflections across sets of orthogonal hyperplanes. Such operators also have a natural interpretation in terms of raising and lowering operators on the algebra. On the other hand, beginning with particular linear operators on the Clifford algebra , one obtains Kravchuk matrices as operators on the paravector space through a process of operator grade-reduction. Symmetric Kravchuk matrices are recovered as representations of grade-reductions of maps induced by negative-definite quadratic forms on V.

J	Melnikov, A				Melnikov, Andrey			Classification of KdV Vessels with Constant Parameters and Two Dimensional Outer Space	COMPLEX ANALYSIS AND OPERATOR THEORY			English	Article								In this article we classify vessels producing solutions of some completely integrable partial differential equations (PDEs), presenting a unified approach for them. The classification includes such important examples as Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) and evolutionary non linear Schrodingier (ENLS) equations. In fact, employing basic matrix algebra techniques it is shown that there are exactly two canonical forms of such vessels, so that each canonical form generalize either KdV or ENLS equations. Particularly, Dirac canonical systems, whose evolution was recently inserted into the vessel theory, are shown to be equivalent to the ENLS equation in the sense of vessels. This work is important as a first step to a classification of completely integrable PDEs, which are solvable by the theory of vessels. We note that a recent paper of the author, published in Journal of Mathematical Physics, showed that initial value problem with analytic initial potential for the KdV equation has at least a "narrowing" in time solution. The presented classification inherits this idea and a similar theorem can be easily proved for the presented PDEs. Finally, the results of the work serve as a basis for the investigation of the following problems: (1) hierarchy of the generalized KdV, ENLS equations (by generalizing the vessel equations), (2) new completely integrable PDEs (by changing the dimension of the outer space), (3) addressing the question of integrability of a given arbitrary PDE (the future classification will create a list of solvable by vessels equations, which may eventually include many existing classes of PDEs).

Densely Defined Multiplication on Several Sobolev Spaces of a Single Variable	COMPLEX ANALYSIS AND OPERATOR THEORY			English	Article						Densely defined multiplication; Sobolev space; Reproducing Kernel Hilbert space; Unbounded multiplication; Function theory; Operator theory	MULTIPLIERS	Following Sarason's classification of the densely defined multiplication operators over the Hardy space, we classify the densely defined multipliers over the Sobolev space, . In this paper we find that the collection of such multipliers for the Sobolev space is exactly the Sobolev space itself, and each is a densely defined multiplier is bounded. This sharpens a result of Shields concerning bounded multipliers. The densely defined multiplication operators over the spaces and are also classified. In the case of , the densely defined multiplication operators can be written as a ratio of functions in where the denominator is non-vanishing. This is proved using a constructive argument.

J	Krausshar, RS; Tolksdorf, J				Krausshar, Rolf Soeren; Tolksdorf, Juergen			Applications of Hypercomplex Automorphic Forms in Yang-Mills Gauge Theories	COMPLEX ANALYSIS AND OPERATOR THEORY			English	Article						Yang-Mills gauge theory; SU(2) instantons; Quaternionic analyticity; Conformally flat manifolds; Hypercomplex argument principle; Chern numbers; Hypercomplex automorphic forms	DIRAC OPERATORS; SPIN MANIFOLDS; COMPLEX	In this paper we show how hypercomplex function theoretical objects can be used to construct explicitly self-dual -Yang-Mills instanton solutions on certain classes of conformally flat -manifolds. We use a hypercomplex argument principle to establish a natural link between the fundamental solutions of and the second Chern class of the principal bundles over these manifolds. The considered base manifolds of the bundles are not simply-connected, in general. Actually, this paper summarizes an extension of the corresponding results of Gursey and Tze on a hyper-complex analytical description of instantons. Furthermore, it provides an application of the recently introduced new classes of hypercomplex-analytic automorphic forms.

J	Melnikov, A; Vinnikov, V				Melnikov, Andrey; Vinnikov, Victor			Null/Pole Interpolation Problem in the Class of Rational Functions Intertwining Solutions of Linear Differential Equations	COMPLEX ANALYSIS AND OPERATOR THEORY			English	Article								We formulate and solve the null/pole interpolation problem for the class of rational matrix-valued functions intertwining solutions of linear ODEs with a spectral parameter; such functions appear naturally as transfer functions of overdetermined 2D systems invariant in one direction. The salient new feature, as compared to the usual null/pole interpolation problem for rational matrix-valued functions, is that the null and pole vectors are replaced by the null and pole solutions of the given ODEs for the values of the spectral parameter equal to the prescribed zeroes and poles. As a byproduct we obtain a realization theorem and a Hermitian (conservative) realization theorem.

Then we obtain a priori estimates of solutions of the modified Riemann-Hilbert problem, and derive the solvability results of the modified and original Riemann-Hilbert problems. Finally we shall verify the equivalence of two kinds of well-posed-ness for the Riemann-Hilbert boundary value problem.
