These desirable features have prompted its widespread adoption. Here, we analyse the interactions between a range of different strategies and the structure of transitions and outcomes in order to examine constraints on what can be learned from behavioural performance. The task involves a trade-off between the need for stochasticity, to allow strategies to be discriminated, and a need for determinism, so that it is worth subjects' investment of effort to exploit the contingencies optimally. We show through simulation that under certain conditions model-free strategies can masquerade as being model-based. We first show that seemingly innocuous modifications to the task structure can induce correlations between action values at the start of the trial and the subsequent trial events in such a way that analysis based on comparing successive trials can lead to erroneous conclusions. We confirm the power of a suggested correction to the analysis that can alleviate this problem. We then consider model-free reinforcement learning strategies that exploit correlations between where rewards are obtained and which actions have high expected value. These generate behaviour that appears model-based under these, and also more sophisticated, analyses. Exploiting the full potential of the two-step task as a tool for behavioural neuroscience requires an understanding of these issues.","[Akam, Thomas; Costa, Rui] Champalimaud Ctr, Champalimaud Neurosci Program, Lisbon, Portugal; [Akam, Thomas] Univ Oxford, Dept Expt Psychol, S Parks Rd, Oxford OX1 3UD, England; [Dayan, Peter] UCL, Gatsby Computat Neurosci Unit, London, England","Akam, T (reprint author), Champalimaud Ctr, Champalimaud Neurosci Program, Lisbon, Portugal.",thomas.akam@neuro.fchampalimaud.org,,,Wellcome Trust [WT096193AIA]; European Research Council [ERC COG 617142]; Howard Hughes Medical Institute [HHMI IEC 55007415]; Gatsby Charitable Foundation,"TA was funded by the Wellcome Trust (http://www.wellcome.ac.uk), grant number WT096193AIA.

This review offers a comprehensive biological background followed by comparative analysis of recent models of locust collective motion, in particular locust marching, their settings, and underlying assumptions. We describe a wide range of recent modeling and simulation approaches, from discrete agent-based models of self-propelled particles to continuous models of integro-differential equations, aimed at describing and analyzing the fascinating phenomenon of locust collective motion. These modeling efforts have a dual role: The first views locusts as a quintessential example of animal collective motion. As such, they aim at abstraction and coarse-graining, often utilizing the tools of statistical physics. The second, which originates from a more biological perspective, views locust swarming as a scientific problem of its own exceptional merit. The main goal should, thus, be the analysis and prediction of natural swarm dynamics. We discuss the properties of swarm dynamics using the tools of statistical physics, as well as the implications for laboratory experiments and natural swarms. Finally, we stress the importance of a combined-interdisciplinary, biological-theoretical effort in successfully confronting the challenges that locusts pose at both the theoretical and practical levels.","[Ariel, Gil] Bar Ilan Univ, Dept Math, Ramat Gan, Israel; [Ayali, Amir] Tel Aviv Univ, Dept Zool, Fac Life Sci, IL-69978 Tel Aviv, Israel; [Ayali, Amir] Tel Aviv Univ, Sagol Sch Neurosci, IL-69978 Tel Aviv, Israel","Ariel, G (reprint author), Bar Ilan Univ, Dept Math, Ramat Gan, Israel.",arielg@math.biu.ac.il; ayali@post.tau.ac.il,"Ayali, Amir/B-1050-2008","Ayali, Amir/0000-0001-6152-2927",EU Marie-Curie IRG grant; Israel's Ministry of Agriculture [891-0277-13],"GA's research has been partially supported by an EU Marie-Curie IRG grant.

To obtain detailed insight into this transfer process, we designed a novel model of Fa transfer dynamics from coronary plasma through the endothelial cells and interstitium to the cardiomyocyte, applying standard physicochemical principles on diffusion and on the chemical equilibrium of Fa binding to carrier proteins Cp, like albumin in plasma and interstitium and Fatty Acid-Binding Proteins within endothelium and cardiomyocytes. Applying these principles, the present model strongly suggests that in the heart, binding and release of Fa to and from Cp in the aqueous border zones on both sides of the cell membranes form the major hindrance to Fa transfer. Although often considered, the membrane itself appears not to be a significant hindrance to diffusion of Fa. Proteins, residing in the cellular membrane, may facilitate transfer of Fa between Cp and membrane. The model is suited to simulate multiple tracer dilution experiments performed on isolated rabbit hearts administrating albumin and Fa as tracer substances into the coronary arterial perfusion line. Using parameter values on myocardial ultrastructure and physicochemical properties of Fa and Cp as reported in literature, simulated washout curves appear to be similar to the experimentally determined ones. We conclude therefore that the model is realistic and, hence, can be considered as a useful tool to better understand Fa transfer by evaluation of experimentally determined tracer washout curves.","[Arts, Theo] Maastricht Univ, Dept Biomed Engn, CARIM, NL-6200 MD Maastricht, Netherlands; [Reneman, Robert S.; van der Vusse, Ger J.] Maastricht Univ, CARIM, Dept Physiol, NL-6200 MD Maastricht, Netherlands; [Reneman, Robert S.; Bassingthwaighte, James B.; van der Vusse, Ger J.] Univ Washington, Dept Bioengn, Seattle, WA 98195 USA","Arts, T (reprint author), Maastricht Univ, Dept Biomed Engn, CARIM, NL-6200 MD Maastricht, Netherlands.",t.arts@maastrichtuniversity.nl,,,NHLBI NIH HHS [U01 HL122199],,,50,2,2,0,1,PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE,SAN FRANCISCO,"1160 BATTERY STREET, STE 100, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94111 USA",1553-734X,1553-7358,,PLOS COMPUT BIOL,PLoS Comput.

In some situations, it is not clear how behavioural inhibition minimises harm or maximises benefit for the agent, and can even appear counterproductive. Extant explanations of this phenomenon make use of descriptive models but do not provide a formal assessment of its adaptive value. This hampers a better understanding of the neural computations underlying anxiety behaviour. Here, we analyse a standard rodent anxiety model, the operant conflict test. We harvest Bayesian Decision Theory to show that behavioural inhibition normatively arises as cost-minimising strategy in temporally correlated environments. Importantly, only if behavioural inhibition is aimed at minimising cost, it depends on probability and magnitude of threat. Harnessing a virtual computer game, we test model predictions in four experiments with human participants. Humans exhibit behavioural inhibition with a strong linear dependence on threat probability and magnitude. Strikingly, inhibition occurs before motor execution and depends on the virtual environment, thus likely resulting from a neural optimisation process rather than a preprogrammed mechanism. Individual trait anxiety scores predict behavioural inhibition, underlining the validity of this anxiety model. These findings put anxiety behaviour into the context of cost-minimisation and optimal inference, and may ultimately pave the way towards a mechanistic understanding of the neural computations gone awry in human anxiety disorder.","[Bach, Dominik R.] Univ Zurich, Dept Psychiat Psychotherapy & Psychosomat, Zurich, Switzerland; [Bach, Dominik R.] Univ Zurich, Neurosci Ctr Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland; [Bach, Dominik R.] UCL, Wellcome Trust Ctr Neuroimaging, London, England","Bach, DR (reprint author), Univ Zurich, Dept Psychiat Psychotherapy & Psychosomat, Zurich, Switzerland.",dominik.bach@uzh.ch,"Bach, Dominik/B-4302-2019","Bach, Dominik/0000-0003-3717-2036",University of Zurich; Wellcome Trust [091593/Z/10/Z],"This work was funded by the University of Zurich.

The accumulated data on experimentally determined structures transformed structure prediction of proteins and protein complexes. Instead of exploring the enormous search space, predictive tools can simply proceed to the solution based on similarity to the existing, previously determined structures. A similar major paradigm shift is emerging due to the rapidly expanding amount of information, other than experimentally determined structures, which still can be used as constraints in biomolecular structure prediction. Automated text mining has been widely used in recreating protein interaction networks, as well as in detecting small ligand binding sites on protein structures. Combining and expanding these two well-developed areas of research, we applied the text mining to structural modeling of protein-protein complexes (protein docking). Protein docking can be significantly improved when constraints on the docking mode are available. We developed a procedure that retrieves published abstracts on a specific protein-protein interaction and extracts information relevant to docking. The procedure was assessed on protein complexes from DOCKGROUND (http://dockground.compbio.ku.edu). The results show that correct information on binding residues can be extracted for about half of the complexes. The amount of irrelevant information was reduced by conceptual analysis of a subset of the retrieved abstracts, based on the bag-of-words (features) approach. Support Vector Machine models were trained and validated on the subset. The remaining abstracts were filtered by the best-performing models, which decreased the irrelevant information for similar to 25% complexes in the dataset. The extracted constraints were incorporated in the docking protocol and tested on the DOCKGROUND unbound benchmark set, significantly increasing the docking success rate.","[Badal, Varsha D.; Kundrotas, Petras J.; Vakser, Ilya A.] Univ Kansas, Ctr Computat Biol, Lawrence, KS 66045 USA; [Vakser, Ilya A.] Univ Kansas, Dept Mol Biosci, Lawrence, KS 66045 USA","Badal, VD (reprint author), Univ Kansas, Ctr Computat Biol, Lawrence, KS 66045 USA.",pkundro@ku.edu; vakser@ku.edu,,,NIH [R01GM074255]; NSF [DBI1262621],"This study was supported by NIH grant R01GM074255 and NSF grant DBI1262621.

The brain can tune the electrophysiological properties of synapses to regulate plasticity and information processing by switching from one protein variant to another. Such condition-dependent variant switch during development has been demonstrated in several neurotransmitter systems including NMDA and GABA. Here we systematically detect pairs of receptor-subunit variants that switch during the lifetime of the human brain by analyzing postmortem expression data collected in a population of donors at various ages and brain regions measured using microarray and RNA-seq. To further detect variant pairs that co-vary across subjects, we present a method to quantify age-corrected expression correlation in face of strong temporal trends. This is achieved by computing the correlations in the residual expression beyond a cubic-spline model of the population temporal trend, and can be seen as a nonlinear version of partial correlations. Using these methods, we detect multiple new pairs of context dependent variants. For instance, we find a switch from GLRA2 to GLRA3 that differs from the known switch in the rat. We also detect an early switch from HTR1A to HTR5A whose trends are negatively correlated and find that their age-corrected expression is strongly positively correlated. Finally, we observe that GRIN2B switch to GRIN2A occurs mostly during embryonic development, presumably earlier than observed in rodents. These results provide a systematic map of developmental switching in the neurotransmitter systems of the human brain.","[Bar-Shira, Ossnat; Maor, Ronnie; Chechik, Gal] Bar Ilan Univ, Gonda Brain Res Ctr, Ramat Gan, Israel","Chechik, G (reprint author), Google Res, Mountain View, CA USA.",gal.chechik@biu.ac.il,,,Israeli Science Foundation [1090/12]; Marie Curie reintegration [PIRG06-2009-256566],"This study was supported by a grant from the Israeli Science Foundation 1090/12 and by a Marie Curie reintegration grant PIRG06-2009-256566.

It also provides the opportunity to extensively revisit and refine the coupling between backbone states and inter base pair parameters, which emerges as a common theme across all the complementary dinucleotides.

Following this seminal result, much effort is put into the improvement of contact predictions. However, there is also a substantial need to develop structure prediction protocols tailored to the type of restraints gained by contact predictions. Here, we present a structure prediction protocol that combines evolutionary information with the resolution-adapted structural recombination approach of Rosetta, called RASREC. Compared to the classic Rosetta ab initio protocol, RASREC achieves improved sampling, better convergence and higher robustness against incorrect distance restraints, making it the ideal sampling strategy for the stated problem. To demonstrate the accuracy of our protocol, we tested the approach on a diverse set of 28 globular proteins. Our method is able to converge for 26 out of the 28 targets and improves the average TM-score of the entire benchmark set from 0.55 to 0.72 when compared to the top ranked models obtained by the EVFold web server using identical contact predictions. Using a smaller benchmark, we furthermore show that the prediction accuracy of our method is only slightly reduced when the contact prediction accuracy is comparatively low.

This tumor is usually benign and has a good prognosis. Total resection is the treatment of choice and will cure the majority of patients. However, often only partial resection is possible due to the location of the tumor. In that case, spontaneous regression, regrowth, or progression to a more aggressive form have been observed. The dependency between the residual tumor size and spontaneous regression is not understood yet. Therefore, the prognosis is largely unpredictable and there is controversy regarding the management of patients for whom complete resection cannot be achieved. Strategies span from pure observation (wait and see) to combinations of surgery, adjuvant chemotherapy, and radiotherapy. Here, we introduce a mathematical model to investigate the growth and progression behavior of PA. In particular, we propose a MARKOV chain model incorporating cell proliferation and death as well as mutations. Our model analysis shows that the tumor behavior after partial resection is essentially determined by a risk coefficient., which can be deduced from epidemiological data about PA. Our results quantitatively predict the regression probability of a partially resected benign PA given the residual tumor size and lead to the hypothesis that this dependency is linear, implying that removing any amount of tumor mass will improve prognosis. This finding stands in contrast to diffuse malignant glioma where an extent of resection threshold has been experimentally shown, below which no benefit for survival is expected.

Autoencoder networks can learn sparse distributed codes similar to those seen in cortical sensory areas such as visual area V1, but they can also be stacked to learn increasingly abstract representations. Several computational neuroscience models of sensory areas, including Olshausen & Field's Sparse Coding algorithm, can be seen as autoencoder variants, and autoencoders have seen extensive use in the machine learning community. Despite their power and versatility, autoencoders have been difficult to implement in a biologically realistic fashion. The challenges include their need to calculate differences between two neuronal activities and their requirement for learning rules which lead to identical changes at feedforward and feedback connections. Here, we study a biologically realistic network of integrate-and-fire neurons with anatomical connectivity and synaptic plasticity that closely matches that observed in cortical sensory areas. Our choice of synaptic plasticity rules is inspired by recent experimental and theoretical results suggesting that learning at feedback connections may have a different form from learning at feedforward connections, and our results depend critically on this novel choice of plasticity rules. Specifically, we propose that plasticity rules at feedforward versus feedback connections are temporally opposed versions of spike-timing dependent plasticity (STDP), leading to a symmetric combined rule we call Mirrored STDP (mSTDP). We show that with mSTDP, our network follows a learning rule that approximately minimizes an autoencoder loss function. When trained with whitened natural image patches, the learned synaptic weights resemble the receptive fields seen in V1. Our results use realistic synaptic plasticity rules to show that the powerful autoencoder learning algorithm could be within the reach of real biological networks.","[Burbank, Kendra S.] Univ Chicago, Dept Stat, Chicago, IL 60637 USA","Burbank, KS (reprint author), Univ Chicago, Dept Stat, Chicago, IL 60637 USA.",burbank@galton.uchicago.edu,,,,,,60,13,13,0,13,PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE,SAN FRANCISCO,"1160 BATTERY STREET, STE 100, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94111 USA",,1553-7358,,PLOS COMPUT BIOL,PLoS Comput.

Our theory leads to simple predictions for the spatial and temporal scales of protein cluster formation, growth and arrest as a function of membrane stiffness, rigidity and kinetics of the adhesive proteins, and the fluid flow in the synaptic cleft. Numerical simulations complement these scaling laws by quantifying the nucleation, growth and stabilization of proteins domains on the size of the cell. Direct comparison with experiment shows that passive elastohydrodynamics and kinetics of protein binding in the synaptic cleft can describe the short-time formation and organization of protein clusters, without evoking any active processes in the cytoskeleton. Despite the apparent complexity of the process, our analysis shows that just two dimensionless parameters characterize the spatial and temporal evolution of the protein pattern: a ratio of membrane elasticity to protein stiffness, and the ratio of a hydrodynamic time scale for fluid flow relative to the protein binding rate.

The underlying pathway is remarkably sensitive in detecting chemical gradients over a wide range of ambient concentrations. Interactions among receptors, which are predominantly clustered at the cell poles, are crucial to this sensitivity. Although it has been suggested that the kinase CheA and the adapter protein CheW are integral for receptor connectivity, the exact coupling mechanism remains unclear. Here, we present a statistical-mechanics approach to model the receptor linkage mechanism itself, building on nanodisc and electron cryotomography experiments. Specifically, we investigate how the sensing behavior of mixed receptor clusters is affected by variations in the expression levels of CheA and CheW at a constant receptor density in the membrane. Our model compares favorably with dose-response curves from in vivo Forster resonance energy transfer (FRET) measurements, demonstrating that the receptor-methylation level has only minor effects on receptor cooperativity. Importantly, our model provides an explanation for the non-intuitive conclusion that the receptor cooperativity decreases with increasing levels of CheA, a core signaling protein associated with the receptors, whereas the receptor cooperativity increases with increasing levels of CheW, a key adapter protein. Finally, we propose an evolutionary advantage as explanation for the recently suggested CheW-only linker structures.","[Eismann, Stephan] Heidelberg Univ, Dept Phys & Astron, Heidelberg, Germany; [Eismann, Stephan; Endres, Robert G.] Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Dept Life Sci, London, England; [Eismann, Stephan; Endres, Robert G.] Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Ctr Integrat Syst Biol & Bioinformat, London, England","Endres, RG (reprint author), Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Dept Life Sci, London, England.",r.endres@imperial.ac.uk,,,German National Academic Foundation; European Research Council [280492-PPHPI]; Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council [BB/I019987/1]; Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council [BB/G000131/1],"This work was initiated while SE was an Erasmus visiting student at Imperial College.

To address this problem, here we are using a generic and simple probabilistic model for the creation and removal of synapses. We show that information can be stored for several months when utilizing the intrinsic dynamics of multi-synapse connections. In such systems, single synapses can still show high turnover, which enables fast learning of new information, but this will not perturb prior stored information (slow forgetting), which is represented by the compound state of the connections.

How such transitions in cortical state impact the information processing performed by cortical circuits is not clear. Here we performed experiments and computational modeling to determine how somatosensory dynamic range depends on cortical state. We used microelectrode arrays to record ongoing and whisker stimulus-evoked population spiking activity in somatosensory cortex of urethane anesthetized rats. We observed a continuum of different cortical states; at one extreme population activity exhibited small scale variability and was weakly correlated, the other extreme had large scale fluctuations and strong correlations. In experiments, shifts along the continuum often occurred naturally, without direct manipulation. In addition, in both the experiment and the model we directly tuned the cortical state by manipulating inhibitory synaptic interactions. Our principal finding was that somatosensory dynamic range was maximized in a specific cortical state, called criticality, near the tipping point midway between the ends of the continuum. The optimal cortical state was uniquely characterized by scale-free ongoing population dynamics and moderate correlations, in line with theoretical predictions about criticality. However, to reproduce our experimental findings, we found that existing theory required modifications which account for activity-dependent depression. In conclusion, our experiments indicate that in vivo sensory dynamic range is maximized near criticality and our model revealed an unanticipated role for activity-dependent depression in this basic principle of cortical function.","[Gautam, Hari; Hoang, Thanh T.; McClanahan, Kylie; Grady, Stephen K.; Shew, Woodrow L.] Univ Arkansas, Dept Phys, Fayetteville, AR 72701 USA","Gautam, H (reprint author), Univ Arkansas, Dept Phys, Fayetteville, AR 72701 USA.",shew@uark.edu,,,"Arkansas Biosciences Institute [0055, 0070]","WLS and SHG were funded in part by the Arkansas Biosciences Institute (Grants 0055 and 0070; http://arbiosciences.org/).

Iron dependent repressor (IdeR) is a metal-sensing transcription factor that regulates free iron concentration in Mycobacterium tuberculosis. IdeR is also known to promote bacterial virulence, making it an important target in the field of therapeutics. Mechanistic details of how iron ions modulate IdeR such that it dimerizes and binds to DNA is not understood clearly. In this study, we have performed molecular dynamic simulations and integrated it with protein structure networks to study the influence of iron on IdeR structure and function. A significant structural variation between the metallated and the non-metal-lated system is observed. Our simulations clearly indicate the importance of iron in stabilizing its monomeric subunit, which in turn promotes dimerization. However, the most striking results are obtained from the simulations of IdeR-DNA complex in the absence of metals, where at the end of 100ns simulations, the protein subunits are seen to rapidly dissociate away from the DNA, thereby forming an excellent resource to investigate the mechanism of DNA binding. We have also investigated the role of iron as an allosteric regulator of IdeR that positively induces IdeR-DNA complex formation.

The dynamic repertoire crucially depends on the network's capacity to store patterns, as well as their stability. Here we systematically explore the capacity of networks derived from human connectomes to store attractor states, as well as various network mechanisms to control the brain's dynamic repertoire. Using a deterministic graded response Hopfield model with connectome-based interactions, we reconstruct the system's attractor space through a uniform sampling of the initial conditions. Large fixed-point attractor sets are obtained in the low temperature condition, with a bigger number of attractors than ever reported so far. Different variants of the initial model, including (i) a uniform activation threshold or (ii) a global negative feedback, produce a similarly robust multistability in a limited parameter range. A numerical analysis of the distribution of the attractors identifies spatially-segregated components, with a centro-medial core and several well-delineated regional patches. Those different modes share similarity with the fMRI independent components observed in the ""resting state"" condition. We demonstrate non-stationary behavior in noise-driven generalizations of the models, with different meta-stable attractors visited along the same time course. Only the model with a global dynamic density control is found to display robust and long-lasting non-stationarity with no tendency toward either overactivity or extinction. The best fit with empirical signals is observed at the edge of multistability, a parameter region that also corresponds to the highest entropy of the attractors.","[Golos, Mathieu; Jirsa, Viktor; Dauce, Emmanuel] Aix Marseille Univ, INSERM, INS UMR S 1106, Marseille, France; [Dauce, Emmanuel] Ecole Cent Marseille, Marseille, France","Golos, M (reprint author), Aix Marseille Univ, INSERM, INS UMR S 1106, Marseille, France.",emmanuel.dauce@univ-amu.fr,"Dauce, Emmanuel/O-6533-2016; Jirsa, Viktor/M-4630-2016","Dauce, Emmanuel/0000-0001-6596-8168; Jirsa, Viktor/0000-0002-8251-8860; Golos, Mathieu/0000-0002-9932-1466",Brain Network Recovery Group - James S McDonnel Foundation [220020255]; A*Midex grant Coord-Age; European Union [60402],"The research reported here was supported by Brain Network Recovery Group funded by the James S McDonnel Foundation; Award Number: 220020255 to VJ; A*Midex grant Coord-Age, to VJ; and European Union Seventh Framework Programme (Human Brain Project); Award Number: 60402 to VJ.

At the same time, the coalescent-based models of the pathogen population that are employed in the methods usually used for time-resolved phylogeny reconstruction are a considerable simplification of epidemic process, as they assume that pathogen lineages mix freely. Here, we contribute a new method that is simultaneously a phylogeny reconstruction method for isolates taken from an epidemic, and a procedure for transmission tree reconstruction. We observe that, if one or more samples is taken from each host in an epidemic or outbreak and these are used to build a phylogeny, a transmission tree is equivalent to a partition of the set of nodes of this phylogeny, such that each partition element is a set of nodes that is connected in the full tree and contains all the tips corresponding to samples taken from one and only one host. We then implement a Monte Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) procedure for simultaneous sampling from the spaces of both trees, utilising a newly-designed set of phylogenetic tree proposals that also respect node partitions. We calculate the posterior probability of these partitioned trees based on a model that acknowledges the population structure of an epidemic by employing an individual-based disease transmission model and a coalescent process taking place within each host. We demonstrate our method, first using simulated data, and then with sequences taken from the H7N7 avian influenza outbreak that occurred in the Netherlands in 2003. We show that it is superior to established coalescent methods for reconstructing the topology and node heights of the phylogeny and performs well for transmission tree reconstruction when the phylogeny is well-resolved by the genetic data, but caution that this will often not be the case in practice and that existing genetic and epidemiological data should be used to configure such analyses whenever possible.

This background ""noise"" seems to be the dominant cause of the notoriously high trial-to-trial variability of neural recordings. Recent experimental observations have extended our knowledge of trial-to-trial variability and spontaneous activity in several directions: 1. Trial-to-trial variability systematically decreases following the onset of a sensory stimulus or the start of a motor act. 2. Spontaneous activity states in sensory cortex outline the region of evoked sensory responses. 3. Across development, spontaneous activity aligns itself with typical evoked activity patterns. 4. The spontaneous brain activity prior to the presentation of an ambiguous stimulus predicts how the stimulus will be interpreted. At present it is unclear how these observations relate to each other and how they arise in cortical circuits. Here we demonstrate that all of these phenomena can be accounted for by a deterministic self-organizing recurrent neural network model (SORN), which learns a predictive model of its sensory environment. The SORN comprises recurrently coupled populations of excitatory and inhibitory threshold units and learns via a combination of spike-timing dependent plasticity (STDP) and homeostatic plasticity mechanisms. Similar to balanced network architectures, units in the network show irregular activity and variable responses to inputs. Additionally, however, the SORN exhibits sequence learning abilities matching recent findings from visual cortex and the network's spontaneous activity reproduces the experimental findings mentioned above. Intriguingly, the network's behaviour is reminiscent of sampling-based probabilistic inference, suggesting that correlates of sampling-based inference can develop from the interaction of STDP and homeostasis in deterministic networks. We conclude that key observations on spontaneous brain activity and the variability of neural responses can be accounted for by a simple deterministic recurrent neural network which learns a predictive model of its sensory environment via a combination of generic neural plasticity mechanisms.","[Hartmann, Christoph; Lazar, Andreea; Nessler, Bernhard; Triesch, Jochen] Goethe Univ Frankfurt, Frankfurt Inst Adv Studies, D-60054 Frankfurt, Germany; [Hartmann, Christoph] Max Planck Inst Brain Res, Int Max Planck Res Sch Neural Circuits, Frankfurt, Germany; [Lazar, Andreea] Max Planck Gesell, Ernt Strungmann Inst ESI Neurosci Cooperat, Frankfurt, Germany","Hartmann, C (reprint author), Goethe Univ Frankfurt, Frankfurt Inst Adv Studies, D-60054 Frankfurt, Germany.",chartmann@fias.uni-frankfurt.de,,,LOEWE-Program Neural Coordination Research Focus Frankfurt (NeFF); Quandt foundation; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG),"CH and JT received funding by the LOEWE-Program Neural Coordination Research Focus Frankfurt (NeFF).

Virus released from activated latent cells competes against variants that have continually evolved and adapted to host immune pressure. Nevertheless, there is increasing evidence that virus displaying a signal of latency survives in patient plasma despite having reduced fitness due to long-term immune memory. We investigated the survival of virus with latent envelope genomic fragments by simulating within-host HIV-1 sequence evolution and the cycling of viral lineages in and out of the latent reservoir. Our model incorporates a detailed mutation process including nucleotide substitution, recombination, latent reservoir dynamics, diversifying selection pressure driven by the immune response, and purifying selection pressure asserted by deleterious mutations. We evaluated the ability of our model to capture sequence evolution in vivo by comparing our simulated sequences to HIV-1 envelope sequence data from 16 HIV-infected untreated patients. Empirical sequence divergence and diversity measures were qualitatively and quantitatively similar to those of our simulated HIV-1 populations, suggesting that our model invokes realistic trends of HIV-1 genetic evolution. Moreover, reconstructed phylogenies of simulated and patient HIV-1 populations showed similar topological structures. Our simulation results suggest that recombination is a key mechanism facilitating the persistence of virus with latent envelope genomic fragments in the productively infected cell population. Recombination increased the survival probability of latent virus forms approximately 13-fold. Prevalence of virus with latent fragments in productively infected cells was observed in only 2% of simulations when we ignored recombination, while the proportion increased to 27% of simulations when we allowed recombination. We also found that the selection pressures exerted by different fitness landscapes influenced the shape of phylogenies, diversity trends, and survival of virus with latent genomic fragments. Our model predicts that the persistence of latent genomic fragments from multiple different ancestral origins increases sequence diversity in plasma for reasonable fitness landscapes.","[Immonen, Taina T.; Romero-Severson, Ethan O.; Perelson, Alan S.; Leitner, Thomas] Los Alamos Natl Lab, Theoret Biol & Biophys, Los Alamos, NM USA; [Conway, Jessica M.] Penn State Univ, Dept Math, University Pk, PA 16802 USA","Immonen, TT (reprint author), Los Alamos Natl Lab, Theoret Biol & Biophys, Los Alamos, NM USA.",tti@lanl.gov,,,"National Institutes of Health [R01-AI028433, R01-OD011095, AI106437]","This research was funded by the National Institutes of Health grants R01-AI028433 and R01-OD011095 (awarded to ASP), and the National Institutes of Health grant AI106437 (awarded to TL).

ParB proteins move by interacting with DNA bound ParA-ATP, stimulating their unbinding by catalyzing hydrolysis, that leads to rectified motion due to the creation of a wake of depleted ParA. Recent in vitro experiments have shown that a ParB covered magnetic bead can move with constant speed over a DNA covered substrate that is bound by ParA. It has been suggested that the formation of a gradient in ParA leads to diffusion-ratchet like motion of the ParB bead but how it forms and generates a force is still a matter of exploration. Here we develop a deterministic model for the in vitro ParA-ParB system and show that a ParA gradient can spontaneously form due to any amount of initial spatial noise in bound ParA. The speed of the bead is independent of this noise but depends on the ratio of the range of ParA-ParB force on the bead to that of removal of surface bound ParA by ParB. We find that at a particular ratio the speed attains a maximal value. We also consider ParA rebinding (including cooperativity) and ParA surface diffusion independently as mechanisms for ParA recovery on the surface. Depending on whether the DNA covered surface is undersaturated or saturated with ParA, we find that the bead can accelerate persistently or potentially stall. Our model highlights key requirements of the ParA-ParB driving force that are necessary for directed motion in the in vitro system that may provide insight into the in vivo dynamics of the ParA-ParB system.","[Jindal, Lavisha; Emberly, Eldon] Simon Fraser Univ, Dept Phys, Burnaby, BC V5A 1S6, Canada","Emberly, E (reprint author), Simon Fraser Univ, Dept Phys, Burnaby, BC V5A 1S6, Canada.",eemberly@sfu.ca,,,Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada,"EE received funding from The Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada.

We constructed the system using confocal immunofluorescence microscopy images from the Human Protein Atlas project for 11 punctate proteins in three cultured cell lines. These proteins have previously been characterized as being primarily located in punctate structures, but their images had all been annotated by visual examination as being simply ""vesicular"". We were able to show that these patterns could be distinguished from each other with high accuracy, and we were able to assign to one of these subclasses hundreds of proteins whose subcellular localization had not previously been well defined. In addition to providing these novel annotations, we built a generative approach to modeling of punctate distributions that captures the essential characteristics of the distinct patterns. Such models are expected to be valuable for representing and summarizing each pattern and for constructing systems biology simulations of cell behaviors.","[Johnson, Gregory R.; Shariff, Aabid; Rohde, Gustavo K.; Murphy, Robert F.] Carnegie Mellon Univ, Computat Biol Dept, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA; [Johnson, Gregory R.; Li, Jieyue; Shariff, Aabid; Rohde, Gustavo K.; Murphy, Robert F.] Carnegie Mellon Univ, Ctr Bioimage Informat, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA; [Li, Jieyue; Rohde, Gustavo K.; Murphy, Robert F.] Carnegie Mellon Univ, Dept Biomed Engn, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA; [Rohde, Gustavo K.] Carnegie Mellon Univ, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA; [Murphy, Robert F.] Carnegie Mellon Univ, Dept Biol Sci, 4400 5th Ave, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA; [Murphy, Robert F.] Carnegie Mellon Univ, Dept Machine Learning, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA; [Murphy, Robert F.] Univ Freiburg, Fac Biol, Hugstetter Str 55, D-79106 Freiburg, Germany; [Murphy, Robert F.] Univ Freiburg, Freiburg Inst Adv Studies, Hugstetter Str 55, D-79106 Freiburg, Germany","Johnson, GR (reprint author), Carnegie Mellon Univ, Computat Biol Dept, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA.",murphy@cmu.edu,,"Rohde, Gustavo/0000-0003-1703-9035","National Institutes of Health [GM075205, GM090033, GM103712, EB009403]","This work was supported in part by National Institutes of Health grants GM075205, GM090033, GM103712 and EB009403.

Mapping millions of DNA reads from such samples to reference protein databases requires long run-times, and short read lengths can result in spurious hits to unrelated proteins (loss of specificity). We developed ShortBRED (Short, Better Representative Extract Dataset) to address these challenges, facilitating fast, accurate functional profiling of metagenomic samples. ShortBRED consists of two components: (i) a method that reduces reference proteins of interest to short, highly representative amino acid sequences (""markers"") and (ii) a search step that maps reads to these markers to quantify the relative abundance of their associated proteins. After evaluating ShortBRED on synthetic data, we applied it to profile antibiotic resistance protein families in the gut microbiomes of individuals from the United States, China, Malawi, and Venezuela. Our results support antibiotic resistance as a core function in the human gut microbiome, with tetracy-cline-resistant ribosomal protection proteins and Class A beta-lactamases being the most widely distributed resistance mechanisms worldwide. ShortBRED markers are applicable to other homology-based search tasks, which we demonstrate here by identifying phylogenetic signatures of antibiotic resistance across more than 3,000 microbial isolate genomes.

However, the siRNA guide strand may bind unintended off-target transcripts via partial sequence complementarity by a mechanism closely mirroring micro RNA (miRNA) silencing. To better understand these off-target effects, we investigated the correlation between sequence features within various subsections of siRNA guide strands, and its corresponding target sequences, with off-target activities. Our results confirm previous reports that strength of base-pairing in the siRNA seed region is the primary factor determining the efficiency of off-target silencing. However, the degree of downregulation of off-target transcripts with shared seed sequence is not necessarily similar, suggesting that there are additional auxiliary factors that influence the silencing potential. Here, we demonstrate that both the melting temperature (Tm) in a subsection of siRNA non-seed region, and the GC contents of its corresponding target sequences, are negatively correlated with the efficiency of off-target effect. Analysis of experimentally validated miRNA targets demonstrated a similar trend, indicating a putative conserved mechanistic feature of seed region-dependent targeting mechanism. These observations may prove useful as parameters for off-target prediction algorithms and improve siRNA 'specificity' design rules.","[Kamola, Piotr J.] Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Dept Surg & Canc, London, England; [Kamola, Piotr J.] GlaxoSmithKline R&D, Safety Assessment, Ware, Herts, England; [Kamola, Piotr J.; Wilson, Paul A.] GlaxoSmithKline R&D, Computat Biol, Stevenage, Herts, England; [Kamola, Piotr J.] Publ Hlth England, Ctr Radiat Chem & Environm Hazards, London, England; [Nakano, Yuko; Takahashi, Tomoko; Uitei, Kumiko] Univ Tokyo, Dept Biol Sci, Bunkyo Ku, Tokyo, Japan; [Uitei, Kumiko] Univ Tokyo, Dept Computat Biol & Med Sci, Kashiwa, Chiba, Japan","Uitei, K (reprint author), Univ Tokyo, Dept Biol Sci, Bunkyo Ku, Tokyo, Japan.",ktei@bs.s.u-tokyo.ac.jp,,,"EPSRC CASE Award [EP/J502017/1]; EPSRC CASE Award (GlaxoSmithKline); EPSRC CASE Award (Imperial College London); EPSRC CASE Award (Public Health England); Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology of Japan, Cell Innovation Program (MEXT) grant","This work was supported by an EPSRC CASE Award (EP/J502017/1, GlaxoSmithKline, Imperial College London and Public Health England) to PJK and Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology of Japan, Cell Innovation Program (MEXT) grant to KUT.

The size and shape of a developing tissue is a function of the number and size of its constituent cells as well as their geometric packing. How these cellular properties are coordinated at the tissue level to ensure developmental robustness remains a mystery; understanding this process requires studying multiple concurrent processes that make up morphogenesis, including the spatial patterning of cell fates and apoptosis, as well as cell intercalations. In this work, we develop a computational model that aims to understand aspects of the robust pattern repair mechanisms of the Drosophila embryonic epidermal tissues. Size control in this system has previously been shown to rely on the regulation of apoptosis rather than proliferation; however, to date little work has been done to understand the role of cellular mechanics in this process. We employ a vertex model of an embryonic segment to test hypotheses about the emergence of this size control. Comparing the model to previously published data across wild type and genetic perturbations, we show that passive mechanical forces suffice to explain the observed size control in the posterior (P) compartment of a segment. However, observed asymmetries in cell death frequencies across the segment are demonstrated to require patterning of cellular properties in the model. Finally, we show that distinct forms of mechanical regulation in the model may be distinguished by differences in cell shapes in the P compartment, as quantified through experimentally accessible summary statistics, as well as by the tissue recoil after laser ablation experiments.","[Kursawe, Jochen; Baker, Ruth E.; Fletcher, Alexander G.] Univ Oxford, Math Inst, Oxford, England; [Brodskiy, Pavel A.; Zartman, Jeremiah J.] Univ Notre Dame, Dept Chem & Biomol Engn, Notre Dame, IN 46556 USA; [Fletcher, Alexander G.] Univ Sheffield, Sch Math & Stat, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, England","Zartman, JJ (reprint author), Univ Notre Dame, Dept Chem & Biomol Engn, Notre Dame, IN 46556 USA.",jzartman@nd.edu; a.g.fletcher@sheffield.ac.uk,"Fletcher, Alexander/C-8908-2013","Fletcher, Alexander/0000-0003-0525-4336; Brodskiy, Pavel/0000-0002-1951-7734",Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council; NIH [UO1 HL116330]; National Science Foundation [CBET 1403887]; Royal Society International Exchanges Scheme grant [IE130149]; Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council [EP/I017909/1]; Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council [1207717],"JK acknowledges funding from the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council through a studentship.

Here, we present a new method for accurately predicting protein-protein interfaces, understanding their properties, origins and binding to multiple partners. Contrary to machine learning approaches, our method combines in a rational and very straightforward way three sequence-and structure-based descriptors of protein residues: evolutionary conservation, physico-chemical properties and local geometry. The implemented strategy yields very precise predictions for a wide range of protein-protein interfaces and discriminates them from small-molecule binding sites. Beyond its predictive power, the approach permits to dissect interaction surfaces and unravel their complexity. We show how the analysis of the predicted patches can foster new strategies for PPIs modulation and interaction surface redesign. The approach is implemented in JET2, an automated tool based on the Joint Evolutionary Trees (JET) method for sequence-based protein interface prediction.

During their long evolutionary history they maintained a unique body plan with two pairs of large wing-like flippers, but their locomotion has been a topic of debate for almost 200 years. Key areas of controversy have concerned the most efficient biologically possible limb stroke, e.g. whether it consisted of rowing, underwater flight, or modified underwater flight, and how the four limbs moved in relation to each other: did they move in or out of phase? Previous studies have investigated plesiosaur swimming using a variety of methods, including skeletal analysis, human swimmers, and robotics. We adopt a novel approach using a digital, three-dimensional, articulated, free-swimming plesiosaur in a simulated fluid. We generated a large number of simulations under various joint degrees of freedom to investigate how the locomotory repertoire changes under different parameters. Within the biologically possible range of limb motion, the simulated plesiosaur swims primarily with its forelimbs using an unmodified underwater flight stroke, essentially the same as turtles and penguins. In contrast, the hindlimbs provide relatively weak thrust in all simulations. We conclude that plesiosaurs were forelimb-dominated swimmers that used their hind limbs mainly for maneuverability and stability.","[Liu, Shiqiu; Gu, Yuting; Tan, Jie; Liu, C.

However, recent reports of ramp-like increases in dopamine concentration in the striatum when animals are about to act, or are about to reach rewards, appear to pose a challenge to established thinking. This is because the implied activity is persistently predictable by preceding stimuli, and so cannot arise as this sort of prediction error. Here, we explore three possible accounts of such ramping signals: (a) the resolution of uncertainty about the timing of action; (b) the direct influence of dopamine over mechanisms associated with making choices; and (c) a new model of discounted vigour. Collectively, these suggest that dopamine ramps may be explained, with only minor disturbance, by standard theoretical ideas, though urgent questions remain regarding their proximal cause. We suggest experimental approaches to disentangling which of the proposed mechanisms are responsible for dopamine ramps.","[Lloyd, Kevin; Dayan, Peter] Gatsby Computat Neurosci Unit, London, England","Lloyd, K (reprint author), Gatsby Computat Neurosci Unit, London, England.",klloyd@gatsby.ucl.ac.uk,,,Gatsby Charitable Foundation,"This work was supported by the Gatsby Charitable Foundation (KL and PD).

However, neurophysiological studies in vivo often rather measure the mass activity of neuronal microcircuits with the local field potential (LFP). Given that LFPs are generated by spatially separated currents across the neuronal membrane, they cannot be computed directly from quantities defined in models of point-like LIF neurons. Here, we explore the best approximation for predicting the LFP based on standard output from point-neuron LIF networks. To search for this best ""LFP proxy"", we compared LFP predictions from candidate proxies based on LIF network output (e.g, firing rates, membrane potentials, synaptic currents) with ""ground-truth"" LFP obtained when the LIF network synaptic input currents were injected into an analogous three-dimensional (3D) network model of multi-compartmental neurons with realistic morphology, spatial distributions of somata and synapses. We found that a specific fixed linear combination of the LIF synaptic currents provided an accurate LFP proxy, accounting for most of the variance of the LFP time course observed in the 3D network for all recording locations. This proxy performed well over a broad set of conditions, including substantial variations of the neuronal morphologies. Our results provide a simple formula for estimating the time course of the LFP from LIF network simulations in cases where a single pyramidal population dominates the LFP generation, and thereby facilitate quantitative comparison between computational models and experimental LFP recordings in vivo.","[Mazzoni, Alberto] Scuola Super Sant Anna, Biorobot Inst, Pisa, Italy; [Mazzoni, Alberto; Panzeri, Stefano] Ist Italiano Tecnol, Ctr Neurosci & Cognit Syst UniTn, Neural Computat Lab, Rovereto, Italy; [Linden, Henrik] Univ Copenhagen, Dept Neurosci & Pharmacol, Copenhagen, Denmark; [Linden, Henrik; Lansner, Anders] Royal Inst Technol KTH, Sch Comp Sci & Commun, Dept Computat Biol, Stockholm, Sweden; [Cuntz, Hermann] Max Planck Gesell, Ernst Strungmann Inst ESI Neurosci, Frankfurt, Germany; [Cuntz, Hermann] Goethe Univ Frankfurt, Inst Clin Neuroanat, Frankfurt, Germany; [Cuntz, Hermann] FIAS, Frankfurt, Germany; [Einevoll, Gaute T.] Norwegian Univ Life Sci, Dept Math Sci & Technol, As, Norway; [Einevoll, Gaute T.] Univ Oslo, Dept Phys, Oslo, Norway","Mazzoni, A (reprint author), Scuola Super Sant Anna, Biorobot Inst, Pisa, Italy.",a.mazzoni@sssup.it; gaute.einevoll@nmbu.no,"Mazzoni, Alberto/N-6960-2016; Cuntz, Hermann/O-2181-2019; Mazzoni, Alberto/A-5433-2018; Cuntz, Hermann/E-7057-2012; Panzeri, Stefano/L-5977-2013; Lansner, Anders/E-4824-2016","Mazzoni, Alberto/0000-0002-9632-1831; Cuntz, Hermann/0000-0001-5445-0507; Mazzoni, Alberto/0000-0002-9632-1831; Cuntz, Hermann/0000-0001-5445-0507; Panzeri, Stefano/0000-0003-1700-8909; Linden, Henrik/0000-0001-5630-4095; Lansner, Anders/0000-0002-2358-7815","NEBIAS European project [EUFP7-ICT-611687]; PRIN/HandBot Italian project [CUP: B81J12002680008, prot.: 20102YF2RY]; European Commission [FP7-284553]; Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation; Directorate General for Country Promotion (Economy, Culture and Science)-Unit for Scientific and Technological Cooperation, via the Italy-Sweden bilateral research project on ""Brain network mechanisms for integration of natural tactile input patterns""; Danish Council for Independent Research; FP7 Marie Curie Actions - COFUND [DFF - 1330-00226]; EU [269921, 604102]; Dynamical Systems Interdisciplinary Network, University of Copenhagen; BMBF [01GQ1406]; Autonomous Province of Trento; Research Council of Norway (ISP-Physics)","AM was supported by the NEBIAS European project (EUFP7-ICT-611687), by the PRIN/HandBot Italian project (CUP: B81J12002680008; prot.: 20102YF2RY), by the SI-CODE Project of the FP7 of the European Commission (FET-Open, Grant FP7-284553) and by the Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation, Directorate General for Country Promotion (Economy, Culture and Science)-Unit for Scientific and Technological Cooperation, via the Italy-Sweden bilateral research project on ""Brain network mechanisms for integration of natural tactile input patterns"".

Therefore, farmers in a region are often influenced by similar circumstances, and this can create a coordinated response for pest control that is effective at a landscape scale. This coordinated response is not intentional, but is an emergent property of the system. We propose a framework for understanding the intrinsic feedback mechanisms between the actions of humans and the dynamics of pest populations and demonstrate this framework using the European corn borer, a serious pest in maize crops. We link a model of the European corn borer and a parasite in a landscape with a model that simulates the decisions of individual farmers on what type of maize to grow. Farmers chose whether to grow Bt-maize, which is toxic to the corn borer, or conventional maize for which the seed is cheaper. The problem is akin to the snow-drift problem in game theory; that is to say, if enough farmers choose to grow Bt maize then because the pest is suppressed an individual may benefit from growing conventional maize. We show that the communication network between farmers' and their perceptions of profit and loss affects landscape scale patterns in pest dynamics. We found that although adoption of Bt maize often brings increased financial returns, these rewards oscillate in response to the prevalence of pests.","[Milne, Alice E.; van den Bosch, Frank; Parnell, Stephen] Rothamsted Res, Computat & Syst Biol, Harpenden, Herts, England; [Bell, James R.] Rothamsted Res, Rothamsted Insect Survey, Harpenden, Herts, England; [Hutchison, William D.] Univ Minnesota, Dept Entomol, St Paul, MN 55108 USA; [Mitchell, Paul D.] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Agr & Appl Econ, Madison, WI USA; [Crowder, David] Washington State Univ, Dept Entomol, Pullman, WA 99164 USA; [Parnell, Stephen] Univ Salford, Sch Environm & Life Sci, Manchester, Lancs, England; [Whitmore, Andrew P.] Rothamsted Res, Sustainable Soils & Grassland Syst, Harpenden, Herts, England","Milne, AE (reprint author), Rothamsted Res, Computat & Syst Biol, Harpenden, Herts, England.",alice.milne@rothamsted.ac.uk,"Bell, James/C-2247-2009; parnell, stephen/I-7682-2015","Bell, James/0000-0003-1640-6120; Whitmore, Andrew/0000-0001-8984-1436; Milne, Alice/0000-0002-4509-0578; parnell, stephen/0000-0002-2625-4557",Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC) [S5198]; Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council [BBS/E/C/00005195],"This research was funded by the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC) grant number S5198.

We focus here on the effects of an important building block of heterogeneous environments, isolated obstacles. With a combination of experiments, theory, and simulation, we show how isolated obstacles both create long-lived distortions of the front shape and amplify the effect of genetic drift. A system of bacteriophage T7 spreading on a spatially heterogeneous Escherichia coli lawn serves as an experimental model system to study population expansions. Using an inkjet printer, we create well-defined replicates of the lawn and quantitatively study the population expansion of phage T7. The transient perturbations of the population front found in the experiments are well described by a model in which the front moves with constant speed. Independent of the precise details of the expansion, we show that obstacles create a kink in the front that persists over large distances and is insensitive to the details of the obstacle's shape. The small deviations between experimental findings and the predictions of the constant speed model can be understood with a more general reaction-diffusion model, which reduces to the constant speed model when the obstacle size is large compared to the front width. Using this framework, we demonstrate that frontier genotypes just grazing the side of an isolated obstacle increase in abundance, a phenomenon we call 'geometry-enhanced genetic drift', complementary to the founder effect associated with spatial bottlenecks.

A number of post-transcriptional regulators, termed microRNAs, are closely connected with the p53-mediated cellular networks. While the molecular interactions among p53 and microRNAs have emerged, a systems-level understanding of the regulatory mechanism and the role of microRNAs-forming feedback loops with the p53 core remains elusive. Here we have identified from literature that there exist three classes of microRNA-mediated feedback loops revolving around p53, all with the nature of positive feedback coincidentally. To explore the relationship between the cellular performance of p53 with the microRNA feedback pathways, we developed a mathematical model of the core p53-MDM2 module coupled with three microRNA-mediated positive feedback loops involving miR-192, miR-34a, and miR-29a. Simulations and bifurcation analysis in relationship to extrinsic noise reproduce the oscillatory behavior of p53 under DNA damage in single cells, and notably show that specific microRNA abrogation can disrupt the wild-type cellular phenotype when the ubiquitous cell-to-cell variability is taken into account. To assess these in silico results we conducted microRNA-perturbation experiments in MCF7 breast cancer cells. Time-lapse microscopy of cell-population behavior in response to DNA double-strand breaks, together with image classification of single-cell phenotypes across a population, confirmed that the cellular p53 oscillations are compromised after miR-192 perturbations, matching well with the model predictions. Our study via modeling in combination with quantitative experiments provides new evidence on the role of microRNA-mediated positive feedback loops in conferring robustness to the system performance of stress-induced response of p53.","[Moore, Richard; Ooi, Hsu Kiang; Kang, Taek; Bleris, Leonidas; Ma, Lan] Univ Texas Dallas, Bioengn Dept, Richardson, TX 75083 USA; [Moore, Richard; Kang, Taek; Bleris, Leonidas] Univ Texas Dallas, Ctr Syst Biol, Richardson, TX 75083 USA; [Bleris, Leonidas] Univ Texas Dallas, Dept Elect Engn, Richardson, TX 75083 USA","Bleris, L (reprint author), Univ Texas Dallas, Bioengn Dept, Richardson, TX 75083 USA.",bleris@utdallas.edu; lan.ma@utdallas.edu,,,National Cancer Institute [1R21CA170018-01]; National Science Foundaiton [DMS1361355],"This work was funded by: National Cancer Institute, 1R21CA170018-01, http://www.cancer.gov/; and National Science Foundaiton, DMS1361355, http://www.nsf.gov.

Chronic inflammation is often characterized by a persistent increase in the concentrations of inflammatory cells and molecular mediators, whose distinct amount and timing characteristics offer an opportunity to identify effective therapeutic regulatory targets. Here, we used our recently developed computational model of local inflammation to identify potential targets for molecular interventions and to investigate the effects of individual and combined inhibition of such targets. This was accomplished via the development and application of computational strategies involving the simulation and analysis of thousands of inflammatory scenarios. We found that modulation of macrophage influx and efflux is an effective potential strategy to regulate the amount of inflammatory cells and molecular mediators in both normal and chronic inflammatory scenarios. We identified three molecular mediators - tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta), and the chemokine CXCL8 - as potential molecular targets whose individual or combined inhibition may robustly regulate both the amount and timing properties of the kinetic trajectories for neutrophils and macrophages in chronic inflammation.

Therefore, it seems reasonable to assume that spatial localizations should generally be accurate. Curiously, some previous studies have reported biases in visual and auditory localizations, but these studies have used small sample sizes and the results have been mixed. Therefore, it is not clear (1) if the reported biases in localization responses are real (or due to outliers, sampling bias, or other factors), and (2) whether these putative biases reflect a bias in sensory representations of space or a priori expectations (which may be due to the experimental setup, instructions, or distribution of stimuli). Here, to address these questions, a dataset of unprecedented size (obtained from 384 observers) was analyzed to examine presence, direction, and magnitude of sensory biases, and quantitative computational modeling was used to probe the underlying mechanism(s) driving these effects. Data revealed that, on average, observers were biased towards the center when localizing visual stimuli, and biased towards the periphery when localizing auditory stimuli. Moreover, quantitative analysis using a Bayesian Causal Inference framework suggests that while pre-existing spatial biases for central locations exert some influence, biases in the sensory representations of both visual and auditory space are necessary to fully explain the behavioral data. How are these opposing visual and auditory biases reconciled in conditions in which both auditory and visual stimuli are produced by a single event? Potentially, the bias in one modality could dominate, or the biases could interact/cancel out. The data revealed that when integration occurred in these conditions, the visual bias dominated, but the magnitude of this bias was reduced compared to unisensory conditions. Therefore, multisensory integration not only improves the precision of perceptual estimates, but also the accuracy.","[Odegaard, Brian; Wozny, David R.; Shams, Ladan] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Psychol, Los Angeles, CA USA; [Shams, Ladan] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept BioEngn, Los Angeles, CA USA; [Shams, Ladan] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Neurosci Interdepartmental Program, Los Angeles, CA USA","Odegaard, B (reprint author), Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Psychol, Los Angeles, CA USA.",odegaard.brian@gmail.com,,,National Science Foundation [1057969],"LS was supported by a grant from National Science Foundation 1057969.

In the ascidian embryo, four signaling ligands, Ephrin-A. d (Efna.d), Fgf9/16/20, Admp, and Gdf1/3-r, coordinately induce Otx expression in the neural lineage at the 32-cell stage. However, it has not been determined whether differential inputs of all of these signaling pathways are really necessary. It is possible that differential activation of one of these signaling pathways is sufficient and the remaining signaling pathways are activated in all cells at similar levels. To address this question, we developed a parameter-free method for determining a Boolean function for Otx expression in the present study. We treated activities of signaling pathways as Boolean values, and we also took all possible patterns of signaling gradients into consideration. We successfully determined a Boolean function that explains Otx expression in the animal hemisphere of wild-type and morphant embryos at the 32-cell stage. This Boolean function was not inconsistent with three sensing patterns, which represented whether or not individual cells received sufficient amounts of the signaling molecules. These sensing patterns all indicated that differential expression of Otx in the neural lineage is primarily determined by Efna. d, but not by differential inputs of Fgf9/16/20, Admp, and Gdf1/3-r signaling. To confirm this hypothesis experimentally, we simultaneously knocked-down Admp, Gdf1/3-r, and Fgf9/16/20, and treated this triple morphant with recombinant bFGF and BMP4 proteins, which mimic Fgf9/16/20 and Admp/Gdf1/3-r activity, respectively. Although no differential inputs of Admp, Gdf1/3-r and Fgf9/16/20 signaling were expected under this experimental condition, Otx was expressed specifically in the neural lineage. Thus, direct cell-cell interactions through Efna. d play a critical role in patterning the ectoderm of the early ascidian embryo.","[Ohta, Naoyuki; Waki, Kana; Satou, Yutaka] Kyoto Univ, Grad Sch Sci, Dept Zool, Kyoto, Japan; [Mochizuki, Atsushi] RIKEN, Adv Sci Inst, Wako, Saitama, Japan; [Mochizuki, Atsushi; Satou, Yutaka] Japan Sci & Technol Agcy, CREST, Kawaguchi, Saitama, Japan","Ohta, N (reprint author), Kyoto Univ, Grad Sch Sci, Dept Zool, Kyoto, Japan.",yutaka@ascidian.zool.kyoto-u.ac.jp,"Mochizuki, Atsushi/A-7917-2015; Satou, Yutaka/K-7131-2012","Mochizuki, Atsushi/0000-0002-7714-1755; Satou, Yutaka/0000-0001-5193-0708",JSPS; JST,"JSPS: http://www.jsps.go.jp/english/index.html JST: http://www.jst.go.jp/EN/index.html The funders had no role in study design, data collection and analysis, decision to publish, or preparation of the manuscript.",,22,5,5,0,3,PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE,SAN FRANCISCO,"1160 BATTERY STREET, STE 100, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94111 USA",1553-734X,1553-7358,,PLOS COMPUT BIOL,PLoS Comput.

The stimulus-secretion pathway in L-cells is still poorly understood, although it is known that GLP-1 secreting cells use sodium-glucose co-transporters (SGLT) and ATP-sensitive K+-channels (K(ATP)-channels) to sense intestinal glucose levels. Electrical activity then transduces glucose sensing to Ca2+-stimulated exocytosis. This particular glucose-sensing arrangement with glucose triggering both a depolarizing SGLT current as well as leading to closure of the hyperpolarizing K(ATP) current is of more general interest for our understanding of glucose-sensing cells. To dissect the interactions of these two glucose-sensing mechanisms, we build a mathematical model of electrical activity underlying GLP-1 secretion. Two sets of model parameters are presented: one set represents primary mouse colonic L-cells; the other set is based on data from the GLP-1 secreting GLUTag cell line. The model is then used to obtain insight into the differences in glucose-sensing between primary L-cells and GLUTag cells. Our results illuminate how the two glucose-sensing mechanisms interact, and suggest that the depolarizing effect of SGLT currents is modulated by K (ATP)-channel activity. Based on our simulations, we propose that primary L-cells encode the glucose signal as changes in action potential amplitude, whereas GLUTag cells rely mainly on frequency modulation. The model should be useful for further basic, pharmacological and theoretical investigations of the cellular signals underlying endogenous GLP-1 and peptide YY release.","[Riz, Michela; Pedersen, Morten Gram] Univ Padua, Dept Informat Engn, Padua, Italy","Pedersen, MG (reprint author), Univ Padua, Dept Informat Engn, Padua, Italy.",pedersen@dei.unipd.it,"Pedersen, Morten Gram/P-5247-2019; Pedersen, Morten/F-4134-2012","Pedersen, Morten Gram/0000-0002-2639-2394; Pedersen, Morten/0000-0002-2639-2394",,,,51,5,5,0,5,PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE,SAN FRANCISCO,"1160 BATTERY STREET, STE 100, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94111 USA",1553-734X,1553-7358,,PLOS COMPUT BIOL,PLoS Comput.

Capitalizing on these developments, various public efforts such as The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) generate disparate omic data for large patient cohorts. As demonstrated by recent studies, these heterogeneous data sources provide the opportunity to gain insights into the molecular changes that drive cancer pathogenesis and progression. However, these insights are limited by the vast search space and as a result low statistical power to make new discoveries. In this paper, we propose methods for integrating disparate omic data using molecular interaction networks, with a view to gaining mechanistic insights into the relationship between molecular changes at different levels of cellular activity. Namely, we hypothesize that genes that play a role in cancer development and progression may be implicated by neither frequent mutation nor differential expression, and that network-based integration of mutation and differential expression data can reveal these ""silent players"". For this purpose, we utilize network-propagation algorithms to simulate the information flow in the cell at a sample-specific resolution. We then use the propagated mutation and expression signals to identify genes that are not necessarily mutated or differentially expressed genes, but have an essential role in tumor development and patient outcome.

However, factors regulating this motion, and the implications of this motion if perturbed, remain incompletely understood. In the current study, we address these questions using a cell-center based model in which cells are polarized, motile, and interact with the neighboring cells via harmonic forces. We demonstrate that, a simple evolution rule in which the polarization of any cell tends to orient with its velocity vector can induce coherent motion in geometrically confined environments. In addition to recapitulating coherent rotational motion observed in experiments, our results also show the presence of radial movements and tissue behavior that can vary between solid-like and fluid-like. We show that the pattern of coherent motion is dictated by the combination of different physical parameters including number density, cell motility, system size, bulk cell stiffness and stiffness of cell-cell adhesions. We further observe that perturbations in the form of cell division can induce a reversal in the direction of motion when cell division occurs synchronously. Moreover, when the confinement is removed, we see that the existing coherent motion leads to cell scattering, with bulk cell stiffness and stiffness of cell-cell contacts dictating the invasion pattern. In summary, our study provides an in-depth understanding of the origin of coherent rotation in confined tissues, and extracts useful insights into the influence of various physical parameters on the pattern of such movements.","[Soumya, S.

Within the cerebellum their direct upstream connections originate from inhibitory Purkinje neurons. Purkinje neurons have a complex firing pattern of regular spikes interrupted by intermittent pauses of variable length. How can the cerebellar nucleus process this complex input pattern? In this modeling study, we investigate different forms of Purkinje neuron simple spike pause synchrony and its influence on candidate coding strategies in the cerebellar nuclei. That is, we investigate how different alignments of synchronous pauses in synthetic Purkinje neuron spike trains affect either time-locking or rate-changes in the downstream nuclei. We find that Purkinje neuron synchrony is mainly represented by changes in the firing rate of cerebellar nuclei neurons. Pause beginning synchronization produced a unique effect on nuclei neuron firing, while the effect of pause ending and pause overlapping synchronization could not be distinguished from each other. Pause beginning synchronization produced better time-locking of nuclear neurons for short length pauses. We also characterize the effect of pause length and spike jitter on the nuclear neuron firing. Additionally, we find that the rate of rebound responses in nuclear neurons after a synchronous pause is controlled by the firing rate of Purkinje neurons preceding it.","[Sudhakar, Shyam Kumar; Torben-Nielsen, Benjamin; De Schutter, Erik] Okinawa Inst Sci & Technol, Computat Neurosci Unit, Onna Son, Okinawa, Japan; [Sudhakar, Shyam Kumar; De Schutter, Erik] Univ Antwerp, Lab Theoret Neurobiol & Neuroengn, Antwerp, Belgium; [Torben-Nielsen, Benjamin] Univ Hertfordshire, Biocomputat Res Grp, Hatfield AL10 9AB, Herts, England","Sudhakar, SK (reprint author), Okinawa Inst Sci & Technol, Computat Neurosci Unit, Onna Son, Okinawa, Japan.",erik@oist.jp,"De Schutter, Erik/G-8460-2011; Sudhakar, Shyam Kumar/K-9321-2019","De Schutter, Erik/0000-0001-8618-5138; ",Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology Graduate University,"This work was supported by funding from the Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology Graduate University.

For the auditory system, the FIR filter is instantiated in the spectro-temporal receptive field (STRF), often in the framework of the generalized linear model. Despite widespread use of the FIR STRF, numerous formulations for linear filters are possible that require many fewer parameters, potentially permitting more efficient and accurate model estimates. To explore these alternative STRF architectures, we recorded single-unit neural activity from auditory cortex of awake ferrets during presentation of natural sound stimuli. We compared performance of > 1000 linear STRF architectures, evaluating their ability to predict neural responses to a novel natural stimulus. Many were able to outperform the FIR filter. Two basic constraints on the architecture lead to the improved performance: (1) factorization of the STRF matrix into a small number of spectral and temporal filters and (2) low-dimensional parameterization of the factorized filters. The best parameterized model was able to outperform the full FIR filter in both primary and secondary auditory cortex, despite requiring fewer than 30 parameters, about 10% of the number required by the FIR filter. After accounting for noise from finite data sampling, these STRFs were able to explain an average of 40% of A1 response variance. The simpler models permitted more straightforward interpretation of sensory tuning properties. They also showed greater benefit from incorporating nonlinear terms, such as short term plasticity, that provide theoretical advances over the linear model. Architectures that minimize parameter count while maintaining maximum predictive power provide insight into the essential degrees of freedom governing auditory cortical function. They also maximize statistical power available for characterizing additional nonlinear properties that limit current auditory models.","[Thorson, Ivar L.; David, Stephen V.] Oregon Hlth & Sci Univ, Oregon Hearing Res Ctr, Portland, OR 97201 USA; [Lienard, Jean] Washington State Univ, Dept Math, Vancouver, WA USA","Thorson, IL (reprint author), Oregon Hlth & Sci Univ, Oregon Hearing Res Ctr, Portland, OR 97201 USA.",davids@ohsu.edu,,"Lienard, Jean/0000-0003-4279-4980",National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders [R00 DC010439],"Funding for this work was provided by the National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders (http://www.nidcd.nih.gov/), grant R00 DC010439.

Two main modes of single neuron dynamics-integration and resonance-have been distinguished. While resonator cell types exist in a variety of brain areas, few models incorporate this feature and fewer have investigated its effects. To understand better how a resonator's frequency preference emerges from its intrinsic dynamics and contributes to its local area's population firing rate dynamics, we analyze the dynamic gain of an analytically solvable two-degree of freedom neuron model. In the Fokker-Planck approach, the dynamic gain is intractable. The alternative Gauss-Rice approach lifts the resetting of the voltage after a spike. This allows us to derive a complete expression for the dynamic gain of a resonator neuron model in terms of a cascade of filters on the input. We find six distinct response types and use them to fully characterize the routes to resonance across all values of the relevant timescales. We find that resonance arises primarily due to slow adaptation with an intrinsic frequency acting to sharpen and adjust the location of the resonant peak. We determine the parameter regions for the existence of an intrinsic frequency and for subthreshold and spiking resonance, finding all possible intersections of the three. The expressions and analysis presented here provide an account of how intrinsic neuron dynamics shape dynamic population response properties and can facilitate the construction of an exact theory of correlations and stability of population activity in networks containing populations of resonator neurons.","[Touzel, Maximilian Puelma; Wolf, Fred] Max Planck Inst Dynam & Self Org, Dept Nonlinear Dynam, Gottingen, Germany; [Touzel, Maximilian Puelma; Wolf, Fred] Bernstein Ctr Computat Neurosci, Gottingen, Germany; [Touzel, Maximilian Puelma; Wolf, Fred] Univ Gottingen, Sch Sci, Inst Nonlinear Dynam, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany; [Wolf, Fred] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Kavli Inst Theoret Phys, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA","Touzel, MP (reprint author), Max Planck Inst Dynam & Self Org, Dept Nonlinear Dynam, Gottingen, Germany.",mptouzel@nld.ds.mpg.de,"889, CRC/L-1607-2018","889, CRC/0000-0002-6678-3138","Bundesministerium fur Bildungund Forschung [01GQ1005B, 01GQ07113, 01GQ0922]; German-Israeli Foundation [I-906-17.1/2006]; Volkswagenstiftung Stiftung [ZN2632]; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft [SFB889]; BMBF [01GQ0922]; Max Planck Society","We acknowledge the financial support by the Bundesministerium fur Bildungund Forschung (http://www.bmbf.de, 01GQ1005B, 01GQ07113, 01GQ0922), German-Israeli Foundation (http://www.gif.org.il, I-906-17.1/2006), Volkswagenstiftung Stiftung (http://www.volkswagenstiftung.de, ZN2632), Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (http://www.dfg.de/index.jsp, SFB889), BMBF: 01GQ0922 and the Max Planck Society (www.mpg.de).

Like other gene circuits, synthetic gene oscillators are noisy and exhibit fluctuations in amplitude and period. Understanding the origins of such variability is key to building predictive models that can guide the rational design of synthetic circuits. Here, we developed a method for determining the impact of different sources of noise in genetic oscillators by measuring the variability in oscillation amplitude and correlations between sister cells. We first used a combination of microfluidic devices and time-lapse fluorescence microscopy to track oscillations in cell lineages across many generations. We found that oscillation amplitude exhibited high cell-to-cell variability, while sister cells remained strongly correlated for many minutes after cell division. To understand how such variability arises, we constructed a computational model that identified the impact of various noise sources across the lineage of an initial cell. When each source of noise was appropriately tuned the model reproduced the experimentally observed amplitude variability and correlations, and accurately predicted outcomes under novel experimental conditions.

This can improve our understanding of cancer formation and progression. Although much progress has been made in terms of developing and analysing mathematical models, far less progress has been made in terms of understanding how to estimate model parameters using experimental in vitro image-based data. To address this issue, a new approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) algorithm is proposed to estimate key parameters governing the expansion of melanoma cell (MM127) colonies, including cell diffusivity, D, cell proliferation rate,., and cell-to-cell adhesion, q, in two experimental scenarios, namely with and without a chemical treatment to suppress cell proliferation. Even when little prior biological knowledge about the parameters is assumed, all parameters are precisely inferred with a small posterior coefficient of variation, approximately 2-12%. The ABC analyses reveal that the posterior distributions of D and q depend on the experimental elapsed time, whereas the posterior distribution of. does not. The posterior mean values of D and q are in the ranges 226-268 mu m(2)h(-1), 311-351 mu m(2)h(-1) and 0.23-0.39, 0.32-0.61 for the experimental periods of 0-24 h and 24-48 h, respectively. Furthermore, we found that the posterior distribution of q also depends on the initial cell density, whereas the posterior distributions of D and. do not.

This is puzzling, as cooperation is vulnerable to exploitation by defectors which enjoy a fitness advantage by consuming the common good without contributing fairly. Depletion of the common good can lead to population collapse and the destruction of cooperation. However, population collapse implies small population size, which, in a structured population, is known to favor cooperation. This happens because small population size increases variability in cooperator frequency across different locations. Since individuals in cooperator-dominated locations (which are most likely cooperators) will grow more than those in defector-dominated locations (which are most likely defectors), cooperators can outgrow defectors globally despite defectors outgrowing cooperators in each location. This raises the possibility that defectors can lead to conditions that sometimes rescue cooperation from defector-induced destruction. We demonstrate multiple mechanisms through which this can occur, using an individual-based approach to model stochastic birth, death, migration, and mutation events. First, during defector-induced population collapse, defectors occasionally go extinct before cooperators by chance, which allows cooperators to grow. Second, empty locations, either preexisting or created by defector-induced population extinction, can favor cooperation because they allow cooperator but not defector migrants to grow. These factors lead to the counterintuitive result that the initial presence of defectors sometimes allows better survival of cooperation compared to when defectors are initially absent. Finally, we find that resource limitation, inducible by defectors, can select for mutations adaptive to resource limitation. When these mutations are initially present at low levels or continuously generated at a moderate rate, they can favor cooperation by further reducing local population size. We predict that in a structured population, small population sizes precipitated by defectors provide a ""built-in"" mechanism for the persistence of cooperation.","[Waite, Adam James] Univ Washington, Mol & Cellular Biol Program, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Waite, Adam James; Cannistra, Caroline; Shou, Wenying] Fred Hutchinson Canc Res Ctr, Div Basic Sci, 1124 Columbia St, Seattle, WA 98104 USA","Waite, AJ (reprint author), Yale Univ, Dept Mol Cellular & Dev Biol, New Haven, CT USA.",adam.james.waite@gmail.com; wenying.shou@gmail.com,,"Waite, Adam/0000-0002-3537-7313; Shou, Wenying/0000-0001-5693-381X",Distinguished Young Scholar in Medical Research award from the W.

In vivo intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) data were acquired from 14 patients and IVUS-based 3D fluid-structure interaction (FSI) coronary plaque models with cyclic bending were constructed to obtain plaque wall stress/strain and flow shear stress for analysis. For the 617 slices from the 14 patients, lipid percentage, min cap thickness, critical plaque wall stress (CPWS), strain (CPWSn) and flow shear stress (CFSS) were recorded, and cap index, lipid index and morphological index were assigned to each slice using methods consistent with American Heart Association (AHA) plaque classification schemes. A stress index was introduced based on CPWS. Linear Mixed-Effects (LME) models were used to analyze the correlations between the mechanical and morphological indices and key morphological factors associated with plaque rupture. Our results indicated that for all 617 slices, CPWS correlated with min cap thickness, cap index, morphological index with r = -0.6414, 0.7852, and 0.7411 respectively (p<0.0001). The correlation between CPWS and lipid percentage, lipid index were weaker (r = 0.2445, r = 0.2338, p<0.0001). Stress index correlated with cap index, lipid index, morphological index positively with r = 0.8185, 0.3067, and 0.7715, respectively, all with p<0.0001. For all 617 slices, the stress index has 66.77% agreement with morphological index. Morphological and stress indices may serve as quantitative plaque vulnerability assessment supported by their strong correlations with morphological features associated with plaque rupture. Differences between the two indices may lead to better plaque assessment schemes when both indices were jointly used with further validations from clinical studies.","[Wang, Liang; Yang, Chun; Wu, Zheyang; Tang, Dalin] Worcester Polytech Inst, Dept Math Sci, Worcester, MA USA; [Zheng, Jie; Muccigrosso, David] Washington Univ, Mallinckrodt Inst Radiol, St Louis, MO USA; [Maehara, Akiko; Mintz, Gary S.] Cardiovasc Res Fdn, New York, NY USA; [Yang, Chun] China United Network Commun Co Ltd, Network Technol Res Inst, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Billiar, Kristen L.] Worcester Polytech Inst, Dept Biomed Engn, Worcester, MA USA; [Bach, Richard] Washington Univ, Sch Med, Cardiovasc Div, St Louis, MO USA; [Tang, Dalin] Southeast Univ, Sch Biol Sci & Med Engn, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China","Tang, DL (reprint author), Worcester Polytech Inst, Dept Math Sci, Worcester, MA USA.",dtang@wpi.edu,,,National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering [R01 EB004759]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [11171030],"This work was supported by the National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering, http://www.nibib.nih.gov/ R01 EB004759 to DT, JZ, RB, CY, GSM, AM; and the National Natural Science Foundation of China 11171030 to CY.

Some recent studies suggested that pyroptosis, a form of programmed cell death triggered during abortive HIV infection, is associated with the release of inflammatory cytokines, which can attract more CD4+ T cells to be infected. In this paper, we developed mathematical models to study whether this mechanism can explain the time scale of CD4+ T cell decline during HIV infection. Simulations of the models showed that cytokine induced T cell movement can explain the very slow decline of CD4+ T cells within untreated patients. The long-term CD4+ T cell dynamics predicted by the models were shown to be consistent with available data from patients in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Highly active antiretroviral therapy has the potential to restore the CD4+ T cell population but CD4+ response depends on the effectiveness of the therapy, when the therapy is initiated, and whether there are drug sanctuary sites. The model also showed that chronic inflammation induced by pyroptosis may facilitate persistence of the HIV latent reservoir by promoting homeostatic proliferation of memory CD4+ cells. These results improve our understanding of the long-term T cell dynamics in HIV-1 infection, and support that new treatment strategies, such as the use of caspase-1 inhibitors that inhibit pyroptosis, may maintain the CD4+ T cell population and reduce the latent reservoir size.","[Wang, Sunpeng] NYU, Dept Biol, New York, NY 10003 USA; [Hottz, Patricia; Schechter, Mauro] Univ Fed Rio de Janeiro, Fac Med, Dept Med Prevent, Rio De Janeiro, Brazil; [Schechter, Mauro] Univ Fed Rio de Janeiro, Hosp Escola Sao Francisco Assis, Projeto Praca Onze, Rio De Janeiro, Brazil; [Rong, Libin] Oakland Univ, Dept Math & Stat, Rochester, MI 48063 USA; [Rong, Libin] Oakland Univ, Ctr Biomed Res, Rochester, MI 48063 USA","Rong, LB (reprint author), Oakland Univ, Dept Math & Stat, Rochester, MI 48063 USA.; Rong, LB (reprint author), Oakland Univ, Ctr Biomed Res, Rochester, MI 48063 USA.",rong2@oakland.edu,,,"NSF [DMS-1122290, DMS-1349939]","LR is supported by NSF grants DMS-1122290 and DMS-1349939.

We find that in a noisy group of phase oscillators, high frequency perturbations can separate the population into multiple clusters, each with a nearly identical proportion of the overall population. This phenomenon can be understood by studying maps of the underlying deterministic system and is guaranteed to be observed for small noise strengths. When we apply this framework to populations of Type I and Type II neurons, we observe clustered desynchronization at many pulsing frequencies.","[Wilson, Dan; Moehlis, Jeff] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Mech Engn, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA","Wilson, D (reprint author), Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Mech Engn, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA.",dan.d.wilson8@gmail.com,,,National Science Foundation [NSF-1264535],"Support for this work by National Science Foundation Grant NSF-1264535 is gratefully acknowledged.

There are three possible strategies with respect to SC fate decision symmetry: (a) asymmetric mode, when each and every SC division produces one SC and one non-SC progeny; (b) symmetric mode, when 50% of all divisions produce two SCs and another 50%-two non-SC progeny; (c) mixed mode, when both the asymmetric and two types of symmetric SC divisions co-exist and are partitioned so that long-term net balance of the lineage output stays constant. Theoretically, either of these strategies can achieve lineage homeostasis. However, it remains unclear which strategy(s) are more advantageous and under what specific circumstances, and what minimal control mechanisms are required to operate them. Here we used stochastic modeling to analyze and quantify the ability of different types of divisions to maintain long-term lineage homeostasis, in the context of different control networks. Using the example of a two-component lineage, consisting of SCs and one type of non-SC progeny, we show that its tight homeostatic control is not necessarily associated with purely asymmetric divisions. Through stochastic analysis and simulations we show that asymmetric divisions can either stabilize or destabilize the lineage system, depending on the underlying control network. We further apply our computational model to biological observations in the context of a two-component lineage of mouse epidermis, where autonomous lineage control has been proposed and notable regional differences, in terms of symmetric division ratio, have been noted-higher in thickened epidermis of the paw skin as compared to ear and tail skin. By using our model we propose a possible explanation for the regional differences in epidermal lineage control strategies. We demonstrate how symmetric divisions can work to stabilize paw epidermis lineage, which experiences high level of micro-injuries and a lack of hair follicles as a backup source of SCs.","[Yang, Jienian; Komarova, Natalia L.] Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Math, Irvine, CA 92717 USA; [Plikus, Maksim V.] Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Dev & Cell Biol, Sue & Bill Gross Stem Cell Res Ctr, Irvine, CA 92717 USA; [Plikus, Maksim V.] Univ Calif Irvine, Ctr Complex Biol Syst, Irvine, CA USA; [Komarova, Natalia L.] Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Irvine, CA 92717 USA","Yang, JN (reprint author), Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Math, Irvine, CA 92717 USA.",komarova@uci.edu,,,NIH [1 U01 CA187956-01]; NIH National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases (NIAMS) [R01-AR067273]; Edward Mallinckrodt Jr. Foundation; University of California Cancer Research Coordinating Committee,"NLK gratefully acknowledges the support of NIH grant 1 U01 CA187956-01.

As most of these are observed in the heterozygous state, they test a gene's tolerance to haploinsufficiency and dominant loss of function. We analyzed the distribution of truncating variants across 16,260 autosomal protein coding genes in 11,546 individuals. We observed 39,893 truncating variants affecting 12,062 genes, which significantly differed from an expectation of 12,916 genes under a model of neutral de novo mutation (p<10(-4)). Extrapolating this to increasing numbers of sequenced individuals, we estimate that 10.8% of human genes do not tolerate heterozygous truncating variants. An additional 10 to 15% of truncated genes may be rescued by incomplete penetrance or compensatory mutations, or because the truncating variants are of limited functional impact. The study of protein truncating variants delineates the essential genome and, more generally, identifies rare heterozygous variants as an unexplored source of diversity of phenotypic traits and diseases.","[Bartha, Istvan; Rausell, Antonio; McLaren, Paul J.; Mohammadi, Pejman; Tardaguila, Manuel; Chaturvedi, Nimisha; Fellay, Jacques] SIB, Lausanne, Switzerland; [Bartha, Istvan; Rausell, Antonio; McLaren, Paul J.; Mohammadi, Pejman; Tardaguila, Manuel; Chaturvedi, Nimisha; Fellay, Jacques] SIB, Basel, Switzerland; [Bartha, Istvan; McLaren, Paul J.; Chaturvedi, Nimisha; Fellay, Jacques] Ecole Polytech Fed Lausanne, Sch Life Sci, Lausanne, Switzerland; [Rausell, Antonio; Tardaguila, Manuel] SIB, Vital IT Grp, Lausanne, Switzerland; [Mohammadi, Pejman] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Computat Biol Grp, Zurich, Switzerland; [Telenti, Amalio] J Craig Venter Inst, La Jolla, CA USA","Telenti, A (reprint author), J Craig Venter Inst, La Jolla, CA USA.",atelenti@jcvi.org,"Fellay, Jacques/A-6681-2009; Rausell, Antonio/I-9071-2017; SHCS, all/G-4072-2011; SHCS, int. coll.

These tools enable quantification, in the native environment of the cell, of molecular interactions and the formation of higher-order molecular complexes. The capabilities and limitations of these analytical tools are demonstrated using both modeled data and examples derived from the vesicular trafficking system, thereby providing an established and validated experimental workflow capable of quantitatively assessing molecular interactions and molecular complex formation within the heterogeneous environment of the cell.","[Caetano, Fabiana A.; Tam, Joshua H.

In the case of drug resistant epilepsy resective surgery is often considered. This is a procedure hampered by unpredictable success rates, with many patients continuing to have seizures even after surgery. In this study we apply a computational model of epilepsy to patient specific structural connectivity derived from diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) of 22 individuals with left TLE and 39 healthy controls. We validate the model by examining patient-control differences in simulated seizure onset time and network location. We then investigate the potential of the model for surgery prediction by performing in silico surgical resections, removing nodes from patient networks and comparing seizure likelihood post-surgery to pre-surgery simulations. We find that, first, patients tend to transit from non-epileptic to epileptic states more often than controls in the model. Second, regions in the left hemisphere (particularly within temporal and subcortical regions) that are known to be involved in TLE are the most frequent starting points for seizures in patients in the model. In addition, our analysis also implicates regions in the contralateral and frontal locations which may play a role in seizure spreading or surgery resistance. Finally, the model predicts that patient-specific surgery (resection areas chosen on an individual, model-prompted, basis and not following a predefined procedure) may lead to better outcomes than the currently used routine clinical procedure. Taken together this work provides a first step towards patient specific computational modelling of epilepsy surgery in order to inform treatment strategies in individuals.","[Hutchings, Frances; Taylor, Peter N.; Kaiser, Marcus] Newcastle Univ, Sch Comp Sci, Interdisciplinary Comp & Complex BioSyst, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 7RU, Tyne & Wear, England; [Han, Cheol E.] Korea Univ, Dept Biomed Engn, Seoul, South Korea; [Han, Cheol E.] Seoul Natl Univ, Dept Brain Cognit Sci, Seoul, South Korea; [Keller, Simon S.] Univ Liverpool, Inst Translat Med, Dept Mol & Clin Pharmacol, Liverpool L69 3BX, Merseyside, England; [Weber, Bernd] Univ Bonn, Ctr Econ & Neurosci, Bonn, Germany; [Weber, Bernd] Univ Bonn, Dept Epileptol, Bonn, Germany; [Taylor, Peter N.; Kaiser, Marcus] Newcastle Univ, Inst Neurosci, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 7RU, Tyne & Wear, England","Hutchings, F (reprint author), Newcastle Univ, Sch Comp Sci, Interdisciplinary Comp & Complex BioSyst, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 7RU, Tyne & Wear, England.",f.hutchings@newcastle.ac.uk,"Kaiser, Marcus/A-7166-2008; Kaiser, Marcus/N-3350-2019; Weber, Bernd/H-5244-2012; Weber, Bernd/L-9702-2019; Taylor, Peter/E-8927-2011","Kaiser, Marcus/0000-0002-4654-3110; Kaiser, Marcus/0000-0002-4654-3110; Weber, Bernd/0000-0002-7811-9605; Weber, Bernd/0000-0002-7811-9605; Taylor, Peter/0000-0003-2144-9838; Keller, Simon/0000-0001-5247-9795","Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council of the United Kingdom [EP/K026992/1]; Human Brain Development Project; Medical Research Council New Investigator Research Grant [MR/K023152/1]; National Research Foundation of South Korea - Ministry of Education, Science and Technology [R32-10142, MSIP-2010-0028631, MSIP-2013-004157, MSIP-R1A1A1008173]; Heisenberg Grant of the German Research Council (DFG) [We 4427/3-2]; Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council of the United Kingdom; Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council [EP/K026992/1, 1516871]; Medical Research Council [MR/K023152/1]","PNT and MK were supported by the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council of the United Kingdom (EP/K026992/1) as part of the Human Brain Development Project (http://www.greenbrainproject.org/).

Early studies indicated that the brain might use blind source separation as a signal processing strategy for sensory perception and numerous mathematical models have been proposed; however, it remains unclear how the neural networks extract particular sources from a complex mixture of inputs. We discovered that neurons in cultures of dissociated rat cortical cells could learn to represent particular sources while filtering out other signals. Specifically, the distinct classes of neurons in the culture learned to respond to the distinct sources after repeating training stimulation.

Clinically, seizure foci are considered optimal targets for surgery. However, poor surgical outcome suggests a complex relationship between foci and the surrounding network that drives seizure dynamics. We developed a novel technique to objectively track seizure states from dynamic functional networks constructed from intracranial recordings. Each dynamical state captures unique patterns of network connections that indicate synchronized and desynchronized hubs of neural populations. Our approach suggests that seizures are generated when synchronous relationships near foci work in tandem with rapidly changing desynchronous relationships from the surrounding epileptic network. As seizures progress, topographical and geometrical changes in network connectivity strengthen and tighten synchronous connectivity near foci-a mechanism that may aid seizure termination. Collectively, our observations implicate distributed cortical structures in seizure generation, propagation and termination, and may have practical significance in determining which circuits to modulate with implantable devices.","[Khambhati, Ankit N.; Litt, Brian; Bassett, Danielle S.] Univ Penn, Dept Bioengn, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Khambhati, Ankit N.; Davis, Kathryn A.; Oommen, Brian S.; Chen, Stephanie H.; Lucas, Timothy H.; Litt, Brian; Bassett, Danielle S.] Univ Penn, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Davis, Kathryn A.; Oommen, Brian S.; Chen, Stephanie H.; Litt, Brian] Hosp Univ Penn, Dept Neurol, 3400 Spruce St, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Lucas, Timothy H.] Hosp Univ Penn, Dept Neurosurg, 3400 Spruce St, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Bassett, Danielle S.] Univ Penn, Dept Elect & Syst Engn, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA","Bassett, DS (reprint author), Univ Penn, Dept Bioengn, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.",dsb@seas.upenn.edu,,,"National Institutes of Health [R01-NS063039, 1U24 NS 63930-01A1]; Neil and Barbara Smit; Citizens United for Research in Epilepsy (CURE) through Julie's Hope Award; Mirowski Foundation; John D. and Catherine T.

Novel and non-routine tasks, for example, are implemented faster than structural connections can be formed. The neural underpinnings of these dynamics are far from understood. Here we develop and apply novel methods in network science to quantify how patterns of functional connectivity between brain regions reconfigure as human subjects perform 64 different tasks. By applying dynamic community detection algorithms, we identify groups of brain regions that form putative functional communities, and we uncover changes in these groups across the 64-task battery. We summarize these reconfiguration patterns by quantifying the probability that two brain regions engage in the same network community (or putative functional module) across tasks. These tools enable us to demonstrate that classically defined cognitive systems-including visual, sensorimotor, auditory, default mode, fronto-parietal, cingulo-opercular and salience systems-engage dynamically in cohesive network communities across tasks. We define the network role that a cognitive system plays in these dynamics along the following two dimensions: (i) stability vs. flexibility and (ii) connected vs. isolated. The role of each system is therefore summarized by how stably that system is recruited over the 64 tasks, and how consistently that system interacts with other systems. Using this cartography, classically defined cognitive systems can be categorized as ephemeral integrators, stable loners, and anything in between. Our results provide a new conceptual framework for understanding the dynamic integration and recruitment of cognitive systems in enabling behavioral adaptability across both task and rest conditions. This work has important implications for understanding cognitive network reconfiguration during different task sets and its relationship to cognitive effort, individual variation in cognitive performance, and fatigue.","[Mattar, Marcelo G.; Thompson-Schill, Sharon L.] Univ Penn, Dept Psychol, 3815 Walnut St, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Cole, Michael W.] Rutgers State Univ, Ctr Mol & Behav Neurosci, Newark, NJ 07102 USA; [Bassett, Danielle S.] Univ Penn, Dept Bioengn, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Bassett, Danielle S.] Univ Penn, Dept Elect & Syst Engn, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA","Bassett, DS (reprint author), Univ Penn, Dept Bioengn, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.",dsb@seas.upenn.edu,"Cole, Michael W./G-1056-2010","Cole, Michael W./0000-0003-4329-438X; Mattar, Marcelo G/0000-0003-3303-2490","NIH [R01 EY021717-01, K99/R00MH096801]; John D. and Catherine T.

An important role in the generation of these oscillations is thought to be played by the motor cortex and by a network composed of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) and the external segment of globus pallidus (GPe). Several alternative models have been proposed to describe the mechanisms for generation of the Parkinsonian beta oscillations. However, a recent experimental study of Tachibana and colleagues yielded results which are challenging for all published computational models of beta generation. That study investigated how the presence of beta oscillations in a primate model of Parkinson's disease is affected by blocking different connections of the STN-GPe circuit. Due to a large number of experimental conditions, the study provides strong constraints that any mechanistic model of beta generation should satisfy. In this paper we present two models consistent with the data of Tachibana et al. The first model assumes that Parkinsonian beta oscillation are generated in the cortex and the STN-GPe circuits resonates at this frequency. The second model additionally assumes that the feedback from STN-GPe circuit to cortex is important for maintaining the oscillations in the network. Predictions are made about experimental evidence that is required to differentiate between the two models, both of which are able to reproduce firing rates, oscillation frequency and effects of lesions carried out by Tachibana and colleagues. Furthermore, an analysis of the models reveals how the amplitude and frequency of the generated oscillations depend on parameters.","[Pavlides, Alex; Bogacz, Rafal] Univ Oxford, MRC Unit Brain Network Dynam, Oxford, England; [Pavlides, Alex; Bogacz, Rafal] Univ Oxford, John Radcliffe Hosp, Nuffield Dept Clin Neurosci, Oxford OX3 9DU, England; [Pavlides, Alex; Hogan, S.

While modeling receptor flexibility is important for correctly predicting ligand binding, it still remains challenging. This work focuses on an approach in which receptor flexibility is modeled by explicitly specifying a set of receptor side-chains a-priori. The challenges of this approach include the: 1) exponential growth of the search space, demanding more efficient search methods; and 2) increased number of false positives, calling for scoring functions tailored for flexible receptor docking. We present AutoDockFR-AutoDock for Flexible Receptors (ADFR), a new docking engine based on the AutoDock4 scoring function, which addresses the aforementioned challenges with a new Genetic Algorithm (GA) and customized scoring function. We validate ADFR using the Astex Diverse Set, demonstrating an increase in efficiency and reliability of its GA over the one implemented in AutoDock4. We demonstrate greatly increased success rates when cross-docking ligands into apo receptors that require side-chain conformational changes for ligand binding. These cross-docking experiments are based on two datasets: 1) SEQ17 -a receptor diversity set containing 17 pairs of apo-holo structures; and 2) CDK2 -a ligand diversity set composed of one CDK2 apo structure and 52 known bound inhibitors. We show that, when cross-docking ligands into the apo conformation of the receptors with up to 14 flexible side-chains, ADFR reports more correctly cross-docked ligands than AutoDock Vina on both datasets with solutions found for 70.6% vs. 35.3% systems on SEQ17, and 76.9% vs. 61.5% on CDK2. ADFR also outperforms AutoDock Vina in number of top ranking solutions on both datasets. Furthermore, we show that correctly docked CDK2 complexes re-create on average 79.8% of all pairwise atomic interactions between the ligand and moving receptor atoms in the holo complexes. Finally, we show that down-weighting the receptor internal energy improves the ranking of correctly docked poses and that runtime for AutoDockFR scales linearly when side-chain flexibility is added.","[Ravindranath, Pradeep Anand; Forli, Stefano; Goodsell, David S.; Olson, Arthur J.; Sanner, Michel F.] Scripps Res Inst, Dept Integrat Struct & Computat Biol, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA","Ravindranath, PA (reprint author), Scripps Res Inst, Dept Integrat Struct & Computat Biol, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA.",sanner@scripps.edu,,,National Institute of Health [R01 GM096888-05],"This work was supported by grant R01 GM096888-05 from the National Institute of Health to MFS.

Since RNA-Seq data alone is often not sufficient to accurately identify the read origins from the isoforms for quantification, we propose to explore protein domain-domain interactions as prior knowledge for integrative analysis with RNA-Seq data. We introduce a Network-based method for RNA-Seq-based Transcript Quantification (Net-RSTQ) to integrate protein domain-domain interaction network with short read alignments for transcript abundance estimation. Based on our observation that the abundances of the neighboring isoforms by domain-domain interactions in the network are positively correlated, Net-RSTQ models the expression of the neighboring transcripts as Dirichlet priors on the likelihood of the observed read alignments against the transcripts in one gene. The transcript abundances of all the genes are then jointly estimated with alternating optimization of multiple EM problems. In simulation Net-RSTQ effectively improved isoform transcript quantifications when isoform co-expressions correlate with their interactions. qRT-PCR results on 25 multi-isoform genes in a stem cell line, an ovarian cancer cell line, and a breast cancer cell line also showed that Net-RSTQ estimated more consistent isoform proportions with RNA-Seq data. In the experiments on the RNA-Seq data in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), the transcript abundances estimated by Net-RSTQ are more informative for patient sample classification of ovarian cancer, breast cancer and lung cancer. All experimental results collectively support that Net-RSTQ is a promising approach for isoform quantification.

Previous studies have predicted that animals should perform a special class of random walks, called Levy walk, to obtain more targets. However, some empirical studies did not support this hypothesis, and the relationship between search strategy and ecological factors is still unclear. We focused on ecological factors, such as predation risk, and analyzed whether Levy walk may not be favored. It was remarkable that the ecological factors often altered an optimal search strategy from Levy walk to Brownian walk, depending on the speed of the predator's movement, density of predators, etc. This occurred because higher target encounter rates simultaneously led searchers to higher predation risks. Our findings indicate that animals may not perform Levy walks often, and we suggest that it is crucial to consider the ecological context for evaluating the search strategy performed by animals in the field.","[Abe, Masato S.; Shimada, Masakazu] Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Arts & Sci, Dept Gen Syst Studies, Tokyo, Japan","Abe, MS (reprint author), JST, Kawarabayashi Large Graph Project, ERATO, Tokyo, Japan.",masatoabee@gmail.com,,,"Japan Society for the Promotion of Science for Young Scientists [23-10448]; Research and Education Platform for Dynamic Living States from the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan","MSA was supported by a Research Fellowship from the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science for Young Scientists (23-10448).

H2O2 diffuses freely into bacteria, where it can wreak havoc on sensitive biomolecules if it is not rapidly detoxified. Accordingly, bacteria have evolved numerous systems to defend themselves against H2O2, and the importance of these systems to pathogenesis has been substantiated by the many bacteria that require them to establish or sustain infections. The kinetic competition for H2O2 within bacteria is complex, which suggests that quantitative models will improve interpretation and prediction of network behavior. To date, such models have been of limited scope, and this inspired us to construct a quantitative, systems-level model of H2O2 detoxification in Escherichia coli that includes detoxification enzymes, H2O2-dependent transcriptional regulation, enzyme degradation, the Fenton reaction and damage caused by center dot OH, oxidation of biomolecules by H2O2, and repair processes. After using an iterative computational and experimental procedure to train the model, we leveraged it to predict how H2O2 detoxification would change in response to an environmental perturbation that pathogens encounter within host phagosomes, carbon source deprivation, which leads to translational inhibition and limited availability of NADH. We found that the model accurately predicted that NADH depletion would delay clearance at low H2O2 concentrations and that detoxification at higher concentrations would resemble that of carbon-replete conditions. These results suggest that protein synthesis during bolus H2O2 stress does not affect clearance dynamics and that access to catabolites only matters at low H2O2 concentrations. We anticipate that this model will serve as a computational tool for the quantitative exploration and dissection of oxidative stress in bacteria, and that the model and methods used to develop it will provide important templates for the generation of comparable models for other bacterial species.","[Adolfsen, Kristin J.; Brynildsen, Mark P.] Princeton Univ, Dept Chem & Biol Engn, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA","Brynildsen, MP (reprint author), Princeton Univ, Dept Chem & Biol Engn, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA.",mbrynild@princeton.edu,,,Princeton University,"This work was supported by Princeton University (Forese Family Fund for Innovation, startup funds).

To improve our knowledge of its dynamics, we conducted a modelling study based on multi-modal data from an orthotopic murine experimental system of metastatic renal cell carcinoma. The standard theory of metastatic colonization usually assumes that secondary tumours, once established at a distant site, grow independently from each other and from the primary tumour. Using a mathematical model that translates this assumption into equations, we challenged this theory against our data that included: 1) dynamics of primary tumour cells in the kidney and metastatic cells in the lungs, retrieved by green fluorescent protein tracking, and 2) magnetic resonance images (MRI) informing on the number and size of macroscopic lesions. Critically, when calibrated on the growth of the primary tumour and total metastatic burden, the predicted theoretical size distributions were not in agreement with the MRI observations. Moreover, tumour expansion only based on proliferation was not able to explain the volume increase of the metastatic lesions. These findings strongly suggested rejection of the standard theory, demonstrating that the time development of the size distribution of metastases could not be explained by independent growth of metastatic foci. This led us to investigate the effect of spatial interactions between merging metastatic tumours on the dynamics of the global metastatic burden. We derived a mathematical model of spatial tumour growth, confronted it with experimental data of single metastatic tumour growth, and used it to provide insights on the dynamics of multiple tumours growing in close vicinity. Together, our results have implications for theories of the metastatic process and suggest that global dynamics of metastasis development is dependent on spatial interactions between metastatic lesions.","[Baratchart, Etienne; Benzekry, Sebastien; Colin, Thierry; Saut, Olivier] INRIA Bordeaux Sud Ouest Team MONC, Talence, France; [Baratchart, Etienne; Benzekry, Sebastien; Colin, Thierry; Saut, Olivier] Univ Bordeaux, IMB, UMR 5251, Talence, France; [Baratchart, Etienne; Benzekry, Sebastien; Colin, Thierry; Saut, Olivier] CNRS, IMB, UMR 5251, Talence, France; [Baratchart, Etienne; Benzekry, Sebastien; Colin, Thierry; Saut, Olivier] Bordeaux INP, IMB, UMR 5251, Talence, France; [Bikfalvi, Andreas; Cooley, Lindsay S.; Pineau, Raphael; Souleyreau, Wilfried] Univ Bordeaux, INSERM U1029, LAMC, Pessac, France; [Ribot, Emeline J.] Univ Bordeaux Segalen, CNRS, Ctr Resonance Magnet Syst Biol, UMR 5536, Bordeaux, France","Baratchart, E (reprint author), INRIA Bordeaux Sud Ouest Team MONC, Talence, France.",sebastien.benzekry@inria.fr; andreas.bikfalvi@u-bordeaux.fr; Thierry.Colin@math.u-bordeaux1.fr,,"Benzekry, Sebastien/0000-0002-3749-8637; RIBOT, Emeline/0000-0002-3063-1263","PlanCancer from the National Cancer Institute (INCA); National Institute of Health and Medical Research (INSERM); MetaSys Grant; French State [ANR-10-LABX-0057, ANR-10-IDEX-03-02]","The authors would like to thank the PlanCancer from the National Cancer Institute (INCA) and the National Institute of Health and Medical Research (INSERM) for financial support of this project (MetaSys grant to AB and TC).

We propose a model of collision avoidance inspired by behavioral experiments on insects and by properties of optic flow on a spherical eye experienced during translation, and test the interaction of this model with goal-driven behavior. Insects, such as flies and bees, actively separate the rotational and translational optic flow components via behavior, i.e. by employing a saccadic strategy of flight and gaze control. Optic flow experienced during translation, i.e. during intersaccadic phases, contains information on the depth-structure of the environment, but this information is entangled with that on self-motion. Here, we propose a simple model to extract the depth structure from translational optic flow by using local properties of a spherical eye. On this basis, a motion direction of the agent is computed that ensures collision avoidance. Flying insects are thought to measure optic flow by correlation-type elementary motion detectors. Their responses depend, in addition to velocity, on the texture and contrast of objects and, thus, do not measure the velocity of objects veridically. Therefore, we initially used geometrically determined optic flow as input to a collision avoidance algorithm to show that depth information inferred from optic flow is sufficient to account for collision avoidance under closed-loop conditions. Then, the collision avoidance algorithm was tested with bio-inspired correlation-type elementary motion detectors in its input. Even then, the algorithm led successfully to collision avoidance and, in addition, replicated the characteristics of collision avoidance behavior of insects. Finally, the collision avoidance algorithm was combined with a goal direction and tested in cluttered environments. The simulated agent then showed goal-directed behavior reminiscent of components of the navigation behavior of insects.","[Bertrand, Olivier J.

One of the most prominent theoretical models of neural sequence generation is the synfire chain, in which pulses of synchronized spiking activity propagate robustly along a chain of cells connected by highly redundant feedforward excitation. But recent experimental observations in the avian song production pathway during song generation have shown excitatory activity interacting strongly with the firing patterns of inhibitory neurons, suggesting a process of sequence generation more complex than feedforward excitation. Here we propose a model of sequence generation inspired by these observations in which a pulse travels along a spatially recurrent excitatory chain, passing repeatedly through zones of local feedback inhibition. In this model, synchrony and robust timing are maintained not through redundant excitatory connections, but rather through the interaction between the pulse and the spatiotemporal pattern of inhibition that it creates as it circulates the network. These results suggest that spatially and temporally structured inhibition may play a key role in sequence generation.","[Cannon, Jonathan; Kopell, Nancy] Boston Univ, Dept Math, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Cannon, Jonathan] Brandeis Univ, Dept Biol, Waltham, MA 02254 USA; [Gardner, Timothy; Markowitz, Jeffrey] Boston Univ, Dept Biol, Boston, MA 02215 USA","Cannon, J (reprint author), Boston Univ, Dept Math, Boston, MA 02215 USA.",cannon@brandeis.edu,,"Cannon, Jonathan/0000-0001-7561-6529",National Science Foundation Science of Learning Center CELEST [SBE-0354378]; National Institutes of Health [1R01NS089679],"This work was supported by the National Science Foundation (http://www.nsf.gov/) Science of Learning Center CELEST (grant number SBE-0354378) and the National Institutes of Health (http://www.nih.gov/) (grant number 1R01NS089679).

The ""omics"" fields, especially genomics, are increasingly dependent on the effective interpretation of large and complex sets of data. Despite abundant natural resources and population sizes comparable with many first-world countries from which talent could be drawn, countries in Africa still lag far behind the rest of the world in terms of specialized skills development. Moreover, there are serious concerns about disparities between countries within the continent. The multidisciplinary nature of the bioinformatics field, coupled with rare and depleting expertise, is a critical problem for the advancement of bioinformatics in Africa. We propose a formalized matchmaking system, which is aimed at reversing this trend, by introducing the Knowledge Transfer Programme (KTP). Instead of individual researchers travelling to other labs to learn, researchers with desirable skills are invited to join African research groups for six weeks to six months. Visiting researchers or trainers will pass on their expertise to multiple people simultaneously in their local environments, thus increasing the efficiency of knowledge transference. In return, visiting researchers have the opportunity to develop professional contacts, gain industry work experience, work with novel datasets, and strengthen and support their ongoing research.

The development of novel single-cell sequencing and imaging techniques, as well as a better exploitation of currently available single-molecule imaging techniques, provides an avenue to interrogate the process of transcription and its dynamics in cells by quantifying the number of RNA polymerases engaged in the transcription of a gene (or equivalently the number of nascent RNAs) at a given moment in time. In this paper, we propose that measurements of the cell-to-cell variability in the number of nascent RNAs provide a mostly unexplored method for deciphering mechanisms of transcription initiation in cells. We propose a simple kinetic model of transcription initiation and elongation from which we calculate nascent RNA copy-number fluctuations. To demonstrate the usefulness of this approach, we test our theory against published nascent RNA data for twelve constitutively expressed yeast genes. Rather than transcription being initiated through a single rate limiting step, as it had been previously proposed, our single-cell analysis reveals the presence of at least two rate limiting steps. Surprisingly, half of the genes analyzed have nearly identical rates of transcription initiation, suggesting a common mechanism. Our analytical framework can be used to extract quantitative information about dynamics of transcription from single-cell sequencing data, as well as from single-molecule imaging and electron micrographs of fixed cells, and provides the mathematical means to exploit the quantitative power of these technologies.","[Choubey, Sandeep; Kondev, Jane] Brandeis Univ, Dept Phys, Waltham, MA 02254 USA; [Sanchez, Alvaro] Harvard Univ, Rowland Inst Harvard, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA","Choubey, S (reprint author), Brandeis Univ, Dept Phys, Waltham, MA 02254 USA.",sanchez@rowland.harvard.edu,,,National Science Foundation [DMR-1206146]; Junior Fellowship from the Rowland Institute at Harvard,"This work was supported by National Science Foundation: grant DMR-1206146 to JK.

We report herein that high-throughput chemical experiments can isolate an RNA's multiple alternative secondary structures as they are stabilized by systematic mutagenesis (mutate-and-map, M-2) and that a computational algorithm, REEFFIT, enables unbiased reconstruction of these states' structures and populations. In an in silico benchmark on non-coding RNAs with complex landscapes, M-2-REEFFIT recovers 95% of RNA helices present with at least 25% population while maintaining a low false discovery rate (10%) and conservative error estimates. In experimental benchmarks, M-2-REEFFIT recovers the structure landscapes of a 35-nt MedLoop hairpin, a 110-nt 16S rRNA four-way junction with an excited state, a 25-nt bistable hairpin, and a 112-nt three-state adenine riboswitch with its expression platform, molecules whose characterization previously required expert mutational analysis and specialized NMR or chemical mapping experiments. With this validation, M-2-REEFFIT enabled tests of whether artificial RNA sequences might exhibit complex landscapes in the absence of explicit design. An artificial flavin mononucleotide riboswitch and a randomly generated RNA sequence are found to interconvert between three or more states, including structures for which there was no design, but that could be stabilized through mutations. These results highlight the likely pervasiveness of rich landscapes with multiple secondary structures in both natural and artificial RNAs and demonstrate an automated chemical/computational route for their empirical characterization.","[Cordero, Pablo; Das, Rhiju] Stanford Univ, Biomed Informat Program, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Cordero, Pablo; Das, Rhiju] Stanford Univ, Dept Biochem, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Das, Rhiju] Stanford Univ, Dept Phys, Stanford, CA 94305 USA","Cordero, P (reprint author), Stanford Univ, Biomed Informat Program, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",rhiju@stanford.edu,,"Das, Rhiju/0000-0001-7497-0972",Stanford Bio-X Interdisciplinary Initiative Program; Stanford Media-X; CONACyT; Burroughs-Wellcome Foundation; Keck Medical Research Foundation; National Institutes of Health [R01 R01GM100953],"This work was funded by the Stanford Bio-X Interdisciplinary Initiative Program, Stanford Media-X, a CONACyT graduate student fellowship (to PC), a Burroughs-Wellcome Foundation Career Award (to RD), the Keck Medical Research Foundation, and National Institutes of Health Grant R01 R01GM100953.

The kinetics and energetics of the process as well as how it proceeds with substantial conformational changes of the polymerase complex determine the mechano-chemical coupling mechanism of the transcription elongation. Here we investigated detailed dynamics of the PPi release process in a single-subunit RNA polymerase (RNAP) from bacteriophage T7, implementing all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. We obtained a jump-from-cavity kinetic model of the PPi release utilizing extensive nanosecond MD simulations. We found that the PPi release in T7 RNAP is initiated by the PPi dissociation from two catalytic aspartic acids, followed by a comparatively slow jump-from-cavity activation process. Combining with a number of microsecond long MD simulations, we also found that the activation process is hindered by charged residue associations as well as by local steric and hydrogen bond interactions. On the other hand, the activation is greatly assisted by a highly flexible lysine residue Lys472 that swings its side chain to pull PPi out. The mechanism can apply in general to single subunit RNA and DNA polymerases with similar molecular structures and conserved key residues. Remarkably, the flexible lysine or arginine residue appears to be a universal module that assists the PPi release even in multi-subunit RNAPs with charge facilitated hopping mechanisms. We also noticed that the PPi release is not tightly coupled to opening motions of an O-helix on the fingers domain of T7 RNAP according to the microsecond MD simulations. Our study thus supports the Brownian ratchet scenario of the mechano-chemical coupling in the transcription elongation of the single-subunit polymerase.","[Da, Lin-Tai] Florida State Univ, Dept Phys, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA; [Da, Lin-Tai] Florida State Univ, Inst Mol Biophys, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA; [Chao, E.; Duan, Baogen; Yu, Jin] Beijing Computat Sci Res Ctr, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Chuanbiao; Zhou, Xin] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Sch Phys, Beijing, Peoples R China","Da, LT (reprint author), Beijing Computat Sci Res Ctr, Beijing, Peoples R China.",jinyu@csrc.ac.cn,"Da, Lin-Tai/B-2356-2017","Da, Lin-Tai/0000-0002-1589-5754; Yu, Jin/0000-0001-8224-1374",National Science Foundation of China [11275022],"JY receives funding from National Science Foundation of China Grant #11275022 http://www.nsfc.gov.cn.

We use a computational model to test whether hypothesised sensorimotor control mechanisms are sufficient to account for larval behaviour. The model combines three mechanisms based on simple transformations of the recent history of odour intensity at the head location. The first is an increased probability of terminating runs in response to gradually decreasing concentration, the second an increased probability of terminating head casts in response to rapidly increasing concentration, and the third a biasing of run directions up concentration gradients through modulation of small head casts. We show that this model can be tuned to produce behavioural statistics comparable to those reported for the larva, and that this tuning results in similar chemotaxis performance to the larva. We demonstrate that each mechanism can enable odour approach but the combination of mechanisms is most effective, and investigate how these low-level control mechanisms relate to behavioural measures such as the preference indices used to investigate larval learning behaviour in group assays.","[Davies, Alex; Webb, Barbara] Univ Edinburgh, Sch Informat, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland; [Louis, Matthieu] Barcelona Inst Sci & Technol, Ctr Genom Regulat, Barcelona, Spain; [Louis, Matthieu] Univ Pompeu Fabra, Barcelona, Spain","Davies, A (reprint author), Univ Edinburgh, Sch Informat, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland.",B.Webb@ed.ac.uk,,,"UK Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council [EP/F500385/1, BB/F529254/1]; UK Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council; UK Medical Research Council; EU [618045]; Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation [BFU2011-483 26208]; European Molecular Biology Laboratory/Centre for Genomic Regulation Systems Biology Program","This work was funded by: Grants EP/F500385/1 and BB/F529254/1 for the University of Edinburgh School of Informatics Doctoral Training Centre in Neuroinformatics and Computational Neuroscience (http://www.anc.ed.ac.uk/dtc/) from the UK Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (www.epsrc.ac.uk), UK Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (http://www.bbsrc.ac.uk/) and the UK Medical Research Council (www.mrc.ac.uk) to AD; Project MINIMAL (618045) grant from the EU's Seventh Framework Programme for Research (ec.europa.eu/research/fp7) to BW, ML; and Grant BFU2011-483 26208 from the Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation (www.micinn.es), and the European Molecular Biology Laboratory/Centre for Genomic Regulation Systems Biology Program to ML.

Computational modeling provides tractable, quantitative methods to test hypotheses of redox mechanisms that may be simultaneously operative during signal transduction. The interleukin-4 (IL-4) pathway, which has previously been reported to induce reactive oxygen species and oxidation of PTP1B, may be controlled by several other putative mechanisms of redox regulation; widespread proteomic thiol oxidation observed via 2D redox differential gel electrophoresis upon IL-4 treatment suggests more than one redox-sensitive protein implicated in this pathway. Through computational modeling and a model selection strategy that relied on characteristic STAT6 phosphorylation dynamics of IL-4 signaling, we identified reversible protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) oxidation as the primary redox regulatory mechanism in the pathway. A systems-level model of IL-4 signaling was developed that integrates synchronous pan-PTP oxidation with ROS-independent mechanisms. The model quantitatively predicts the dynamics of IL-4 signaling over a broad range of new redox conditions, offers novel hypotheses about regulation of JAK/STAT signaling, and provides a framework for interrogating putative mechanisms involving receptor-initiated oxidation.","[Dwivedi, Gaurav; Gran, Margaret A.; Bagchi, Pritha; Kemp, Melissa L.] Georgia Inst Technol, Wallace H Coulter Dept Biomed Engn, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA; [Dwivedi, Gaurav; Gran, Margaret A.; Bagchi, Pritha; Kemp, Melissa L.] Emory Univ, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA; [Kemp, Melissa L.] Georgia Inst Technol, Parker H Petit Inst Bioengn & Biosci, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA","Dwivedi, G (reprint author), Georgia Inst Technol, Wallace H Coulter Dept Biomed Engn, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA.",melissa.kemp@bme.gatech.edu,,"Dwivedi, Gaurav/0000-0003-0681-0795",National Institutes of Health through the NIH Director's New Innovator Award Program [1DP2OD006483-01],"This work was funded by the National Institutes of Health through the NIH Director's New Innovator Award Program (https://commonfund.nih.gov/newinnovator/index), 1DP2OD006483-01 awarded to MLK.

Across vertebrate species, substitutions of amino acids at sites responsible for the specificity of antigen binding (ABS) are positively selected. This is attributed to pathogen-driven balancing selection, which is also thought to maintain the high polymorphism of MHC genes, and to cause the sharing of allelic lineages between species. However, the nature of this selection remains controversial. We used individual-based computer simulations to investigate the roles of two phenomena capable of maintaining MHC polymorphism: heterozygote advantage and host-pathogen arms race (Red Queen process). Our simulations revealed that levels of MHC polymorphism were high and driven mostly by the Red Queen process at a high pathogen mutation rate, but were low and driven mostly by heterozygote advantage when the pathogen mutation rate was low. We found that novel mutations at ABSs are strongly favored by the Red Queen process, but not by heterozygote advantage, regardless of the pathogen mutation rate. However, while the strong advantage of novel alleles increased the allele turnover rate, under a high pathogen mutation rate, allelic lineages persisted for a comparable length of time under Red Queen and under heterozygote advantage. Thus, when pathogens evolve quickly, the Red Queen is capable of explaining both positive selection and long coalescence times, but the tension between the novel allele advantage and persistence of alleles deserves further investigation.","[Ejsmond, Maciej Jan] Jagiellonian Univ, Inst Environm Sci, Krakow, Poland; [Ejsmond, Maciej Jan] Univ Ctr Svalbard, Dept Arctic Biol, Svalbard, Norway; [Radwan, Jacek] Adam Mickiewicz Univ, Evolutionary Biol Grp, Fac Biol, Poznan, Poland","Ejsmond, MJ (reprint author), Jagiellonian Univ, Inst Environm Sci, Krakow, Poland.",maciek.ejsmond@uj.edu.pl,"Ejsmond, Maciej/H-8751-2018","Ejsmond, Maciej/0000-0002-3598-4578; Radwan, Jacek/0000-0001-8503-5701",Polish Ministry of Science and Higher Education [IP2012 028572]; Jagiellonian University [DS/WBiNoZ/INoS 757/14],"The research was financed by the Polish Ministry of Science and Higher Education (grant no.

Here, we hypothesize that any system that accomplishes this feat will include three components: a representational language for characterizing modality-independent representations, a set of sensory-specific forward models for mapping from modality-independent representations to sensory signals, and an inference algorithm for inverting forward models-that is, an algorithm for using sensory signals to infer modality-independent representations. To evaluate this hypothesis, we instantiate it in the form of a computational model that learns object shape representations from visual and/or haptic signals. The model uses a probabilistic grammar to characterize modality-independent representations of object shape, uses a computer graphics toolkit and a human hand simulator to map from object representations to visual and haptic features, respectively, and uses a Bayesian inference algorithm to infer modality-independent object representations from visual and/or haptic signals. Simulation results show that the model infers identical object representations when an object is viewed, grasped, or both. That is, the model's percepts are modality invariant. We also report the results of an experiment in which different subjects rated the similarity of pairs of objects in different sensory conditions, and show that the model provides a very accurate account of subjects' ratings. Conceptually, this research significantly contributes to our understanding of modality invariance, an important type of perceptual constancy, by demonstrating how modality-independent representations can be acquired and used.

Instead of relying on an externally defined organization for biological functions, our approach connects biological functions together if they are performed by the same genes, as indicated in a compendium of gene annotation data from numerous different sources.

In biology, the resulting patterns are also subject to the influence of the systematic differences between the system's constituents (biological variability). This regulation of spatiotemporal patterns by biological variability is the topic of our review. We discuss several examples of correlations between cell properties and the self-organized spatiotemporal patterns, together with their relevance for biology. Our guiding, illustrative example will be spiral waves of cAMP in a colony of Dictyostelium discoideum cells. Analogous processes take place in diverse situations (such as cardiac tissue, where spiral waves occur in potentially fatal ventricular fibrillation) so a deeper understanding of this additional layer of self-organized pattern formation would be beneficial to a wide range of applications. One of the most striking differences between pattern-forming systems in physics or chemistry and those in biology is the potential importance of variability. In the former, system components are essentially identical with random fluctuations determining the details of the self-organization process and the resulting patterns. In biology, due to variability, the properties of potentially very few cells can have a driving influence on the resulting asymptotic collective state of the colony. Variability is one means of implementing a few-element control on the collective mode. Regulatory architectures, parameters of signaling cascades, and properties of structure formation processes can be ""reverse-engineered"" from observed spatiotemporal patterns, as different types of regulation and forms of interactions between the constituents can lead to markedly different correlations. The power of this biology-inspired view of pattern formation lies in building a bridge between two scales: the patterns as a collective state of a very large number of cells on the one hand, and the internal parameters of the single cells on the other.","[Grace, Miriam; Huett, Marc-Thorsten] Jacobs Univ Bremen, Sch Sci & Engn, D-28759 Bremen, Germany","Grace, M (reprint author), Jacobs Univ Bremen, Sch Sci & Engn, D-28759 Bremen, Germany.",m.huett@jacobs-university.de,,,"Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) [HU 937/4]; center for Mathematics, Modeling, and Computing (MAMOC) at Jacobs University Bremen","Our work on variability was funded by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG; grant HU 937/4) and the center for Mathematics, Modeling, and Computing (MAMOC) at Jacobs University Bremen.

We compared the genomic coverage, overlap of annotated metabolites, predictive ability for single gene essentiality with a selection of model parameters, and biomass production predictions in simulated nutrient-limited conditions. We have also compared pairwise gene knockout essentiality predictions for 10 of these models. We found that varying approaches to model scope and annotation reflected the involvement of multiple research groups in model development; that single-gene essentiality predictions were affected by simulated medium, objective function, and the reference list of essential genes; and that predictive ability for single-gene essentiality did not correlate well with predictive ability for our reference list of synthetic lethal gene interactions (R = 0.159). We conclude that the reconstruction of the yeast metabolic network is indeed gradually improving through the iterative process of model development, and there remains great opportunity for advancing our understanding of biology through continued efforts to reconstruct the full biochemical reaction network that constitutes yeast metabolism. Additionally, we suggest that there is opportunity for refining the process of deriving a metabolic model from a metabolic network reconstruction to facilitate mechanistic investigation and discovery.

A few examples of such amplifiers have been developed, but so far it is unclear how many such structures exist and how to construct them. Here, we show that almost any undirected random graph is an amplifier of selection for Birth-death updating, where an individual is selected to reproduce with probability proportional to its fitness and one of its neighbors is replaced by that offspring at random. If we instead focus on death-Birth updating, in which a random individual is removed and its neighbors compete for the empty spot, then the same ensemble of graphs consists of almost only suppressors of selection for which the fixation probability is decreased for advantageous mutants and increased for disadvantageous mutants.

However, animals and humans often take simple procedural behaviors, such as the ""win-stay, lose-switch"" strategy without explicit prediction of rewards or states. Here we consider another strategy, the finite state-based strategy, in which a subject selects an action depending on its discrete internal state and updates the state depending on the action chosen and the reward outcome. By analyzing choice behavior of rats in a free-choice task, we found that the finite state-based strategy fitted their behavioral choices more accurately than value-based and model-based strategies did. When fitted models were run autonomously with the same task, only the finite state-based strategy could reproduce the key feature of choice sequences. Analyses of neural activity recorded from the dorsolateral striatum (DLS), the dorsomedial striatum (DMS), and the ventral striatum (VS) identified significant fractions of neurons in all three subareas for which activities were correlated with individual states of the finite state-based strategy. The signal of internal states at the time of choice was found in DMS, and for clusters of states was found in VS. In addition, action values and state values of the value-based strategy were encoded in DMS and VS, respectively. These results suggest that both the value-based strategy and the finite state-based strategy are implemented in the striatum.","[Ito, Makoto; Doya, Kenji] Okinawa Inst Sci & Technol Grad Univ, Onna Son, Okinawa, Japan","Ito, M (reprint author), Okinawa Inst Sci & Technol Grad Univ, Onna Son, Okinawa, Japan.",ito@oist.jp,,"Ito, Makoto/0000-0003-2687-7655","MEXT KAKENHI [23120007, 26120729]; JSPS KAKENHI [25430017]","This work was supported by MEXT KAKENHI Grant Number 23120007(KD), MEXT KAKENHI Grant Number 26120729,(MI) and JSPS KAKENHI Grant Number 25430017(MI).

It remains uncertain, however, which particular activity rules are utilized by hippocampal neurons to induce LTP and LTD in behaving animals. Recent experiments in the dentate gyrus of freely moving rats revealed an unexpected pattern of LTP and LTD from high-frequency perforant path stimulation. While 400 Hz theta-burst stimulation (400-TBS) and 400 Hz delta-burst stimulation (400-DBS) elicited substantial LTP of the tetanized medial path input and, concurrently, LTD of the non-tetanized lateral path input, 100 Hz theta-burst stimulation (100-TBS, a normally efficient LTP protocol for in vitro preparations) produced only weak LTP and concurrent LTD. Here we show in a biophysically realistic compartmental granule cell model that this pattern of results can be accounted for by a voltage-based spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) rule combined with a relatively fast Bienenstock-Cooper-Munro (BCM)-like homeostatic metaplasticity rule, all on a background of ongoing spontaneous activity in the input fibers. Our results suggest that, at least for dentate granule cells, the interplay of STDP-BCM plasticity rules and ongoing pre-and postsynaptic background activity determines not only the degree of input-specific LTP elicited by various plasticity-inducing protocols, but also the degree of associated LTD in neighboring non-tetanized inputs, as generated by the ongoing constitutive activity at these synapses.","[Jedlicka, Peter] Goethe Univ Frankfurt, Inst Clin Neuroanat, Ctr Neurosci, D-60054 Frankfurt, Germany; [Benuskova, Lubica] Univ Otago, Dept Comp Sci, Dunedin, New Zealand; [Benuskova, Lubica; Abraham, Wickliffe C.] Univ Otago, Brain Hlth Res Ctr, Dunedin, New Zealand; [Benuskova, Lubica; Abraham, Wickliffe C.] Univ Otago, Brain Res New Zealand, Dunedin, New Zealand; [Abraham, Wickliffe C.] Univ Otago, Dept Psychol, Dunedin, New Zealand","Jedlicka, P (reprint author), Goethe Univ Frankfurt, Inst Clin Neuroanat, Ctr Neurosci, D-60054 Frankfurt, Germany.",jedlicka@em.uni-frankfurt.de; lubica@cs.otago.ac.nz,"Benuskova, Lubica/T-4415-2018","Jedlicka, Peter/0000-0001-6571-5742",faculty of medicine Goethe-University; BMBF [01GQ1203A],"The work was supported by a Young Investigators Grant (from the faculty of medicine Goethe-University to PJ, http://www.med.uni-frankfurt.de/Forschung/Forschungsfoerderung/Foerderprogramme/Nachwuchswissenschaftler/Gefoerderte_Nachwuchswissenschaftler.html) and by a BMBF grant (Germany-USA Collaboration in Computational Neuroscience to P.J., No. 01GQ1203A, http://www.bmbf.de/).

It has been proposed that the clocks of neighbouring cells are synchronised via inter-cellular Notch signalling, in order to overcome the effects of noisy gene expression. When Notch-dependent communication between cells fails, the clocks of individual cells operate erratically and lose synchrony over a period of about 5 to 8 segmentation clock cycles (2-3 hours in the zebrafish). Here, we quantitatively investigate the effects of stochasticity on cell synchrony, using mathematical modelling, to investigate the likely source of such noise. We find that variations in the transcription, translation and degradation rate of key Notch signalling regulators do not explain the in vivo kinetics of desynchronisation. Rather, the analysis predicts that clock desynchronisation, in the absence of Notch signalling, is due to the stochastic dissociation of Her1/7 repressor proteins from the oscillating her1/7 autorepressed target genes. Using in situ hybridisation to visualise sites of active her1 transcription, we measure an average delay of approximately three minutes between the times of activation of the two her1 alleles in a cell. Our model shows that such a delay is sufficient to explain the in vivo rate of clock desynchronisation in Notch pathway mutant embryos and also that Notch-mediated synchronisation is sufficient to overcome this stochastic variation. This suggests that the stochastic nature of repressor/DNA dissociation is the major source of noise in the segmentation clock.","[Jenkins, Robert P.; Sahai, Erik] Francis Crick Inst, Lincolns Inn Fields Lab, Tumour Cell Biol Lab, London, England; [Jenkins, Robert P.; Hanisch, Anja; Soza-Ried, Cristian; Lewis, Julian] Francis Crick Inst, Lincolns Inn Fields Lab, Vertebrate Dev Lab, London, England","Jenkins, RP (reprint author), Francis Crick Inst, Lincolns Inn Fields Lab, Tumour Cell Biol Lab, London, England.",robert.jenkins@crick.ac.uk; erik.sahai@crick.ac.uk,,"Sahai, Erik/0000-0002-3932-5086",Cancer Research UK; European Molecular Biology Organization (EMBO) Longterm Fellowship [ALTF-44-2007]; Cancer Research UK [15154]; The Francis Crick Institute [10144],"Funding from Cancer Research UK (www.cancerresearchuk.org) and a European Molecular Biology Organization (EMBO) Longterm Fellowship (www.embo.org), grant number ALTF-44-2007, for AH.

Here, we develop and analyze a dynamical model of CRISPR-mediated prokaryote-phage coevolution that incorporates classical CRISPR kinetics along with the recently discovered infection-induced activation and autoimmunity side effects. Our analyses reveal two striking characteristics of the CRISPR defense strategy: that both restriction and abortive infections operate during coevolution with phages, driving phages to much lower densities than possible with restriction alone, and that CRISPR maintenance is determined by a key dimensionless combination of parameters, which upper bounds the activation level of CRISPRs in uninfected populations. We contrast these qualitative observations with experimental data on CRISPR kinetics, which offer insight into the spacer deletion mechanism and the observed low CRISPR prevalence in clinical isolates.

Where genetic change and disease transmission occur on comparable timescales additional information can be inferred via the joint analysis of such genetic sequence data and epidemiological observations based on clinical symptoms and diagnostic tests. Although recently introduced approaches represent substantial progress, for computational reasons they approximate genuine joint inference of disease dynamics and genetic change in the pathogen population, capturing partially the joint epidemiological-evolutionary dynamics. Improved methods are needed to fully integrate such genetic data with epidemiological observations, for achieving a more robust inference of the transmission tree and other key epidemiological parameters such as latent periods. Here, building on current literature, a novel Bayesian framework is proposed that infers simultaneously and explicitly the transmission tree and unobserved transmitted pathogen sequences. Our framework facilitates the use of realistic likelihood functions and enables systematic and genuine joint inference of the epidemiological-evolutionary process from partially observed outbreaks. Using simulated data it is shown that this approach is able to infer accurately joint epidemiological-evolutionary dynamics, even when pathogen sequences and epidemiological data are incomplete, and when sequences are available for only a fraction of exposures. These results also characterise and quantify the value of incomplete and partial sequence data, which has important implications for sampling design, and demonstrate the abilities of the introduced method to identify multiple clusters within an outbreak. The framework is used to analyse an outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease in the UK, enhancing current understanding of its transmission dynamics and evolutionary process.","[Lau, Max S.

We show that each model reflects a different set of constraints acting either on the normal or tumor genome, and we identify the specific genome features that most contribute to these constraints. Importantly, we show that the somatic mutation model carries independent functional information that can be used to narrow down the non-coding regions that may be relevant to cancer progression.

Several drug-resistant mutations affecting the catalytic domain of Abl and other tyrosine kinases are now known. But, despite their importance and the adverse effect that they have on the prognosis of the cancer patients harboring them, the molecular mechanism of these mutations is still debated. Here by using long molecular dynamics simulations and large-scale free energy calculations complemented by in vitro mutagenesis and microcalorimetry experiments, we model the effect of several widespread drug-resistant mutations of Abl. By comparing the conformational free energy landscape of the mutants with those of the wild-type tyrosine kinases we clarify their mode of action.

The development of better therapeutics would greatly benefit from improved understanding of the mechanisms associated with MTB responses to different genetic and environmental perturbations. Therefore, we expanded a genome-scale regulatory- metabolic model for MTB using the Probabilistic Regulation of Metabolism (PROM) framework. Our model, MTBPROM2.0, represents a substantial knowledge base update and extension of simulation capability. We incorporated a recent ChIP-seq based binding network of 2555 interactions linking to 104 transcription factors (TFs) (representing a 3.5-fold expansion of TF coverage). We integrated this expanded regulatory network with a refined genome-scale metabolic model that can correctly predict growth viability over 69 source metabolite conditions and predict metabolic gene essentiality more accurately than the original model. We used MTBPROM2.0 to simulate the metabolic consequences of knocking out and overexpressing each of the 104 TFs in the model. MTBPROM2.0 improves performance of knockout growth defect predictions compared to the original PROM MTB model, and it can successfully predict growth defects associated with TF overexpression. Moreover, condition-specific models of MTBPROM2.0 successfully predicted synergistic growth consequences of overexpressing the TF whiB4 in the presence of two standard anti-TB drugs. MTBPROM2.0 can screen in silico condition-specific transcription factor perturbations to generate putative targets of interest that can help prioritize future experiments for therapeutic development efforts.","[Ma, Shuyi; Price, Nathan D.] Univ Illinois, Dept Biomol & Chem Engn, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Ma, Shuyi; Zhou, Suk-Lin; Price, Nathan D.] Inst Syst Biol, Seattle, WA USA; [Ma, Shuyi; Minch, Kyle J.; Rustad, Tige R.; Hobbs, Samuel; Zhou, Suk-Lin; Sherman, David R.] Seattle Biomed Res Inst, Ctr Infect Dis Res, Seattle, WA 98109 USA; [Sherman, David R.] Univ Washington, Dept Global Hlth, Interdisciplinary Program Pathobiol, Seattle, WA 98195 USA","Ma, SY (reprint author), Univ Illinois, Dept Biomol & Chem Engn, Urbana, IL 61801 USA.",nprice@systemsbiology.org,,"Hobbs, Samuel/0000-0002-4282-8813; Ma, Shuyi/0000-0003-0783-1328","Camille Dreyfus Teacher-Scholar Award Program; Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation; National Institutes of Health Center for Systems Biology [2P50GM076547]; National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Dept. of Health and Human Services [HHSN272200800059C, N01-AI-15447, 1U19AI106761]; NSF [DGE-1144245]","This project has been funded with the Camille Dreyfus Teacher-Scholar Award Program (http://www.dreyfus.org/awards/camille_dreyfus_teacher_award.shtml) (NDP), the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation (http://www.gatesfoundation.org/) (DRS), federal funds from the National Institutes of Health Center for Systems Biology/2P50GM076547 (NDP), the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Dept. of Health and Human Services under contract HHSN272200800059C, contract N01-AI-15447, and grant 1U19AI106761, and the NSF Graduate Research Fellowship DGE-1144245 (SM).

However, in others tasks, for example those requiring memory or mental calculation, subjects often give estimations with large deviations from factual values. Allowing members of the group to communicate their estimations has the additional perverse effect of shifting individual estimations even closer to the biased collective estimation. Here we show that this negative effect of social interactions can be turned into a method to improve collective estimations. We first obtained a statistical model of how humans change their estimation when receiving the estimates made by other individuals. We confirmed using existing experimental data its prediction that individuals use the weighted geometric mean of private and social estimations. We then used this result and the fact that each individual uses a different value of the social weight to devise a method that extracts the subgroups resisting social influence. We found that these subgroups of individuals resisting social influence can make very large improvements in group estimations. This is in contrast to methods using the confidence that each individual declares, for which we find no improvement in group estimations. Also, our proposed method does not need to use historical data to weight individuals by performance. These results show the benefits of using the individual characteristics of the members in a group to better extract collective wisdom.","[Madirolas, Gabriel; de Polavieja, Gonzalo G.] CSIC, Inst Cajal, E-28002 Madrid, Spain; [Madirolas, Gabriel; de Polavieja, Gonzalo G.] Champalimaud Ctr Unknown, Champalimaud Neurosci Programme, Lisbon, Portugal","Madirolas, G (reprint author), CSIC, Inst Cajal, E-28002 Madrid, Spain.",gonzalo.polavieja@neuro.fchampalimaud.org,,"de Polavieja, Gonzalo/0000-0001-5359-3426; Madirolas, Gabriel/0000-0002-4526-4507",Spanish Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad [BFU2009-09967]; Champalimaud Neuroscience Programme (Portugal),"We acknowledge funding from Spanish Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad (BFU2009-09967) to G.G.d.P including a doctoral contract to G.

One intriguing, but untested, hypothesis posits a role for ongoing activity fluctuations in neurons of central action selection circuits that drive animal behavior from moment to moment. To examine how fluctuating activity can contribute to action timing, we paired high-resolution measurements of freely walking Drosophila melanogaster with data-driven neural network modeling and dynamical systems analysis. We generated fluctuation-driven network models whose outputs-locomotor bouts-matched those measured from sensory-deprived Drosophila. From these models, we identified those that could also reproduce a second, unrelated dataset: the complex time-course of odor-evoked walking for genetically diverse Drosophila strains. Dynamical models that best reproduced both Drosophila basal and odor-evoked locomotor patterns exhibited specific characteristics. First, ongoing fluctuations were required. In a stochastic resonance-like manner, these fluctuations allowed neural activity to escape stable equilibria and to exceed a threshold for locomotion. Second, odor-induced shifts of equilibria in these models caused a depression in locomotor frequency following olfactory stimulation. Our models predict that activity fluctuations in action selection circuits cause behavioral output to more closely match sensory drive and may therefore enhance navigation in complex sensory environments. Together these data reveal how simple neural dynamics, when coupled with activity fluctuations, can give rise to complex patterns of animal behavior.","[Maesani, Andrea; Ramdya, Pavan; Floreano, Dario] Ecole Polytech Fed Lausanne, Inst Microengn, Lausanne, Switzerland; [Ramdya, Pavan; Cruchet, Steeve; Benton, Richard] Univ Lausanne, Fac Biol & Med, Ctr Integrat Genom, Lausanne, Switzerland; [Gustafson, Kyle] Ecole Polytech Fed Lausanne, Sch Life Sci, Inst Bioengn, Lausanne, Switzerland","Maesani, A (reprint author), Ecole Polytech Fed Lausanne, Inst Microengn, Lausanne, Switzerland.",ramdya@caltech.edu,,"Gustafson, Kyle/0000-0002-1903-9015","Human Frontier Science Program [LT000057/2009]; Swiss National Science Foundation [200021_127143, P300P3_158511, 31003A_140869]; European Research Council [205202, 615094]","This work was funded by: Human Frontier Science Program http://www.hfsp.org/Grant Number: LT000057/2009 (PR); Swiss National Science Foundation http://www.snf.ch/en/Pages/default.aspx Grant Number: 200021_127143 (DF), Grant Number: P300P3_158511 (PR), Grant Number: 31003A_140869 (RB); and European Research Council http://erc.europa.eu/Grant Number: 205202 (RB), Grant Number: 615094 (RB).

While it is unknown how the brain learns to follow and predict the dynamics of objects, it is known that this process of state estimation can be learned purely from the statistics of noisy observations. When the dynamics are simply linear with additive Gaussian noise, the optimal solution is the well known Kalman filter (KF), the parameters of which can be learned via latent-variable density estimation (the EM algorithm). The brain does not, however, directly manipulate matrices and vectors, but instead appears to represent probability distributions with the firing rates of population of neurons, ""probabilistic population codes."" We show that a recurrent neural network-a modified form of an exponential family harmonium (EFH)-that takes a linear probabilistic population code as input can learn, without supervision, to estimate the state of a linear dynamical system. After observing a series of population responses (spike counts) to the position of a moving object, the network learns to represent the velocity of the object and forms nearly optimal predictions about the position at the next time-step. This result builds on our previous work showing that a similar network can learn to perform multisensory integration and coordinate transformations for static stimuli. The receptive fields of the trained network also make qualitative predictions about the developing and learning brain: tuning gradually emerges for higher-order dynamical states not explicitly present in the inputs, appearing as delayed tuning for the lower-order states.","[Makin, Joseph G.; Dichter, Benjamin K.; Sabes, Philip N.] Univ Calif San Francisco, Ctr Integrat Neurosci, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; [Makin, Joseph G.; Sabes, Philip N.] Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Physiol, San Francisco, CA USA; [Dichter, Benjamin K.; Sabes, Philip N.] Univ Calif San Francisco, UC Berkeley UCSF Grad Program Bioengn, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA","Makin, JG (reprint author), Univ Calif San Francisco, Ctr Integrat Neurosci, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA.",makin@phy.ucsf.edu,,"Dichter, Benjamin/0000-0001-5725-6910","Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency [N66001-10-C-2010, W911NF-14-2-0043]; National Institutes of Health Vision Training Grant [5T32EY007120-22]; UCSF Wheeler Center for the Neurobiology of Addiction","This work was funded by: Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (N66001-10-C-2010, W911NF-14-2-0043); National Institutes of Health Vision Training Grant (5T32EY007120-22); and UCSF Wheeler Center for the Neurobiology of Addiction (http://physio.ucsf.edu/WheelerCenter/Center/).

In this paper, we show that the movement time of behaving monkeys performing a decision-making task is correlated with decision difficulty and that the activity of a population of neurons in ventral Premotor cortex correlates with the movement time. Moreover, we found another population of neurons that encodes the discriminability of the stimulus, thereby supplying another source of information about the difficulty of the decision. The activity of neurons encoding the difficulty can be produced by very different computations. Therefore, we show that decision difficulty can be encoded through three different mechanisms: 1. Switch time coding, 2. rate coding and 3. binary coding.

In cancer cells, excessive phosphorylation and activation of the Akt pathway is responsible for cell survival advantages. In normal cells, serum stimulation causes brief peaks of extremely high Akt phosphorylation before reaching a moderate steady-state. Previous modeling assumed this peak and decline behavior (i. e., ""overshoot"") was due to receptor internalization. In this work, we modeled the dynamics of the overshoot as a tool for gaining insight into Akt pathway function. We built an ordinary differential equation (ODE) model describing pathway activation immediately upstream of Akt phosphorylation at Thr308 (Aktp308). The model was fit to experimental measurements of Aktp308, total Akt, and phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-trisphosphate (PIP3), from mouse embryonic fibroblasts with serum stimulation. The canonical Akt activation model (the null hypothesis) was unable to recapitulate the observed delay between the peak of PIP3 (at 2 minutes), and the peak of Aktp308 (at 30-60 minutes). From this we conclude that the peak and decline behavior of Aktp308 is not caused by PIP3 dynamics. Models for alternative hypotheses were constructed by allowing an arbitrary dynamic curve to perturb each of 5 steps of the pathway. All 5 of the alternative models could reproduce the observed delay. To distinguish among the alternatives, simulations suggested which species and timepoints would show strong differences. Time-series experiments with membrane fractionation and PI3K inhibition were performed, and incompatible hypotheses were excluded. We conclude that the peak and decline behavior of Aktp308 is caused by a non-canonical effect that retains Akt at the membrane, and not by receptor internalization. Furthermore, we provide a novel spline-based method for simulating the network implications of an unknown effect, and we demonstrate a process of hypothesis management for guiding efficient experiments.","[Nim, Tri Hieu; White, Jacob K.; Tucker-Kellogg, Lisa] Singapore MIT Alliance, Computat Syst Biol Programme, Singapore, Singapore; [Nim, Tri Hieu; Clement, Marie-Veronique] Syst Biol Inst, Clayton, Vic, Australia; [Nim, Tri Hieu] Monash Univ, Australian Regenerat Med Inst, Clayton, Vic, Australia; [Nim, Tri Hieu] Monash Univ, Fac IT, Clayton, Vic, Australia; [Luo, Le] Natl Univ Singapore, Yong Loo Lin Sch Med, Dept Biochem, Singapore 117595, Singapore; [White, Jacob K.] MIT, Dept Elect Engn & Comp Sci, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Clement, Marie-Veronique] Natl Univ Singapore, Grad Sch Integrat Sci & Engn, Singapore 117548, Singapore; [Tucker-Kellogg, Lisa] Natl Univ Singapore, Duke NUS Grad Med Sch Singapore, Singapore 117548, Singapore","Nim, TH (reprint author), Singapore MIT Alliance, Computat Syst Biol Programme, Singapore, Singapore.",bchmvc@nus.edu.sg; lisa.tucker-kellogg@duke-nus.edu.sg,"Tucker-Kellogg, L/G-3376-2012","Tucker-Kellogg, L/0000-0002-1301-7069",Singapore-MIT Alliance [C-382-641-004-091]; BMRC [09/1/21/19/603]; Duke-NUS; Richard Pratt Fellowship in Prostate Cancer Research,"This work was supported by Singapore-MIT Alliance grant C-382-641-004-091 to LTK and JKW, by BMRC grant 09/1/21/19/603 to MVC, by Duke-NUS block funding to LTK, and by a Richard Pratt Fellowship in Prostate Cancer Research to THN.

Here we formally show that for ""stratified"" multiple hypothesis testing problems-that is, those in which statistical tests can be partitioned naturally-controlling the local False Discovery Rate (lFDR) per stratum, or partition, yields the most predictions across the data at any given threshold on the FDR or E-value over all strata combined. For the important problem of protein domain prediction, a key step in characterizing protein structure, function and evolution, we show that stratifying statistical tests by domain family yields excellent results. We develop the first FDR-estimating algorithms for domain prediction, and evaluate how well thresholds based on q-values, E-values and lFDRs perform in domain prediction using five complementary approaches for estimating empirical FDRs in this context. We show that stratified q-value thresholds substantially outperform E-values. Contradicting our theoretical results, q-values also outperform lFDRs; however, our tests reveal a small but coherent subset of domain families, biased towards models for specific repetitive patterns, for which weaknesses in random sequence models yield notably inaccurate statistical significance measures. Usage of lFDR thresholds outperform q-values for the remaining families, which have as-expected noise, suggesting that further improvements in domain predictions can be achieved with improved modeling of random sequences. Overall, our theoretical and empirical findings suggest that the use of stratified q-values and lFDRs could result in improvements in a host of structured multiple hypothesis testing problems arising in bioinformatics, including genome-wide association studies, orthology prediction, and motif scanning.","[Ochoa, Alejandro; Storey, John D.] Princeton Univ, Dept Mol Biol, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [Ochoa, Alejandro; Storey, John D.; Singh, Mona] Princeton Univ, Lewis Sigler Inst Integrat Genom, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [Ochoa, Alejandro; Storey, John D.] Princeton Univ, Ctr Stat & Machine Learning, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [Llinas, Manuel] Penn State Univ, Dept Biochem & Mol Bio, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; [Llinas, Manuel] Penn State Univ, Huck Inst Life Sci, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; [Singh, Mona] Princeton Univ, Dept Comp Sci, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA","Ochoa, A (reprint author), Princeton Univ, Dept Mol Biol, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA.",mona@cs.princeton.edu,"Ochoa, Alejandro/H-4943-2019","Ochoa, Alejandro/0000-0003-4928-3403; Storey, John/0000-0001-5992-402X","National Science Foundation [DGE 0646086, ABI 1062371]; National Institutes of Health [1 R21-AI085415, R01-GM076275, R01-HG002913, P50 GM071508]","This work was supported by the National Science Foundation [Graduate Research Fellowship DGE 0646086 to AO, ABI 1062371 to MS, http://www.nsf.gov/]; and the National Institutes of Health [1 R21-AI085415 to MS and ML, R01-GM076275 to MS, R01-HG002913 to JDS, Center of Excellence P50 GM071508 to the Lewis-Sigler Institute, http://www.nih.gov/].

We combine neuromechanistic modeling and psychoacoustic experiments to study these persistent alternations and to characterize the effects of manipulating stimulus parameters. Unlike many phenomenological models with abstract, percept-specific competition and fixed inputs, our network model comprises neuronal units with sensory feature dependent inputs that mimic the pulsatile-like A1 responses to tones in the ABA-triplets. It embodies a neuronal computation for percept competition thought to occur beyond primary auditory cortex (A1). Mutual inhibition, adaptation and noise are implemented. We include slow NDMA recurrent excitation for local temporal memory that enables linkage across sound gaps from one triplet to the next. Percepts in our model are identified in the firing patterns of the neuronal units. We predict with the model that manipulations of the frequency difference between tones A and B should affect the dominance durations of the stronger percept, the one dominant a larger fraction of time, more than those of the weaker percept-a property that has been previously established and generalized across several visual bistable paradigms. We confirm the qualitative prediction with our psychoacoustic experiments and use the behavioral data to further constrain and improve the model, achieving quantitative agreement between experimental and modeling results. Our work and model provide a platform that can be extended to consider other stimulus conditions, including the effects of context and volition.","[Rankin, James; Rinzel, John] NYU, Ctr Neural Sci, New York, NY 10003 USA; [Sussman, Elyse] Albert Einstein Coll Med, Dominick P Purpura Dept Neurosci, Bronx, NY 10467 USA; [Sussman, Elyse] Albert Einstein Coll Med, Dept Otorhinolaryngol HNS, Bronx, NY 10467 USA; [Rinzel, John] NYU, Courant Inst Math Sci, New York, NY USA","Rankin, J (reprint author), NYU, Ctr Neural Sci, New York, NY 10003 USA.",james.rankin@nyu.edu,,"Rankin, James/0000-0002-8850-6027",Swartz Foundation; NIH [DC004263]; NIH K-18 award [K18 DC011602],"JRa is supported on a postdoc fellowship from the Swartz Foundation.

We prove that two natural principles, local exhaustivity and parsimony of representation, would constrain the orientation and spatial frequency maps to display a very specific pinwheel-dipole singularity. This is particularly interesting since recent experimental evidences show a dipolar structures of the spatial frequency map co-localized with pinwheels in cat. These structures have important properties on information processing capabilities. In particular, we show using a computational model of visual information processing that this architecture allows a trade-off in the local detection of orientation and spatial frequency, but this property occurs for spatial frequency selectivity sharper than reported in the literature. We validated this sharpening on high-resolution optical imaging experimental data.

These spontaneous remodeling processes can give rise to skewed and stable synaptic size distributions, underlie scaling of these distributions and drive changes in glutamatergic synapse size ""configurations"". Where inhibitory synapses are concerned, however, little is known on spontaneous remodeling dynamics, their statistics, their activity dependence or their long-term consequences. Here we followed individual inhibitory synapses for days, and analyzed their size remodeling dynamics within the statistical framework previously developed for glutamatergic synapses. Similar to glutamatergic synapses, size distributions of inhibitory synapses were skewed and stable; at the same time, however, sizes of individual synapses changed considerably, leading to gradual changes in synaptic size configurations. The suppression of network activity only transiently affected spontaneous remodeling dynamics, did not affect synaptic size configuration change rates and was not followed by the scaling of inhibitory synapse size distributions. Comparisons with glutamatergic synapses within the same dendrites revealed a degree of coupling between nearby inhibitory and excitatory synapse remodeling, but also revealed that inhibitory synapse size configurations changed at considerably slower rates than those of their glutamatergic neighbors. These findings point to quantitative differences in spontaneous remodeling dynamics of inhibitory and excitatory synapses but also reveal deep qualitative similarities in the processes that control their sizes and govern their remodeling dynamics.","[Rubinski, Anna; Ziv, Noam E.] Technion Israel Inst Technol, Rappaport Fac Med, Network Biol Res Labs, Haifa, Israel","Rubinski, A (reprint author), Technion Israel Inst Technol, Rappaport Fac Med, Network Biol Res Labs, Haifa, Israel.",noamz@netvision.net.il,,"Ziv, Noam/0000-0001-9197-326X",DFG German-Israeli Foundation DIP [RO3971/1-1]; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft [SFB 1089]; Israel Science Foundation [1175/14]; Allen and Jewel Prince Center for Neurodegenerative Disorders of the Brain,"This work was funded by DFG German-Israeli Foundation DIP (RO3971/1-1) to NEZ. http://www.dfg.de/en/research_funding/announcements_proposals/2014/info_wissenschaft_14_56/index.html; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (SFB 1089 - Synaptic Micronetworks in Health and Disease) to NEZ. http://sfb1089.de/; The Israel Science Foundation (1175/14) to NEZ. http://www.isf.org.il/english/default.asp; and The Allen and Jewel Prince Center for Neurodegenerative Disorders of the Brain to NEZ.

Dynamical optimization models assuming that neurons coordinate their stimulus preferences throughout cortical circuits linking millions of cells specifically predict these invariants. This might indicate that V1's intrinsic connectome and its functional architecture adhere to a single optimization principle with high precision and robustness. To validate this hypothesis, it is critical to closely examine the quantitative predictions of alternative candidate theories. Random feedforward wiring within the retino-cortical pathway represents a conceptually appealing alternative to dynamical circuit optimization because random dimension-expanding projections are believed to generically exhibit computationally favorable properties for stimulus representations. Here, we ask whether the quantitative invariants of V1 architecture can be explained as a generic emergent property of random wiring. We generalize and examine the stochastic wiring model proposed by Ringach and coworkers, in which iso-orientation domains in the visual cortex arise through random feedforward connections between semi-regular mosaics of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) and visual cortical neurons. We derive closed-form expressions for cortical receptive fields and domain layouts predicted by the model for perfectly hexagonal RGC mosaics. Including spatial disorder in the RGC positions considerably changes the domain layout properties as a function of disorder parameters such as position scatter and its correlations across the retina. However, independent of parameter choice, we find that the model predictions substantially deviate from the layout laws of iso-orientation domains observed experimentally. Considering random wiring with the currently most realistic model of RGC mosaic layouts, a pairwise interacting point process, the predicted layouts remain distinct from experimental observations and resemble Gaussian random fields. We conclude that V1 layout invariants are specific quantitative signatures of visual cortical optimization, which cannot be explained by generic random feedforward-wiring models.","[Schottdorf, Manuel; Keil, Wolfgang; Wolf, Fred] Max Planck Inst Dynam & Self Org, Gottingen, Germany; [Schottdorf, Manuel; Keil, Wolfgang; Wolf, Fred] Bernstein Ctr Computat Neurosci, Gottingen, Germany; [Schottdorf, Manuel; Keil, Wolfgang; Wolf, Fred] Bernstein Focus Neurotechnol, Gottingen, Germany; [Schottdorf, Manuel; Keil, Wolfgang; Wolf, Fred] Univ Gottingen, Fac Phys, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany; [Schottdorf, Manuel] Univ Wurzburg, Inst Theoret Phys, D-97070 Wurzburg, Germany; [Keil, Wolfgang] Rockefeller Univ, Ctr Studies Phys & Biol, New York, NY 10021 USA; [Coppola, David] Randolph Macon Coll, Dept Biol, Ashland, VA 23005 USA; [White, Leonard E.] Duke Univ, Duke Inst Brain Sci, Dept Orthopaed Surg, Durham, NC USA; [Wolf, Fred] Kavli Inst Theoret Phys, Santa Barbara, CA USA","Schottdorf, M (reprint author), Max Planck Inst Dynam & Self Org, Gottingen, Germany.",wkeil@rockefeller.edu,"889, CRC/L-1607-2018","889, CRC/0000-0002-6678-3138; Schottdorf, Manuel/0000-0002-5468-4255","Human Frontier Science Program; German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF); German Research Foundation (DFG); Max Planck Society (MPG); Volkswagen Foundation [CRC 889, BFL 01GQ0921, 01GQ0922, BCCN 01GQ0430, 01GQ1005B, 01GQ07113, BFNT 01GQ0811]; National Science Foundation [NSF PHY11-25915]; Boehringer Ingelheim","This work was supported by the Human Frontier Science Program, the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF), the German Research Foundation (DFG), the Max Planck Society (MPG), and the Volkswagen Foundation.

However, existing techniques to construct co-expression networks require some critical prior information such as predefined number of clusters, numerical thresholds for defining co-expression/interaction, or do not naturally reproduce the hallmarks of complex systems such as the scale-free degree distribution of small-worldness. Previously, a graph filtering technique called Planar Maximally Filtered Graph (PMFG) has been applied to many real-world data sets such as financial stock prices and gene expression to extract meaningful and relevant interactions. However, PMFG is not suitable for large-scale genomic data due to several drawbacks, such as the high computation complexity O(|V|(3)), the presence of false-positives due to the maximal planarity constraint, and the inadequacy of the clustering framework. Here, we developed a new co-expression network analysis framework called Multiscale Embedded Gene Co-expression Network Analysis (MEGENA) by: i) introducing quality control of coexpression similarities, ii) parallelizing embedded network construction, and iii) developing a novel clustering technique to identify multi-scale clustering structures in Planar Filtered Networks (PFNs). We applied MEGENA to a series of simulated data and the gene expression data in breast carcinoma and lung adenocarcinoma from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). MEGENA showed improved performance over well-established clustering methods and co-expression network construction approaches.

Despite this importance, few studies have investigated how clock perturbations affect stochastic noise-even as increasing numbers of high-throughput screens categorize how gene knockdowns or small molecules can change clock period and amplitude. This absence is likely due to the difficulty associated with measuring cell-autonomous stochastic noise directly, which currently requires the careful collection and processing of single-cell data. In this study, we show that the damping rate of population-level bioluminescence recordings can serve as an accurate measure of overall stochastic noise, and one that can be applied to future and existing high-throughput circadian screens. Using cell-autonomous fibroblast data, we first show directly that higher noise at the single-cell results in faster damping at the population level. Next, we show that the damping rate of cultured cells can be changed in a dose-dependent fashion by small molecule modulators, and confirm that such a change can be explained by single-cell noise using a mathematical model. We further demonstrate the insights that can be gained by applying our method to a genome-wide siRNA screen, revealing that stochastic noise is altered independently from period, amplitude, and phase. Finally, we hypothesize that the unperturbed clock is highly optimized for robust rhythms, as very few gene perturbations are capable of simultaneously increasing amplitude and lowering stochastic noise. Ultimately, this study demonstrates the importance of considering the effect of circadian perturbations on stochastic noise, particularly with regard to the development of small-molecule circadian therapeutics.","[St John, Peter C.; Doyle, Francis J., III] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Chem Engn, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA; [St John, Peter C.] Natl Renewable Energy Lab, Biosci Ctr, Golden, CO USA; [Doyle, Francis J., III] Harvard Univ, Paulson Sch Engn & Appl Sci, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA","St John, PC (reprint author), Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Chem Engn, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA.",frank_doyle@seas.harvard.edu,,"St. John, Peter/0000-0002-7928-3722",National Institutes of Health/National Institute of General Medical Sciences [1R01GM096873-01]; Institute for Collaborative Biotechnologies from the U.S. Army Research Office [W911NF-09-0001],"This work was supported by the National Institutes of Health/National Institute of General Medical Sciences (nih.gov) under award number 1R01GM096873-01 to FJD, and by the Institute for Collaborative Biotechnologies (icb.ucsb.edu) through grant W911NF-09-0001 to FJD from the U.S. Army Research Office.

Whereas driver mutations in protein-coding genes can be distinguished from passenger mutations based on their recurrence, non-coding mutations are usually not recurrent at the same position. Therefore, it is still unclear how to identify cis-regulatory driver mutations, particularly when chromatin data from the same patient is not available, thus relying only on sequence and expression information. Here we use machine-learning methods to predict functional regulatory regions using sequence information alone, and compare the predicted activity of the mutated region with the reference sequence. This way we define the Predicted Regulatory Impact of a Mutation in an Enhancer (PRIME). We find that the recently identified driver mutation in the TAL1 enhancer has a high PRIME score, representing a ""gain-of-target"" for MYB, whereas the highly recurrent TERT promoter mutation has a surprisingly low PRIME score. We trained Random Forest models for 45 cancer-related transcription factors, and used these to score variations in the HeLa genome and somatic mutations across more than five hundred cancer genomes. Each model predicts only a small fraction of non-coding mutations with a potential impact on the function of the encompassing regulatory region. Nevertheless, as these few candidate driver mutations are often linked to gains in chromatin activity and gene expression, they may contribute to the oncogenic program by altering the expression levels of specific oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes.","[Svetlichnyy, Dmitry; Imrichova, Hana; Atak, Zeynep Kalender; Aerts, Stein] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Ctr Human Genet, Lab Computat Biol, Leuven, Belgium; [Fiers, Mark] VIB, Ctr Biol Dis, Leuven, Belgium","Svetlichnyy, D (reprint author), Katholieke Univ Leuven, Ctr Human Genet, Lab Computat Biol, Leuven, Belgium.",stein.aerts@med.kuleuven.be,"Aerts, Stein/A-1100-2009; Imrichova, Hana/H-1739-2016","Aerts, Stein/0000-0002-8006-0315; Imrichova, Hana/0000-0003-0385-1823; Kalender Atak, Zeynep/0000-0003-4761-8169",FWO [G.0791.14]; Special Research Fund (BOF) KU Leuven [PF/10/016]; Foundation Against Cancer [2012-F2]; IWT PhD fellowship; Kom op Tegen Kanker (Stand up to Cancer); Flemish cancer society post-doctoral fellowship,"This work was funded by FWO (www.fwo.be) [G.0791.14 to S.A.]; Special Research Fund (BOF) KU Leuven (http://www.kuleuven.be/research/funding) [PF/10/016 to S.A.]; Foundation Against Cancer (http://www.cancer.be) [2012-F2 to S.A.].

We introduce a model-free method, based on embedding theorems in nonlinear state-space reconstruction, that permits a simultaneous characterization of complexity in local dynamics, directed interactions between brain areas, and how the complexity is produced by the interactions. We demonstrate this method in large-scale electrophysiological recordings from awake and anesthetized monkeys. The cross-embedding method captures structured interaction underlying cortex-wide dynamics that may be missed by conventional correlation- based analysis, demonstrating a critical role of time-series analysis in characterizing brain state. The method reveals a consciousness-related hierarchy of cortical areas, where dynamical complexity increases along with cross-area information flow.

Contraction is initiated when calcium binds to troponin, which changes conformation and displaces tropomyosin, a filamentous protein that wraps around the actin filament, thereby exposing myosin binding sites on actin. Myosin motors interact with each other indirectly via tropomyosin, since myosin binding to actin locally displaces tropomyosin and thereby facilitates binding of nearby myosin. Defining and modeling this local coupling between myosin motors is an open problem in muscle modeling and, more broadly, a requirement to understanding the connection between muscle contraction at the molecular and macro scale. It is challenging to directly observe this coupling, and such measurements have only recently been made. Analysis of these data suggests that two myosin heads are required to activate the thin filament. This result contrasts with a theoretical model, which reproduces several indirect measurements of coupling between myosin, that assumes a single myosin head can activate the thin filament. To understand this apparent discrepancy, we incorporated the model into stochastic simulations of the experiments, which generated simulated data that were then analyzed identically to the experimental measurements. By varying a single parameter, good agreement between simulation and experiment was established. The conclusion that two myosin molecules are required to activate the thin filament arises from an assumption, made during data analysis, that the intensity of the fluorescent tags attached to myosin varies depending on experimental condition. We provide an alternative explanation that reconciles theory and experiment without assuming that the intensity of the fluorescent tags varies.","[Walcott, Sam] Univ Calif Davis, Math, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Kad, Neil M.] Univ Kent, Sch Biosci, Canterbury, Kent, England","Walcott, S (reprint author), Univ Calif Davis, Math, Davis, CA 95616 USA.",swalcott@math.ucdavis.edu,,"Kad, Neil/0000-0002-3491-8595; Walcott, Sam/0000-0002-8871-6964","NSF [DMS-1413185]; BBSRC [BB/1003460/1, BB/M019144/1]; Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council [BB/M019144/1]","This work was supported, in part, by NSF DMS-1413185 to SW and by BBSRC [BB/1003460/1] and [BB/M019144/1] to NMK.

Both neurotransmitter-evoked (I-evoked) and neurotransmitter-independent basal (I-basal) GIRK activities are physiologically important, but mechanisms of I-basal and its relation to I-evoked are unclear. We have previously shown for heterologously expressed neuronal GIRK1/2, and now show for native GIRK in hippocampal neurons, that I-basal and I-evoked are interrelated: the extent of activation by neurotransmitter (activation index, R-a) is inversely related to I-basal. To unveil the underlying mechanisms, we have developed a quantitative model of GIRK1/2 function. We characterized single-channel and macroscopic GIRK1/2 currents, and surface densities of GIRK1/2 and G beta gamma expressed in Xenopus oocytes. Based on experimental results, we constructed a mathematical model of GIRK1/2 activity under steady-state conditions before and after activation by neurotransmitter. Our model accurately recapitulates I-basal and I-evoked in Xenopus oocytes, HEK293 cells and hippocampal neurons; correctly predicts the dose-dependent activation of GIRK1/2 by coexpressed G beta gamma and fully accounts for the inverse I-basal-R-a correlation. Modeling indicates that, under all conditions and at different channel expression levels, between 3 and 4 G beta gamma dimers are available for each GIRK1/2 channel. In contrast, available G alpha(i/o) decreases from similar to 2 to less than one G alpha per channel as GIRK1/2's density increases. The persistent G beta gamma/channel (but not G alpha/channel) ratio support a strong association of GIRK1/2 with G beta gamma, consistent with recruitment to the cell surface of G beta gamma, but not G alpha, by GIRK1/2. Our analysis suggests a maximal stoichiometry of 4 G beta gamma but only 2 G alpha(i/o) per one GIRK1/2 channel. The unique, unequal association of GIRK1/2 with G protein subunits, and the cooperative nature of GIRK gating by G beta gamma, underlie the complex pattern of basal and agonist-evoked activities and allow GIRK1/2 to act as a sensitive bidirectional detector of both G beta gamma and G alpha.","[Yakubovich, Daniel; Berlin, Shai; Kahanovitch, Uri; Rubinstein, Moran; Farhy-Tselnicker, Isabella; Styr, Boaz; Keren-Raifman, Tal; Dascal, Nathan] Tel Aviv Univ, Dept Physiol & Pharmacol, IL-69978 Tel Aviv, Israel; [Yakubovich, Daniel; Berlin, Shai; Kahanovitch, Uri; Rubinstein, Moran; Farhy-Tselnicker, Isabella; Styr, Boaz; Keren-Raifman, Tal; Dascal, Nathan] Tel Aviv Univ, Sagol Sch Neurosci, IL-69978 Tel Aviv, Israel; [Dessauer, Carmen W.] Univ Texas Hlth Sci Ctr Houston, Dept Integrat Biol & Pharmacol, Houston, TX 77030 USA","Yakubovich, D (reprint author), Tel Aviv Univ, Dept Physiol & Pharmacol, IL-69978 Tel Aviv, Israel.",dascaln@tauex.tau.ac.il,"Farhy, Isabella/P-1367-2018; Dascal, Nathan/O-3915-2015","Dascal, Nathan/0000-0002-5397-4146; Kahanovitch, Uri/0000-0002-6203-7103","US-Israel Binational Science Foundation [2009255, 2013230]; Israeli Science Foundation [49/08, 436/14]","This work was supported by the US-Israel Binational Science Foundation (http://www.bsf.org.il/), grants no. 2009255 and 2013230; and by Israeli Science Foundation, http://www.isf.org.il/, grants no. 49/08 and 436/14.

Studying tumor SCNAs using massively parallel sequencing provides unprecedented resolution and meanwhile gives rise to new challenges in data analysis, complicated by tumor aneuploidy and heterogeneity as well as normal cell contamination. While the majority of read depth based methods utilize total sequencing depth alone for SCNA inference, the allele specific signals are undervalued. We proposed a joint segmentation and inference approach using both signals to meet some of the challenges. Our method consists of four major steps: 1) extracting read depth supporting reference and alternative alleles at each SNP/Indel locus and comparing the total read depth and alternative allele proportion between tumor and matched normal sample; 2) performing joint segmentation on the two signal dimensions; 3) correcting the copy number baseline from which the SCNA state is determined; 4) calling SCNA state for each segment based on both signal dimensions. The method is applicable to whole exome/genome sequencing (WES/WGS) as well as SNP array data in a tumor-control study. We applied the method to a dataset containing no SCNAs to test the specificity, created by pairing sequencing replicates of a single HapMap sample as normal/tumor pairs, as well as a large-scale WGS dataset consisting of 88 liver tumors along with adjacent normal tissues. Compared with representative methods, our method demonstrated improved accuracy, scalability to large cancer studies, capability in handling both sequencing and SNP array data, and the potential to improve the estimation of tumor ploidy and purity.","[Zhang, Zhongyang; Hao, Ke] Icahn Sch Med Mt Sinai, Dept Genet & Genom Sci, New York, NY 10029 USA; [Zhang, Zhongyang; Hao, Ke] Icahn Sch Med Mt Sinai, Icahn Inst Genom & Multiscale Biol, New York, NY 10029 USA; [Hao, Ke] Tongji Univ, Dept Resp Med, Shanghai Peoples Hosp 10, Shanghai 200092, Peoples R China","Zhang, ZY (reprint author), Icahn Sch Med Mt Sinai, Dept Genet & Genom Sci, New York, NY 10029 USA.",zhongyang.zhang@mssm.edu; ke.hao@mssm.edu,,,National Natural Science Foundation of China [21477087]; Melanoma Research Foundation [322881],"KH is partially supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 21477087; the funder's website is http://www.nsfc.gov.cn/publish/portal1/) and Melanoma Research Foundation Award (Award ID: 322881; The funder's website is http://www.melanoma.org/).

Recent studies revealed that several HRMs including let-7 family miRNAs were highly induced in response to HIF (hypoxia-inducible factor) stabilization in hypoxia, and they potently participated in angiogenesis by targeting AGO1 (argonaute 1) and upregulating VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor). Here we constructed a novel computational model of microRNA control of HIF-VEGF pathway in endothelial cells to quantitatively investigate the role of HRMs in modulating the cellular adaptation to hypoxia. The model parameters were optimized and the simulations based on these parameters were validated against several published in vitro experimental data. To advance the mechanistic understanding of oxygen sensing in hypoxia, we demonstrated that the rate of HIF-1 alpha nuclear import substantially influences its stabilization and the formation of HIF-1 transcription factor complex. We described the biological feedback loops involving let-7 and AGO1 in which the impact of external perturbations were minimized; as a pair of master regulators when low oxygen tension was sensed, they coordinated the critical process of VEGF desuppression in a controlled manner. Prompted by the model-motivated discoveries, we proposed and assessed novel pathway-specific therapeutics that modulate angiogenesis by adjusting VEGF synthesis in tumor and ischemic cardiovascular disease. Through simulations that capture the complex interactions between miRNAs and miRNA-processing molecules, this model explores an innovative perspective about the distinctive yet integrated roles of different miRNAs in angiogenesis, and it will help future research to elucidate the dysregulated miRNA profiles found in cancer and various cardiovascular diseases.","[Zhao, Chen; Popel, Aleksander S.] Johns Hopkins Univ, Sch Med, Dept Biomed Engn, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA","Zhao, C (reprint author), Johns Hopkins Univ, Sch Med, Dept Biomed Engn, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA.",czhao22@jhu.edu,"Popel, Aleksander S/A-6724-2009","Popel, Aleksander/0000-0002-6706-9235","National Institutes of Health [R01HL101200, R01CA138264, R21HL122721]","This work was supported by National Institutes of Health grants R01HL101200, R01CA138264, and R21HL122721.

These kinetochore-attached K-fibres generate pushing and pulling forces, which combine with polar ejection forces (PEF) and elastic inter-sister chromatin to govern chromosome movements. Classic experiments in meiotic cells using calibrated micro-needles measured an approximate stall force for a chromosome, but methods that allow the systematic determination of forces acting on a kinetochore in living cells are lacking. Here we report the development of mathematical models that can be fitted (reverse engineered) to high-resolution kinetochore tracking data, thereby estimating the model parameters and allowing us to indirectly compute the (relative) force components (K-fibre, spring force and PEF) acting on individual sister kinetochores in vivo. We applied our methodology to thousands of human kinetochore pair trajectories and report distinct signatures in temporal force profiles during directional switches. We found the K-fibre force to be the dominant force throughout oscillations, and the centromeric spring the smallest although it has the strongest directional switching signature. There is also structure throughout the metaphase plate, with a steeper PEF potential well towards the periphery and a concomitant reduction in plate thickness and oscillation amplitude. This data driven reverse engineering approach is sufficiently flexible to allow fitting of more complex mechanistic models; mathematical models of kinetochore dynamics can therefore be thoroughly tested on experimental data for the first time. Future work will now be able to map out how individual proteins contribute to kinetochore-based force generation and sensing.","[Armond, Jonathan W.; Burroughs, Nigel J.] Univ Warwick, Warwick Syst Biol Ctr, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England; [Armond, Jonathan W.; Burroughs, Nigel J.] Univ Warwick, Math Inst, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England; [Harry, Edward F.] Univ Warwick, Mol Org & Assembly Cells MOAC Doctoral Training C, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England; [McAinsh, Andrew D.] Univ Warwick, Warwick Med Sch, Div Biomed Cell Biol, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England","Armond, JW (reprint author), Univ Warwick, Warwick Syst Biol Ctr, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England.",N.J.Burroughs@warwick.ac.uk,"; Armond, Jonathan/B-2773-2011; Harry, Edward/H-2167-2013","McAinsh, Andrew/0000-0001-6808-0711; Armond, Jonathan/0000-0001-5146-0910; Harry, Edward/0000-0003-1914-6432","Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council, UK [BB/I021353/1]; Wellcome Trust [106151/Z/14/Z]; Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council as part of the Molecular Organisation and Assembly in Cells (MOAC) doctoral training centre; Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council [BB/I021353/1]","This work was supported by the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council, UK [www.bbsrc.ac.uk; grant number BB/I021353/1 to ADM and NJB] and in part by a Wellcome Trust Senior Investigator Award [www.wellcome.ac.uk; grant number 106151/Z/14/Z to ADM].

Directed evolution is a powerful, but experimentally strenuous approach. Computational methods offer attractive alternatives. However, due to the limited reliability of predictions and potentially antagonistic effects of substitutions, only single-point mutations are usually predicted in silico, experimentally verified and then recombined in multiple-point mutants. Thus, substantial screening is still required. Here we present FireProt, a robust computational strategy for predicting highly stable multiple-point mutants that combines energy-and evolution-based approaches with smart filtering to identify additive stabilizing mutations. FireProt's reliability and applicability was demonstrated by validating its predictions against 656 mutations from the ProTherm database. We demonstrate that thermostability of the model enzymes haloalkane dehalogenase DhaA and gamma-hexachlorocyclohexane dehydrochlorinase LinA can be substantially increased (Delta T-m = 24 degrees C and 21 degrees C) by constructing and characterizing only a handful of multiple- point mutants.

Metastasis results from a sequence of multiple steps including invasion and migration. The early stages of metastasis are tightly controlled in normal cells and can be drastically affected by malignant mutations; therefore, they might constitute the principal determinants of the overall metastatic rate even if the later stages take long to occur. To elucidate the role of individual mutations or their combinations affecting the metastatic development, a logical model has been constructed that recapitulates published experimental results of known gene perturbations on local invasion and migration processes, and predict the effect of not yet experimentally assessed mutations. The model has been validated using experimental data on transcriptome dynamics following TGF-beta-dependent induction of Epithelial to Mesenchymal Transition in lung cancer cell lines. A method to associate gene expression profiles with different stable state solutions of the logical model has been developed for that purpose. In addition, we have systematically predicted alleviating (masking) and synergistic pairwise genetic interactions between the genes composing the model with respect to the probability of acquiring the metastatic phenotype. We focused on several unexpected synergistic genetic interactions leading to theoretically very high metastasis probability. Among them, the synergistic combination of Notch overexpression and p53 deletion shows one of the strongest effects, which is in agreement with a recent published experiment in a mouse model of gut cancer. The mathematical model can recapitulate experimental mutations in both cell line and mouse models. Furthermore, the model predicts new gene perturbations that affect the early steps of metastasis underlying potential intervention points for innovative therapeutic strategies in oncology.","[Cohen, David P.

In vascular disease, this process is activated inappropriately and causes thrombosis, heart attacks and stroke. The collagen receptor GPVI is the primary trigger for platelet activation at sites of injury. Understanding the complex molecular mechanisms initiated by this receptor is important for development of more effective antithrombotic medicines. In this work we developed a series of nonlinear ordinary differential equation models that are direct representations of biological hypotheses surrounding the initial steps in GPVI-stimulated signal transduction. At each stage model simulations were compared to our own quantitative, high-temporal experimental data that guides further experimental design, data collection and model refinement. Much is known about the linear forward reactions within platelet signalling pathways but knowledge of the roles of putative reverse reactions are poorly understood. An initial model, that includes a simple constitutively active phosphatase, was unable to explain experimental data. Model revisions, incorporating a complex pathway of interactions (and specifically the phosphatase TULA-2), provided a good description of the experimental data both based on observations of phosphorylation in samples from one donor and in those of a wider population. Our model was used to investigate the levels of proteins involved in regulating the pathway and the effect of low GPVI levels that have been associated with disease. Results indicate a clear separation in healthy and GPVI deficient states in respect of the signalling cascade dynamics associated with Syk tyrosine phosphorylation and activation. Our approach reveals the central importance of this negative feedback pathway that results in the temporal regulation of a specific class of protein tyrosine phosphatases in controlling the rate, and therefore extent, of GPVI-stimulated platelet activation.","[Dunster, Joanne L.; Tindall, Marcus J.] Univ Reading, Dept Math & Stat, Reading, Berks, England; [Dunster, Joanne L.; Mazet, Francoise; Fry, Michael J.; Gibbins, Jonathan M.] Univ Reading, Inst Cardiovasc & Metab Res, Reading, Berks, England; [Dunster, Joanne L.; Mazet, Francoise; Fry, Michael J.; Gibbins, Jonathan M.] Univ Reading, Sch Biol Sci, Reading, Berks, England","Dunster, JL (reprint author), Univ Reading, Dept Math & Stat, Reading, Berks, England.",j.l.dunster@reading.ac.uk,"Tindall, Marcus/D-8039-2018; Dunster, Joanne/G-8332-2017","Tindall, Marcus/0000-0001-6069-5260; Dunster, Joanne/0000-0001-8986-4902; Mazet, Francoise/0000-0002-2308-9170; Fry, Michael/0000-0001-8518-1370","British Heart Foundation; RCUK Fellowship (ESPRC) [EP/E500536/1]; British Heart Foundation [PG/13/93/30593, NH/10/2/28425]","This study was supported by the British Heart Foundation and MJT was supported by a RCUK Fellowship (ESPRC grant EP/E500536/1).

Behavioral experiments suggest that humans and some animals employ this strategy of breaking down cognitive or behavioral sequences into chunks in a wide variety of tasks, but the dynamical principles of how this is achieved remains unknown. Here, we study the temporal dynamics of chunking for learning cognitive sequences in a chunking representation using a dynamical model of competing modes arranged to evoke hierarchical Winnerless Competition (WLC) dynamics. Sequential memory is represented as trajectories along a chain of metastable fixed points at each level of the hierarchy, and bistable Hebbian dynamics enables the learning of such trajectories in an unsupervised fashion. Using computer simulations, we demonstrate the learning of a chunking representation of sequences and their robust recall. During learning, the dynamics associates a set of modes to each information-carrying item in the sequence and encodes their relative order. During recall, hierarchical WLC guarantees the robustness of the sequence order when the sequence is not too long. The resulting patterns of activities share several features observed in behavioral experiments, such as the pauses between boundaries of chunks, their size and their duration. Failures in learning chunking sequences provide new insights into the dynamical causes of neurological disorders such as Parkinson's disease and Schizophrenia.","[Fonollosa, Jordi; Neftci, Emre; Rabinovich, Mikhail] Univ Calif San Diego, Biocircuits Inst, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Fonollosa, Jordi] Inst Bioengn Catalonia, Barcelona, Spain; [Neftci, Emre] Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Cognit Sci, Irvine, CA 92717 USA","Fonollosa, J (reprint author), Univ Calif San Diego, Biocircuits Inst, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA.",eneftci@uci.edu,"Fonollosa, Jordi/L-2303-2014","Fonollosa, Jordi/0000-0001-8854-8588","NSF [EFRI-1137279]; ONR [MURI 14-13-1-0205, MURI N00014-13-1-0678]; Beatriu de Pinos grant [BP-B-00190]","This work was funded by: NSF EFRI-1137279 (to EN), ONR MURI 14-13-1-0205 (to EN, JF, MR), ONR MURI N00014-13-1-0678 (MR), and the Beatriu de Pinos grant BP-B-00190 (to JF).

Though each of them has been variously recognized in previous works as expression of the excitability of the cortical tissue and the associated nonlinear dynamics, a unified picture of the determinant factors (dynamical and architectural) is desirable and not yet available. Progress has also been partially hindered by the use of a variety of statistical measures to define the network events of interest. We propose here a common probabilistic definition of network events that, applied to the firing activity of cultured neural networks, highlights the co-occurrence of network spikes, power-law distributed avalanches, and exponentially distributed 'quasi-orbits', which offer a third type of collective behavior. A rate model, including synaptic excitation and inhibition with no imposed topology, synaptic short-term depression, and finite-size noise, accounts for all these different, coexisting phenomena. We find that their emergence is largely regulated by the proximity to an oscillatory instability of the dynamics, where the non-linear excitable behavior leads to a self-amplification of activity fluctuations over a wide range of scales in space and time. In this sense, the cultured network dynamics is compatible with an excitation-inhibition balance corresponding to a slightly sub-critical regime. Finally, we propose and test a method to infer the characteristic time of the fatigue process, from the observed time course of the network's firing rate. Unlike the model, possessing a single fatigue mechanism, the cultured network appears to show multiple time scales, signalling the possible coexistence of different fatigue mechanisms.","[Gigante, Guido; Del Giudice, Paolo] Italian Inst Hlth, Rome, Italy; [Gigante, Guido] Mperience Srl, Rome, Italy; [Deco, Gustavo] Univ Pompeu Fabra, Dept Informat & Commun Technol, Ctr Brain & Cognit, Computat Neurosci Grp, Barcelona, Spain; [Deco, Gustavo] Univ Pompeu Fabra, Inst Catalana Recerca & Estudis Avancats, Barcelona, Spain; [Marom, Shimon] Technion Israel Inst Technol, Haifa, Israel; [Del Giudice, Paolo] Ist Nazl Fis Nucl, Rome, Italy","Gigante, G (reprint author), Italian Inst Hlth, Rome, Italy.",guido.gigante@mperience.com,"DECO, GUSTAVO/A-6341-2008","DECO, GUSTAVO/0000-0002-8995-7583; Del Giudice, Paolo/0000-0002-5633-8241; Marom, Shimon/0000-0002-9138-4833; Gigante, Guido/0000-0003-1899-4579",EU [FP7-ICT-269459]; ICREA,"We aknowledge the support of EU-Project CORONET (FP7-ICT-269459).

While recent studies using single cell transcriptome analysis illustrate the power to measure and understand cellular heterogeneity in complex biological systems, processing large amounts of RNA-seq data from heterogeneous cell populations creates the need for readily accessible tools for the analysis of single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) profiles. The present study presents a generally applicable analytic pipeline (SINCERA: a computational pipeline for SINgle CEll RNA-seq profiling Analysis) for processing scRNA-seq data from a whole organ or sorted cells. The pipeline supports the analysis for: 1) the distinction and identification of major cell types; 2) the identification of cell type specific gene signatures; and 3) the determination of driving forces of given cell types. We applied this pipeline to the RNA-seq analysis of single cells isolated from embryonic mouse lung at E16.5. Through the pipeline analysis, we distinguished major cell types of fetal mouse lung, including epithelial, endothelial, smooth muscle, pericyte, and fibroblast-like cell types, and identified cell type specific gene signatures, bioprocesses, and key regulators.

This coupled activity is conveniently expressed using covariance, but this measure fails to distinguish between direct and indirect effects. A popular alternative that addresses this issue is partial correlation, which regresses out the signal of potentially confounding variables, resulting in a measure that reveals only direct connections. Importantly, provided the data are normally distributed, if two variables are conditionally independent given all other variables, their respective partial correlation is zero. In this paper, we propose a probabilistic generative model that allows us to estimate functional connectivity in terms of both partial correlations and a graph representing conditional independencies. Simulation results show that this methodology is able to outperform the graphical LASSO, which is the de facto standard for estimating partial correlations. Furthermore, we apply the model to estimate functional connectivity for twenty subjects using resting-state fMRI data. Results show that our model provides a richer representation of functional connectivity as compared to considering partial correlations alone. Finally, we demonstrate how our approach can be extended in several ways, for instance to achieve data fusion by informing the conditional independence graph with data from probabilistic tractography. As our Bayesian formulation of functional connectivity provides access to the posterior distribution instead of only to point estimates, we are able to quantify the uncertainty associated with our results. This reveals that while we are able to infer a clear backbone of connectivity in our empirical results, the data are not accurately described by simply looking at the mode of the distribution over connectivity. The implication of this is that deterministic alternatives may misjudge connectivity results by drawing conclusions from noisy and limited data.","[Hinne, Max; Heskes, Tom] Radboud Univ Nijmegen, Inst Comp & Informat Sci, NL-6525 ED Nijmegen, Netherlands; [Hinne, Max; Janssen, Ronald J.; van Gerven, Marcel A.

We propose that inherently stochastic features of synaptic plasticity and spine motility enable cortical networks of neurons to carry out probabilistic inference by sampling from a posterior distribution of network configurations. This model provides a viable alternative to existing models that propose convergence of parameters to maximum likelihood values. It explains how priors on weight distributions and connection probabilities can be merged optimally with learned experience, how cortical networks can generalize learned information so well to novel experiences, and how they can compensate continuously for unforeseen disturbances of the network.

Several bioinformatic tools can be used to functionally annotate metagenomes, allowing researchers to draw inferences about the functional potential of the community and to identify putative functional biomarkers. However, little is known about how decisions made during annotation affect the reliability of the results. Here, we use statistical simulations to rigorously assess how to optimize annotation accuracy and speed, given parameters of the input data like read length and library size. We identify best practices in metagenome annotation and use them to guide the development of the Shotgun Metagenome Annotation Pipeline (ShotMAP). ShotMAP is an analytically flexible, end-to-end annotation pipeline that can be implemented either on a local computer or a cloud compute cluster. We use ShotMAP to assess how different annotation databases impact the interpretation of how marine metagenome and metatranscriptome functional capacity changes across seasons. We also apply ShotMAP to data obtained from a clinical microbiome investigation of inflammatory bowel disease. This analysis finds that gut microbiota collected from Crohn's disease patients are functionally distinct from gut microbiota collected from either ulcerative colitis patients or healthy controls, with differential abundance of metabolic pathways related to host-microbiome interactions that may serve as putative biomarkers of disease.","[Nayfach, Stephen; Bradley, Patrick H.; Wyman, Stacia K.; Laurent, Timothy J.; Williams, Alex; Pollard, Katherine S.; Sharpton, Thomas J.] Gladstone Inst Cardiovasc Dis, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; [Eisen, Jonathan A.] Univ Calif Davis, UC Davis Genome Ctr, Dept Ecol & Evolut, Dept Med Microbiol & Immunol, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Pollard, Katherine S.] Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Epidemiol & Biostat, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; [Pollard, Katherine S.] Univ Calif San Francisco, Inst Human Genet, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; [Sharpton, Thomas J.] Oregon State Univ, Dept Microbiol, Dept Stat, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA","Nayfach, S (reprint author), Gladstone Inst Cardiovasc Dis, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA.",kpollard@gladstone.ucsf.edu; thomas.sharpton@oregonstate.edu,"Eisen, Jonathan A./H-2706-2019","Eisen, Jonathan A./0000-0002-0159-2197",NSF [DMS-1069303]; Gordon & Betty Moore Foundation [3300]; San Simeon Fund; Gladstone Institutes; Oregon State University,"This project was supported by funding from NSF grant #DMS-1069303, Gordon & Betty Moore Foundation grant #3300, the San Simeon Fund, institutional funds from Gladstone Institutes, and institutional funds from Oregon State University.

The template-matching operation implemented by the linear-nonlinear cascade (linear filter followed by static nonlinearity) is the most widely adopted computational tool in systems neuroscience. This simple model achieves remarkable explanatory power while retaining analytical tractability, potentially extending its reach to a wide range of systems and levels in sensory processing. The extent of its applicability to human behaviour, however, remains unclear. Because sensory stimuli possess multiple attributes (e. g. position, orientation, size), the issue of applicability may be asked by considering each attribute one at a time in relation to a family of linear-nonlinear models, or by considering all attributes collectively in relation to a specified implementation of the linear-nonlinear cascade. We demonstrate that human visual processing can operate under conditions that are indistinguishable from linear-nonlinear transduction with respect to substantially different stimulus attributes of a uniquely specified target signal with associated behavioural task. However, no specific implementation of a linear-nonlinear cascade is able to account for the entire collection of results across attributes; a satisfactory account at this level requires the introduction of a small gain-control circuit, resulting in a model that no longer belongs to the linear-nonlinear family. Our results inform and constrain efforts at obtaining and interpreting comprehensive characterizations of the human sensory process by demonstrating its inescapably nonlinear nature, even under conditions that have been painstakingly fine-tuned to facilitate template-matching behaviour and to produce results that, at some level of inspection, do conform to linear filtering predictions. They also suggest that compliance with linear transduction may be the targeted outcome of carefully crafted nonlinear circuits, rather than default behaviour exhibited by basic components.","[Neri, Peter] CNRS, Lab Syst Perceptifs, UMR 8248, F-75005 Paris, France; [Neri, Peter] PSL Res Univ, Ecole Normale Super, Inst Etud Cognit, F-75005 Paris, France","Neri, P (reprint author), CNRS, Lab Syst Perceptifs, UMR 8248, 29 Rue Ulm, F-75005 Paris, France.",neri.peter@gmail.com,,"Neri, Peter/0000-0003-1981-5309",Royal Society; LSP Vision Team;  [ANR-10-LABX-0087 IEC];  [ANR-10-IDEX-0001-02 PSL*],"This work was supported by a University Research Fellowship from the Royal Society (https://royalsociety.org/) to PN, program ANR-10-LABX-0087 IEC, program ANR-10-IDEX-0001-02 PSL*, and core funding from the LSP Vision Team.

This compression or expansion could be selective for individual grid cell modules with particular properties of spatial scaling. We present a model for differences in the response of modules to barrier location that arise from different mechanisms for the influence of visual features on the computation of location that drives grid cell firing patterns. These differences could arise from differences in the position of visual features within the visual field. When location was computed from the movement of visual features on the ground plane (optic flow) in the ventral visual field, this resulted in grid cell spatial firing that was not sensitive to barrier location in modules modeled with small spacing between grid cell firing fields. In contrast, when location was computed from static visual features on walls of barriers, i.e. in the more dorsal visual field, this resulted in grid cell spatial firing that compressed or expanded based on the barrier locations in modules modeled with large spacing between grid cell firing fields. This indicates that different grid cell modules might have differential properties for computing location based on visual cues, or the spatial radius of sensitivity to visual cues might differ between modules.","[Raudies, Florian; Hasselmo, Michael E.] Boston Univ, Ctr Syst Neurosci, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Raudies, Florian; Hasselmo, Michael E.] Boston Univ, Dept Psychol & Brain Sci, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Raudies, Florian] Boston Univ, Ctr Computat Neurosci & Neural Technol, Boston, MA 02215 USA","Raudies, F (reprint author), Hewlett Packard Labs, Palo Alto, CA 94304 USA.",florian.raudies@gmail.com,,"Hasselmo, Michael/0000-0002-9925-6377","Office of Naval Research ONR MURI [N00014-10-1-0936]; National Science Foundation CELEST [SMA-0835976]; National Institutes of Mental Health Silvio O.

This increases Ca2+ binding to ligand-gated channels known as ryanodine receptors (RyR2). Their openings cause cell-wide release of Ca2+, which in turn causes muscle contraction and the generation of the mechanical force required to pump blood. In resting myocytes, RyR2s can also open spontaneously giving rise to spatially-confined Ca2+ release events known as ""sparks."" RyR2s are organized in a lattice to form clusters in the junctional sarcoplasmic reticulum membrane. Our recent work has shown that the spatial arrangement of RyR2s within clusters strongly influences the frequency of Ca2+ sparks. We showed that the probability of a Ca2+ spark occurring when a single RyR2 in the cluster opens spontaneously can be predicted from the precise spatial arrangements of the RyR2s. Thus, ""function"" follows from ""structure."" This probability is related to the maximum eigenvalue (lambda(1)) of the adjacency matrix of the RyR2 cluster lattice. In this work, we develop a theoretical framework for understanding this relationship. We present a stochastic contact network model of the Ca2+ spark initiation process. We show that lambda(1) determines a stability threshold for the formation of Ca2+ sparks in terms of the RyR2 gating transition rates. We recapitulate these results by applying the model to realistic RyR2 cluster structures informed by super-resolution stimulated emission depletion (STED) microscopy. Eigendecomposition of the linearized mean-field contact network model reveals functional subdomains within RyR2 clusters with distinct sensitivities to Ca2+. This work provides novel perspectives on the cardiac Ca2+ release process and a general method for inferring the functional properties of transmembrane receptor clusters from their structure.","[Walker, Mark A.; Greenstein, Joseph L.; Winslow, Raimond L.] Johns Hopkins Univ, Dept Biomed Engn, Inst Computat Med, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA; [Kohl, Tobias; Lehnart, Stephan E.] Univ Med Ctr Groningen, Heart Res Ctr Gottingen, Clin Cardiol & Pulmonol, Gottingen, Germany; [Lehnart, Stephan E.] German Ctr Cardiovasc Res Site Gottingen, Gottingen, Germany; [Lederer, W.

Tensile forces, propagating from the membrane through the PIP2 binding site of the FERM domain and from the cytoskeleton-anchored FAT domain, activate FAK by unlocking its central phosphorylation site (Tyr576/577) from the autoinhibitory FERM domain. Varying loading rates, pulling directions, and membrane PIP2 concentrations corroborate the specific opening of the FERM-kinase domain interface, due to its remarkably lower mechanical stability compared to the individual alpha-helical domains and the PIP2-FERM link. Analyzing downstream signaling networks provides further evidence for an intrinsic mechano-signaling role of FAK in broadcasting force signals through Ras to the nucleus.

This hypothesis has so far provided only qualitative predictions and their confirmations. We report this hypothesis' first quantitative prediction, derived without free parameters, and its confirmation by human behavioral data. The hypothesis provides a direct link between V1 neural responses to a visual location and the saliency of that location to guide attention exogenously. In a visual input containing many bars, one of them saliently different from all the other bars which are identical to each other, saliency at the singleton's location can be measured by the shortness of the reaction time in a visual search for singletons. The hypothesis predicts quantitatively the whole distribution of the reaction times to find a singleton unique in color, orientation, and motion direction from the reaction times to find other types of singletons. The prediction matches human reaction time data. A requirement for this successful prediction is a data-motivated assumption that V1 lacks neurons tuned simultaneously to color, orientation, and motion direction of visual inputs. Since evidence suggests that extrastriate cortices do have such neurons, we discuss the possibility that the extrastriate cortices play no role in guiding exogenous attention so that they can be devoted to other functions like visual decoding and endogenous attention.","[Zhaoping, Li] UCL, London, England; [Zhe, Li] Tsinghua Univ, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China","Zhaoping, L (reprint author), UCL, London, England.",z.li@ucl.ac.uk,,"Li, Zhe/0000-0003-4176-9687",Gatsby Charitable Foundation; 985 fund of Tsinghua University,"This work was supported by the Gatsby Charitable Foundation and by 985 fund of Tsinghua University.

We show that the network models closely reproduce the regional volumetric gray matter atrophy distribution of two epilepsy cohorts: 29 TLE subjects with medial temporal sclerosis (TLE-MTS), and 50 TLE subjects with normal appearance on MRI (TLE-no). Statistical validation at the group level suggests high correlation with measured atrophy (R = 0.586 for TLE-MTS, R = 0.283 for TLE-no). We conclude that atrophy spread model out-performs the hyperactivity spread model. These results pave the way for future clinical application of the proposed model on individual patients, including estimating future spread of atrophy, identification of seizure onset zones and surgical planning.","[Abdelnour, Farras; Raj, Ashish] Weill Cornell Med Coll, Radiol, New York, NY 10065 USA; [Mueller, Susanne] Univ Calif San Francisco, Radiol, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA","Abdelnour, F (reprint author), Weill Cornell Med Coll, Radiol, New York, NY 10065 USA.",faa2016@med.cornell.edu,,,NIH [R01 NS075425],"NIH grant R01 NS075425.

Such responses emerge in higher brain areas, thereby suggesting that they occur by integrating afferent input. However, the mechanisms by which such integration occurs are poorly understood. Here we show that midbrain electrosensory neurons can respond selectively and in an invariant manner to heterogeneity in behaviorally relevant stimulus waveforms. Such invariant responses were not seen in hindbrain electrosensory neurons providing afferent input to these midbrain neurons, suggesting that response invariance results from nonlinear integration of such input. To test this hypothesis, we built a model based on the Hodgkin-Huxley formalism that received realistic afferent input. We found that multiple combinations of parameter values could give rise to invariant responses matching those seen experimentally. Our model thus shows that there are multiple solutions towards achieving invariant responses and reveals how subthreshold membrane conductances help promote robust and invariant firing in response to heterogeneous stimulus waveforms associated with behaviorally relevant stimuli. We discuss the implications of our findings for the electrosensory and other systems.","[Aumentado-Armstrong, Tristan] McGill Univ, Sch Comp Sci, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Metzen, Michael G.; Sproule, Michael K.

To obtain the best possible structural model of the molecule at the best achievable resolution, and without any missing gaps, one typically aligns (match and fits) the atomistic structure model with the 3D EM map. We discuss a new algorithm and generalized framework, named PF2 fit (Polar Fast Fourier Fitting) for the best possible structural alignment of atomistic structures with 3D EM. While PF2 fit enables only a rigid, six dimensional (6D) alignment method, it augments prior work on 6D X-ray structure and 3D EM alignment in multiple ways: Scoring. PF2 fit includes a new scoring scheme that, in addition to rewarding overlaps between the volumes occupied by the atomistic structure and 3D EM map, rewards overlaps between the volumes complementary to them. We quantitatively demonstrate how this new complementary scoring scheme improves upon existing approaches. PF2 fit also includes two scoring functions, the non-uniform exterior penalty and the skeleton-secondary structure score, and implements the scattering potential score as an alternative to traditional Gaussian blurring. Search. PF2 fit utilizes a fast polar Fourier search scheme, whose main advantage is the ability to search over uniformly and adaptively sampled subsets of the space of rigid-body motions. PF2 fit also implements a new reranking search and scoring methodology that considerably improves alignment metrics in results obtained from the initial search.","[Bettadapura, Radhakrishna] Univ Texas Austin, Dept Mech Engn, Radhakrishna Bettadapura Computat Visualizat Cent, Austin, TX 78712 USA; [Rasheed, Muhibur] Univ Texas Austin, Dept Mech Engn, Muhibur Rasheed Computat Visualizat Center, Austin, TX 78712 USA; [Vollrath, Antje] Tech Univ Carolo Wilhelmina Braunschweig, Antje Vollrath Inst Computat Math, D-38106 Braunschweig, Germany; [Bajaj, Chandrajit] Univ Texas Austin, Dept Comp Sci, Chandrajit Bajaj Computat Visualizat Center, Inst Computat Engn & Sci, Austin, TX 78712 USA","Bettadapura, R (reprint author), Univ Texas Austin, Dept Mech Engn, Radhakrishna Bettadapura Computat Visualizat Cent, Austin, TX 78712 USA.",bajaj@cs.utexas.edu,,, [NIH-R01-EB004873];  [NIH-R01GM117594];  [NSF-OCI-1216701],"This research in part was funded by grants NIH-R01-EB004873, NIH-R01GM117594 and NSF-OCI-1216701, the center for computational visualization http://cvcweb.ices.utexas.edu/ and the Texas Advanced Computing Center TACC https://www.tacc.utexas.edu/.

T6S kills vulnerable cells, and is present in close to 25% of sequenced Gram-negative bacteria. To examine the ecological role of T6S among bacteria, we competed selfimmune T6S+ cells and T6S-sensitive cells in simulated range expansions. As killing takes place only at the interface between sensitive and T6S+ strains, while growth takes place everywhere, sufficiently large domains of sensitive cells can achieve net growth in the face of attack. Indeed T6S-sensitive cells can often outgrow their T6S+ competitors. We validated these findings through in vivo competition experiments between T6S+ Vibrio cholerae and T6S-sensitive Escherichia coli. We found that E. coli can survive and even dominate so long as they have an adequate opportunity to form microcolonies at the outset of the competition. Finally, in simulated competitions between two equivalent and mutually sensitive T6S+ strains, the more numerous strain has an advantage that increases with the T6S attack rate. We conclude that sufficiently large domains of T6S-sensitive individuals can survive attack and potentially outcompete self-immune T6S+ bacteria.","[Borenstein, David Bruce; Wingreen, Ned S.] Princeton Univ, Lewis Sigler Inst Integrat Genom, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [Ringel, Peter; Basler, Marek] Univ Basel, Biozentrum, Basel, Switzerland; [Wingreen, Ned S.] Princeton Univ, Dept Mol Biol, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA","Borenstein, DB (reprint author), Princeton Univ, Lewis Sigler Inst Integrat Genom, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA.",wingreen@princeton.edu,"Basler, Marek/A-3559-2012","Basler, Marek/0000-0001-5414-2088","National Science Foundation [PHY-1305525, MCB-1119232, MCB-1344191]; Eric and Wendy Schmidt Transformative Technology Fund, SNSF Starting Grant [BSSGI0_155778]; University of Basel; Biozentrum Basel International PhD Program ""Fellowships for Excellence""","This work was supported in part by National Science Foundation Grants PHY-1305525, MCB-1119232, and MCB-1344191, the Eric and Wendy Schmidt Transformative Technology Fund, SNSF Starting Grant BSSGI0_155778, and the University of Basel.

Mutations that prevent the proper formation of the correct complexes can have serious consequences for the associated cellular processes. Since experimental determination of protein-protein binding affinity remains difficult when performed on a large scale, computational methods for predicting the consequences of mutations on binding affinity are highly desirable. We show that a scoring function based on interface structure profiles collected from analogous protein-protein interactions in the PDB is a powerful predictor of protein binding affinity changes upon mutation. As a standalone feature, the differences between the interface profile score of the mutant and wild-type proteins has an accuracy equivalent to the best all-atom potentials, despite being two orders of magnitude faster once the profile has been constructed. Due to its unique sensitivity in collecting the evolutionary profiles of analogous binding interactions and the high speed of calculation, the interface profile score has additional advantages as a complementary feature to combine with physics-based potentials for improving the accuracy of composite scoring approaches. By incorporating the sequence-derived and residue-level coarse-grained potentials with the interface structure profile score, a composite model was constructed through the random forest training, which generates a Pearson correlation coefficient >0.8 between the predicted and observed binding free-energy changes upon mutation. This accuracy is comparable to, or outperforms in most cases, the current best methods, but does not require high-resolution full-atomic models of the mutant structures. The binding interface profiling approach should find useful application in human-disease mutation recognition and protein interface design studies.","[Brender, Jeffrey R.; Zhang, Yang] Univ Michigan, Dept Computat Med & Bioinformat, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Zhang, Yang] Univ Michigan, Dept Biol Chem, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA","Brender, JR (reprint author), Univ Michigan, Dept Computat Med & Bioinformat, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",zhng@umich.edu,,"brender, jeffrey/0000-0001-7487-6169",National Institute of General Medical Sciences [GM083107],"The project is supported in part by the National Institute of General Medical Sciences (GM083107) granted to YZ.

The spatially-structured connections in the deep layer support the propagation of a traveling front, which then drives propagating orientation-dependent activity in the superficial layer. Using a combination of mathematical analysis and numerical simulations, we establish that the existence of a coherent orientation-selective wave relies on the presence of weak, long-range connections in the superficial layer that couple cells of similar orientation preference. Moreover, the wave persists in the presence of feedback from the superficial layer to the deep layer.

Upon stimulus presentation there is an early phase of feedforward processing where the visual information is propagated from lower to higher visual areas for the extraction of basic and complex stimulus features. This is followed by a later phase where horizontal connections within areas and feedback connections from higher areas back to lower areas come into play. In this later phase, image elements that are behaviorally relevant are grouped by Gestalt grouping rules and are labeled in the cortex with enhanced neuronal activity (object-based attention in psychology). Recent neurophysiological studies revealed that reward-based learning influences these recurrent grouping processes, but it is not well understood how rewards train recurrent circuits for perceptual organization. This paper examines the mechanisms for reward-based learning of new grouping rules. We derive a learning rule that can explain how rewards influence the information flow through feedforward, horizontal and feedback connections. We illustrate the efficiency with two tasks that have been used to study the neuronal correlates of perceptual organization in early visual cortex. The first task is called contour-integration and demands the integration of collinear contour elements into an elongated curve. We show how reward-based learning causes an enhancement of the representation of the to-be-grouped elements at early levels of a recurrent neural network, just as is observed in the visual cortex of monkeys. The second task is curve-tracing where the aim is to determine the endpoint of an elongated curve composed of connected image elements. If trained with the new learning rule, neural networks learn to propagate enhanced activity over the curve, in accordance with neurophysiological data. We close the paper with a number of model predictions that can be tested in future neurophysiological and computational studies.","[Brosch, Tobias; Neumann, Heiko] Univ Ulm, Inst Neural Informat Proc, D-89069 Ulm, Germany; [Roelfsema, Pieter R.] Netherlands Inst Neurosci KNAW, Dept Vis & Cognit, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Roelfsema, Pieter R.] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Ctr Neurogen & Cognit Res, Dept Integrat Neurophysiol, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Roelfsema, Pieter R.] Univ Amsterdam, Acad Med Ctr, Dept Psychiat, NL-1105 AZ Amsterdam, Netherlands","Brosch, T (reprint author), Univ Ulm, Inst Neural Informat Proc, D-89069 Ulm, Germany.",heiko.neumann@uni-ulm.de,"Roelfsema, Pieter/J-6903-2013","Roelfsema, Pieter/0000-0002-1625-0034","Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (ALW grant) [823.02.010]; EU [339490, PITN-GA-2011-290011]; Transregional Collaborative Research Center ""A Companion Technology for Cognitive Technical Systems"" - German Research Foundation (DFG) [SFB/TR-62]; graduate school MAEIC at Ulm University; European Union Seventh Framework Programme (FP7) (Human Brain Project) [604102]; Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (Natural Artificial Intelligence project) [656.000.002]; Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (Excellence Program Brain Cognition) [433-09-208]","PRR is supported by grants from the Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (ALW grant no. 823.02.010, Natural Artificial Intelligence project 656.000.002, and grant no. 433-09-208 from the Excellence Program Brain & Cognition) and from the EU (ERC Grant Agreement no. 339490 and Marie-Curie Action PITN-GA-2011-290011).

Inspired by recent experiments, here we systematically investigate the contribution of a novel identified GABAergic pallido-cortical pathway, projecting from the globus pallidus externa (GPe) in the BG to the cerebral cortex, to the control of absence seizures. By computational modelling, we find that both increasing the activation of GPe neurons and enhancing the coupling strength of the inhibitory pallido-cortical pathway can suppress the bilaterally synchronous 2-4 Hz spike and wave discharges (SWDs) during absence seizures. Appropriate tuning of several GPe-related pathways may also trigger the SWD suppression, through modulating the activation level of GPe neurons. Furthermore, we show that the previously discovered bidirectional control of absence seizures due to the competition between other two BG output pathways also exists in our established model. Importantly, such bidirectional control is shaped by the coupling strength of this direct GABAergic pallido-cortical pathway. Our work suggests that the novel identified pallido-cortical pathway has a functional role in controlling absence seizures and the presented results might provide testable hypotheses for future experimental studies.","[Chen, Mingming; Guo, Daqing; Li, Min; Ma, Tao; Wu, Shengdun; Ma, Jingling; Cui, Yan; Xia, Yang; Xu, Peng; Yao, Dezhong] Univ Elect Sci & Technol China, Sch Life Sci & Technol, Minist Educ, Key Lab NeuroInformat, Chengdu 610054, Peoples R China; [Guo, Daqing; Xia, Yang; Xu, Peng; Yao, Dezhong] Univ Elect Sci & Technol China, Ctr Informat Med, Chengdu 610054, Peoples R China","Guo, DQ (reprint author), Univ Elect Sci & Technol China, Sch Life Sci & Technol, Minist Educ, Key Lab NeuroInformat, Chengdu 610054, Peoples R China.",dqguo@uestc.edu.cn; dyao@uestc.edu.cn,"Guo, Daqing/G-5867-2010","Yao, Dezhong/0000-0002-8042-879X","National Natural Science Foundation of China [61201278, 81571770, 81371636, 81330032, 91232725]","This work is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 61201278, No. 81571770, No. 81371636, No. 81330032, and No. 91232725).

Mutual information is now often used to quantify the fidelity with which information is transmitted along a cellular pathway. Mutual information calculations from experimental data have mostly generated low values, suggesting that cells might have relatively low signal transmission fidelity. In this work, we demonstrate that mutual information calculations might be artificially lowered by cell-to-cell variability in both initial conditions and slowly fluctuating global factors across the population. We carry out our analysis computationally using a simple signaling pathway and demonstrate that in the presence of slow global fluctuations, every cell might have its own high information transmission capacity but that population averaging underestimates this value.

ASCT2 is highly expressed in peripheral tissues such as the lung and intestines where it contributes to the homeostasis of intracellular concentrations of neutral amino acids. ASCT2 also plays an important role in the development of a variety of cancers such as melanoma by transporting amino acid nutrients such as glutamine into the proliferating tumors. Therefore, ASCT2 is a key drug target with potentially great pharmacological importance. Here, we identify seven ASCT2 ligands by computational modeling and experimental testing. In particular, we construct homology models based on crystallographic structures of the aspartate transporter Glt(Ph) in two different conformations. Optimization of the models' binding sites for protein-ligand complementarity reveals new putative pockets that can be targeted via structure-based drug design. Virtual screening of drugs, metabolites, fragments-like, and lead-like molecules from the ZINC database, followed by experimental testing of 14 top hits with functional measurements using electrophysiological methods reveals seven ligands, including five activators and two inhibitors. For example, aminooxetane-3-carboxylate is a more efficient activator than any other known ASCT2 natural or unnatural substrate. Furthermore, two of the hits inhibited ASCT2 mediated glutamine uptake and proliferation of a melanoma cancer cell line. Our results improve our understanding of how substrate specificity is determined in amino acid transporters, as well as provide novel scaffolds for developing chemical tools targeting ASCT2, an emerging therapeutic target for cancer and neurological disorders.","[Colas, Claire; Shere, Helen; Schlessinger, Avner] Icahn Sch Med Mt Sinai, Tisch Canc Inst, Dept Pharmacol & Syst Therapeut, New York, NY 10029 USA; [Grewer, Christof; Gameiro, Armanda; Albers, Thomas; Singh, Kurnvir] SUNY Binghamton, Dept Chem, Binghamton, NY USA; [Otte, Nicholas James; Holst, Jeff] Origins Canc Lab, Centenary Program, Camperdown, NSW, Australia; [Otte, Nicholas James; Holst, Jeff] Univ Sydney, Sydney Med Sch, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia; [Bonomi, Massimiliano] Univ Cambridge, Dept Chem, Cambridge CB2 1EW, England","Colas, C (reprint author), Icahn Sch Med Mt Sinai, Tisch Canc Inst, Dept Pharmacol & Syst Therapeut, New York, NY 10029 USA.",j.holst@centenary.org.au; avner.schlessinger@mssm.edu,"Holst, Jeff/H-7634-2012","Holst, Jeff/0000-0002-0377-9318; Bonomi, Massimiliano/0000-0002-7321-0004; Colas, Claire/0000-0001-6703-9186",National Institutes of Health [R01 GM108911]; National Breast Cancer Foundation of Australia Fellowship [ECF-12-05]; Movember through the Prostate Cancer Foundation of Australia (MRTA1),"This study was supported by a grant from the National Institutes of Health (http://www.nih.gov) (R01 GM108911) to AS, CC and CG.

This is partially driven by the need to engage with interdisciplinary science, access innovative approaches to problem solving, and acquire expertise beyond that which your own research group covers. It is also a great way to establish a worldwide network of colleagues with a variety of backgrounds-scientific, cultural, or otherwise. While international collaborations can be very rewarding, both professionally and from a personal perspective, they come with distinct difficulties and pitfalls that one should be aware of a priori. Nevertheless, cultivating an acute awareness of these issues will likely offer rich returns to internationally minded scientists, given that international research collaborations continue to expand, and many are now being established beyond the traditional power players, the North American and European research communities [1].","[de Grijs, Richard] Peking Univ, Kavli Inst Astron & Astrophys, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China","de Grijs, R (reprint author), Peking Univ, Kavli Inst Astron & Astrophys, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China.",grijs@pku.edu.cn,,"de Grijs, Richard/0000-0002-7203-5996",,,,11,3,3,1,12,PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE,SAN FRANCISCO,"1160 BATTERY STREET, STE 100, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94111 USA",1553-7358,,,PLOS COMPUT BIOL,PLoS Comput.

This makes mathematical model-based predictions of clinical outcome challenging. Our objective is to further understand differences in tumour progression and physiology between animal models and the clinic. To achieve that, we propose a mathematical model based upon tumour pathophysiology, where oxygen -as a surrogate for endocrine delivery-is our main focus. The Oxygen-Driven Model (ODM), using oxygen diffusion equations, describes tumour growth, hypoxia and necrosis. The ODM describes two key physiological parameters. Apparent oxygen uptake rate (k(R)') represents the amount of oxygen cells seem to need to proliferate. The more oxygen they appear to need, the more the oxygen transport. k(R)' gathers variability from the vasculature, stroma and tumour morphology. Proliferating rate (k(p)) deals with cell line specific factors to promote growth. The K-H,K-N describe the switch of hypoxia and necrosis. Retrospectively, using archived data, we looked at longitudinal tumour volume datasets for 38 xenografted cell lines and 5 patient-derived xenograft-like models. Exploration of the parameter space allows us to distinguish 2 groups of parameters. Group 1 of cell lines shows a spread in values of k(R)' and lower kp, indicating that tumours are poorly perfused and slow growing. Group 2 share the value of the oxygen uptake rate (k(R)') and vary greatly in kp, which we interpret as having similar oxygen transport, but more tumour intrinsic variability in growth. However, the ODM has some limitations when tested in explant-like animal models, whose complex tumour-stromal morphology may not be captured in the current version of the model. Incorporation of stroma in the ODM will help explain these discrepancies. We have provided an example. The ODM is a very simple - and versatile-model suitable for the design of preclinical experiments, which can be modified and enhanced whilst maintaining confidence in its predictions.","[Delgado-SanMartin, Juan A.; Yates, James W.

In cells with turgor, pressure opposes membrane deformations, and increases the amount of force that has to be generated by the endocytic machinery. To determine this force, and calculate the shape of the membrane, we used physical theory to model an elastic surface under pressure. Accurate fits of experimental profiles are obtained assuming that the coated membrane is highly rigid and preferentially curved at the endocytic site. The forces required from the actin machinery peaks at the onset of deformation, indicating that once invagination has been initiated, endocytosis is unlikely to stall before completion. Coat proteins do not lower the initiation force but may affect the process by the curvature they induce. In the presence of isotropic curvature inducers, pulling the tip of the invagination can trigger the formation of a neck at the base of the invagination. Hence direct neck constriction by actin may not be required, while its pulling role is essential. Finally, the theory shows that anisotropic curvature effectors stabilize membrane invaginations, and the loss of crescent-shaped BAR domain proteins such as Rvs167 could therefore trigger membrane scission.","[Dmitrieff, Serge; Nedelec, Francois] European Mol Biol Lab, Cell Biol & Biophys Unit, Heidelberg, Germany","Dmitrieff, S (reprint author), European Mol Biol Lab, Cell Biol & Biophys Unit, Heidelberg, Germany.",nedelec@embl.de,"Nedelec, Francois/H-3317-2011","Nedelec, Francois/0000-0002-8141-5288; Dmitrieff, Serge/0000-0002-1362-5670","European Molecular Biology Laboratory; Centre for modelling in the biosciences; European Commission Seventh Framework Programme [241548, 258068]","This work was funded by: European Molecular Biology Laboratory; Centre for modelling in the biosciences (www.bioms.de); and European Commission Seventh Framework Programme under grant agreements no. 241548 and 258068.

The pattern depends on mutual feedback between auxin and cytokinins mediated by the PIN class of auxin efflux transporters and AHP6, an inhibitor of cytokinin signalling. This interaction has been proposed to regulate the size and the position of the hormones' respective signalling domains and specify distinct boundaries between them. To understand the dynamics of this regulatory network, we implemented a parsimonious computational model of auxin transport that considers hormonal regulation of the auxin transporters within a spatial context, explicitly taking into account cell shape and polarity and the presence of cell walls. Our analysis reveals that an informative spatial pattern in cytokinin levels generated by diffusion is a theoretically unlikely scenario. Furthermore, our model shows that such a pattern is not required for correct and robust auxin patterning. Instead, auxin-dependent modifications of cytokinin response, rather than variations in cytokinin levels, allow for the necessary feedbacks, which can amplify and stabilise the auxin maximum. Our simulations demonstrate the importance of hormonal regulation of auxin efflux for pattern robustness. While involvement of the PIN proteins in vascular patterning is well established, we predict and experimentally verify a role of AUX1 and LAX1/2 auxin influx transporters in this process. Furthermore, we show that polar localisation of PIN1 generates an auxin flux circuit that not only stabilises the accumulation of auxin within the xylem axis, but also provides a mechanism for auxin to accumulate specifically in the xylem-pole pericycle cells, an important early step in lateral root initiation. The model also revealed that pericycle cells on opposite xylem poles compete for auxin accumulation, consistent with the observation that lateral roots are not initiated opposite to each other.","[el-Showk, Sedeer; Help-Rinta-Rahko, Hanna; Blomster, Tiina; Siligato, Riccardo; Mahonen, Ari Pekka] Univ Helsinki, Inst Biotechnol, Helsinki, Finland; [el-Showk, Sedeer; Maree, Athanasius F.

Cell components (e.g. cell membranes, cell cytoskeleton, cell nucleus) and extracellular matrix (e.g. collagen) are represented using collections of particles. Simple particle to particle interaction laws are used to simulate and control complex physical interaction types (e.g. cell-cell adhesion via cadherins, integrin basement membrane attachment, cytoskeletal mechanical properties). Particles may be given the capacity to change their properties and behaviours in response to changes in the cellular microenvironment (e.g., in response to cell-cell signalling or mechanical loadings). Each particle is in effect an 'agent', meaning that the agent can sense local environmental information and respond according to predetermined or stochastic events. The behaviour of the proposed framework is exemplified through several biological problems of ongoing interest. These examples illustrate how the modelling framework allows enormous flexibility for representing the mechanical behaviour of different tissues, and we argue this is a more intuitive approach than perhaps offered by traditional continuum methods. Because of this flexibility, we believe the discrete modelling framework provides an avenue for biologists and bioengineers to explore the behaviour of tissue systems in a computational laboratory.","[Gardiner, Bruce S.] Murdoch Univ, Sch Informat Technol & Engn, Perth, WA, Australia; [Wong, Kelvin K.

It bears promise to identify the driving forces behind the observed community patterns and whether community assembly happens deterministically. Advances in Next Generation Sequencing allow large community profiling studies, exceeding sequencing data output of conventional methods in scale by orders of magnitude. However, appropriate collection systems are still in a nascent state. We here present a database of 20,427 diverse environmental 16S rRNA profiles from 2,426 independent studies, which forms the foundation of our meta-analysis. We conducted a sample size adaptive all-against-all beta diversity comparison while also respecting phylogenetic relationships of Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs). After conventional hierarchical clustering we systematically test for enrichment of Environmental Ontology terms and their abstractions in all possible clusters. This post-hoc algorithm provides a novel formalism that quantifies to what extend compositional and semantic similarity of microbial community samples coincide. We automatically visualize significantly enriched subclusters on a comprehensive dendrogram of microbial communities. As a result we obtain the hitherto most differentiated and comprehensive view on global patterns of microbial community diversity. We observe strong clusterability of microbial communities in ecosystems such as human/mammal-associated, geothermal, fresh water, plant-associated, soils and rhizosphere microbiomes, whereas hypersaline and anthropogenic samples are less homogeneous. Moreover, saline samples appear less cohesive in terms of compositional properties than previously reported.","[Henschel, Andreas; Anwar, Muhammad Zohaib; Manohar, Vimitha] Masdar Inst, Inst Ctr Smart Infrastruct iSmart, Dept Elect Engn & Comp Sci, Abu Dhabi, U Arab Emirates","Henschel, A (reprint author), Masdar Inst, Inst Ctr Smart Infrastruct iSmart, Dept Elect Engn & Comp Sci, Abu Dhabi, U Arab Emirates.",ahenschel@masdar.ac.ae,,"Anwar, Muhammad Zohaib/0000-0001-8236-485X","Masdar Institute Research [11CAMA2, 13XAAA2]","This work was funded through Masdar Institute Research grants 11CAMA2 and 13XAAA2.

Dysfunction of ZAP-70 causes selective T cell deficiency that in turn results in persistent infections. ZAP-70 is activated by a variety of signals including phosphorylation of the kinase domain (KD), and binding of its regulatory tandem Src homology 2 (SH2) domains to the T cell receptor. The present study investigates molecular mechanisms of activation and inhibition of ZAP-70 via atomically detailed molecular dynamics simulation approaches. We report microsecond timescale simulations of five distinct states of the ZAP-70 KD, comprising apo, inhibited and three phosphorylated variants. Extensive analysis of local flexibility and correlated motions reveal crucial transitions between the states, thus elucidating crucial steps in the activation mechanism of the ZAP-70 KD. Furthermore, we rationalize previously observed staurosporine-bound crystal structures, suggesting that whilst the KD superficially resembles an ""active-like"" conformation, the inhibitor modulates the underlying protein dynamics and restricts it in a compact, rigid state inaccessible to ligands or cofactors. Finally, our analysis reveals a novel, potentially druggable pocket in close proximity to the activation loop of the kinase, and we subsequently use its structure in fragment-based virtual screening to develop a pharmacophore model. The pocket is distinct from classical type I or type II kinase pockets, and its discovery offers promise in future design of specific kinase inhibitors, whilst mutations in residues associated with this pocket are implicated in immunodeficiency in humans.","[Huber, Roland G.; Fan, Hao; Bond, Peter J.] Agcy Sci Technol & Res, Bioinformat Inst BII, Singapore, Singapore; [Fan, Hao; Bond, Peter J.] Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Biol Sci, Singapore 117548, Singapore","Huber, RG (reprint author), Agcy Sci Technol & Res, Bioinformat Inst BII, Singapore, Singapore.",peterjb@bii.a-star.edu.sg,,"Bond, Peter/0000-0003-2900-098X; Huber, Roland/0000-0001-5093-5988",,,,35,4,4,0,6,PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE,SAN FRANCISCO,"1160 BATTERY STREET, STE 100, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94111 USA",1553-734X,1553-7358,,PLOS COMPUT BIOL,PLoS Comput.

Despite difference in the anatomy or functions of neuronal circuits containing inhibition, two basic motifs repeatedly emerge: feed-forward and feedback. In the locust, it was proposed that a subset of lateral horn interneurons (LHNs), provide feed-forward inhibition onto Kenyon cells (KCs) to maintain their sparse firing-a property critical for olfactory learning and memory. But recently it was established that a single inhibitory cell, the giant GABAergic neuron (GGN), is the main and perhaps sole source of inhibition in the mushroom body, and that inhibition from this cell is mediated by a feedback (FB) loop including KCs and the GGN. To clarify basic differences in the effects of feedback vs. feed-forward inhibition in circuit dynamics we here use a model of the locust olfactory system. We found both inhibitory motifs were able to maintain sparse KCs responses and provide optimal odor discrimination. However, we further found that only FB inhibition could create a phase response consistent with data recorded in vivo. These findings describe general rules for feed-forward versus feedback inhibition and suggest GGN is potentially capable of providing the primary source of inhibition to the KCs. A better understanding of how inhibitory motifs impact post-synaptic neuronal activity could be used to reveal unknown inhibitory structures within biological networks.","[Kee, Tiffany; Sanda, Pavel; Bazhenov, Maxim] Univ Calif Riverside, Dept Cell Biol & Neurosci, Riverside, CA 92521 USA; [Gupta, Nitin] Indian Inst Technol, Dept Biol Sci & Bioengn, Kanpur 208016, Uttar Pradesh, India; [Stopfer, Mark] NICHHD, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA","Kee, T (reprint author), Univ Calif Riverside, Dept Cell Biol & Neurosci, Riverside, CA 92521 USA.",Maksim.Bazhenov@ucr.edu,"Sanda, Pavel/S-7791-2017","Stopfer, Mark/0000-0001-9200-1884; Gupta, Nitin/0000-0002-8408-3848","National Institute of Health, National Institute of Deafness and other Communication Disorders [1 R01 DC012943]","This work was funded by the National Institute of Health, National Institute of Deafness and other Communication Disorders, 1 R01 DC012943, http://www.nidcd.nih.gov/Pages/default.aspx to MB.

It is therefore possible that they are generated by similar underlying mechanisms. Previously, the response properties of a collision-sensitive neuron were reproduced by a model which used a power law for scaling its inhibitory input. A common characteristic of such neurons is that they integrate information across a large part of the visual field. Here we present a biophysically plausible model of collision-sensitive neurons with.-like response properties, in which we assume that each information channel is noisy and has a response threshold. Then, an approximative power law is obtained as a result of pooling these channels. We show that with this mechanism one can successfully predict many response characteristics of the Lobula GiantMovement Detector Neuron (LGMD). Moreover, the results depend critically on noise in the inhibitory pathway, but they are fairly robust against noise in the excitatory pathway.","[Keil, Matthias S.] Univ Barcelona, Basic Psychol Dept, Barcelona, Spain; [Keil, Matthias S.] Univ Barcelona, Inst Brain Bahav & Cognit I3C, Barcelona, Spain","Keil, MS (reprint author), Univ Barcelona, Basic Psychol Dept, Barcelona, Spain.",matskeil@ub.edu,,,"Spanish Government; Retencion de Talent program from the University of Barcelona; National Research [DPI2010-21513, PSI2013-41568-P, 2014 SGR 79]","MSK was supported by a Ramon and Cajal Grant from the Spanish Government and the Retencion de Talent program from the University of Barcelona, as well as the National Research Grants DPI2010-21513, PSI2013-41568-P, and 2014 SGR 79.

The catalytic mechanism of BACE-1 requires water-mediated proton transfer from aspartyl dyad to the substrate, as well as structural flexibility in the flap region. Thus, the coupling of protonation and conformational equilibria is essential to a full in silico characterization of BACE-1. In this work, we perform constant pH replica exchange molecular dynamics simulations on both apo BACE-1 and five BACE-1-inhibitor complexes to examine the effect of pH on dynamics and inhibitor binding properties of BACE-1. In our simulations, we find that solution pH controls the conformational flexibility of apo BACE-1, whereas bound inhibitors largely limit the motions of the holo enzyme at all levels of pH. The microscopic pKa values of titratable residues in BACE-1 including its aspartyl dyad are computed and compared between apo and inhibitor-bound states. Changes in protonation between the apo and holo forms suggest a thermodynamic linkage between binding of inhibitors and protons localized at the dyad. Utilizing our recently developed computational protocol applying the binding polynomial formalism to the constant pH molecular dynamics (CpHMD) framework, we are able to obtain the pH-dependent binding free energy profiles for various BACE-1-inhibitor complexes. Our results highlight the importance of correctly addressing the binding-induced protonation changes in protein-ligand systems where binding accompanies a net proton transfer. This work comprises the first application of our CpHMD-based free energy computational method to protein-ligand complexes and illustrates the value of CpHMD as an all-purpose tool for obtaining pH-dependent dynamics and binding free energies of biological systems.","[Kim, M.

Here, we introduce a novel, machine-learning based classification methodology, which we call perturbation expectation-maximization (pEM), that simultaneously analyzes a population of protein trajectories to uncover the system of diffusive behaviors which collectively result from distinct biochemical interactions. We validate the performance of pEM in silico and demonstrate that pEM is capable of uncovering the proper number of underlying diffusive states with an accurate characterization of their diffusion properties. We then apply pEM to experimental protein trajectories of Rho GTPases, an integral regulator of cytoskeletal dynamics and cellular homeostasis, in vivo via single particle tracking photo-activated localization microcopy. Remarkably, pEM uncovers 6 distinct diffusive states conserved across various Rho GTPase family members. The variability across family members in the propensities for each diffusive state reveals non-redundant roles in the activation states of RhoA and RhoC. In a resting cell, our results support a model where RhoA is constantly cycling between activation states, with an imbalance of rates favoring an inactive state. RhoC, on the other hand, remains predominantly inactive.","[Koo, Peter K.] Yale Univ, Dept Phys, New Haven, CT 06511 USA; [Weitzman, Matthew; van Golen, Kenneth L.; Mochrie, Simon G.

This strategy is based on the incorporation of the 'CamTube' force field into the Gromacs molecular dynamics package. By considering the case of a 60-residue polyvaline chain, we show that CamTube molecular dynamics simulations can comprehensively explore the conformational space of proteins. We obtain this result by a 20 mu s metadynamics simulation of the polyvaline chain that recapitulates the currently known protein fold universe. We further show that, if residue-specific interaction potentials are added to the CamTube force field, it is possible to fold a protein into a topology close to that of its native state.

Such bursting has important consequences for cellfate decisions in diverse processes ranging from HIV-1 viral infections to stem-cell differentiation. It is generally assumed that bursts are geometrically distributed and that they arrive according to a Poisson process. On the other hand, recent single-cell experiments provide evidence for complex burst arrival processes, highlighting the need for analysis of more general stochastic models. To address this issue, we invoke a mapping between general stochastic models of gene expression and systems studied in queueing theory to derive exact analytical expressions for the moments associated with mRNA/protein steady-state distributions. These results are then used to derive noise signatures, i. e. explicit conditions based entirely on experimentally measurable quantities, that determine if the burst distributions deviate from the geometric distribution or if burst arrival deviates from a Poisson process. For non-Poisson arrivals, we develop approaches for accurate estimation of burst parameters. The proposed approaches can lead to new insights into transcriptional bursting based on measurements of steady-state mRNA/protein distributions.","[Kumar, Niraj; Kulkarni, Rahul V.] Univ Massachusetts, Dept Phys, Boston, MA 02125 USA; [Singh, Abhyudai] Univ Delaware, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Newark, DE USA","Kumar, N (reprint author), Univ Massachusetts, Dept Phys, Harbor Campus, Boston, MA 02125 USA.",rahul.kulkarni@umb.edu,,,"NSF [PHY 1307067, DMS 1413111, DMS-1312926]","This work was funded by: NSF PHY 1307067 URL: http://www.nsf.gov; NSF DMS 1413111 URL: http://www.nsf.gov; and NSF DMS-1312926 URL: http://www.nsf.gov.

If prior knowledge, acquired from learning a set of objects is only transferable to new objects that share properties with the old, then the recognition system's optimal organization must be one containing specialized modules for different object classes. Our analysis starts from a premise we call the invariance hypothesis: that the computational goal of the ventral stream is to compute an invariant-to-transformations and discriminative signature for recognition. The key condition enabling approximate transfer of invariance without sacrificing discriminability turns out to be that the learned and novel objects transform similarly. This implies that the optimal recognition system must contain subsystems trained only with data from similarly-transforming objects and suggests a novel interpretation of domain-specific regions like the fusiform face area (FFA). Furthermore, we can define an index of transformation-compatibility, computable from videos, that can be combined with information about the statistics of natural vision to yield predictions for which object categories ought to have domain-specific regions in agreement with the available data. The result is a unifying account linking the large literature on view-based recognition with the wealth of experimental evidence concerning domain-specific regions.","[Leibo, Joel Z.; Liao, Qianli; Anselmi, Fabio; Poggio, Tomaso] MIT, Ctr Brains Minds & Machines, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Leibo, Joel Z.; Liao, Qianli; Anselmi, Fabio; Poggio, Tomaso] MIT, McGovern Inst Brain Res, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Anselmi, Fabio; Poggio, Tomaso] Ist Italiano Tecnol, Genoa, Italy","Leibo, JZ (reprint author), MIT, Ctr Brains Minds & Machines, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",jzleibo@mit.edu,,"Anselmi, Fabio/0000-0002-0264-4761","Center for Brains, Minds, and Machines (CBMM) - NSF STC [CCF-1231216]; National Science Foundation [NSF-0640097, NSF-0827427]; Air Force Office of Scientific Research AFOSR-THRL [FA8650-05-C-7262]; Eugene McDermott Foundation","This material is based upon work supported by the Center for Brains, Minds, and Machines (CBMM), funded by NSF STC award CCF-1231216.

Yet, the viral dynamics involved in such escape are incompletely understood. Previous analyses have made several strong assumptions regarding HIV escape from CTL responses such as independent or non-concurrent escape from individual CTL responses. Using experimental data from evolution of HIV half genomes in four patients we observe concurrent viral escape from multiple CTL responses during early infection (first 100 days of infection), providing confirmation of a recent result found in a study of one HIV-infected patient. We show that current methods of estimating CTL escape rates, based on the assumption of independent escapes, are biased and perform poorly when CTL escape proceeds concurrently at multiple epitopes. We propose a new method for analyzing longitudinal sequence data to estimate the rate of CTL escape across multiple epitopes; this method involves few parameters and performs well in simulation studies. By applying our novel method to experimental data, we find that concurrent multiple escapes occur at rates between 0.03 and 0.4 day(-1), a relatively broad range that reflects uncertainty due to sparse sampling and wide ranges of parameter values. However, we show that concurrent escape at rates 0.1-0.2 day(-1) across multiple epitopes is consistent with our patient datasets.","[Leviyang, Sivan] Georgetown Univ, Dept Math & Stat, Washington, DC 20057 USA; [Ganusov, Vitaly V.] Univ Tennessee, Dept Microbiol, Knoxville, TN 37996 USA","Leviyang, S (reprint author), Georgetown Univ, Dept Math & Stat, Washington, DC 20057 USA.",sr286@georgetown.edu,,"Ganusov, Vitaly/0000-0001-6572-1691",National Science Foundation [DMS-1225601]; National Institute for Mathematical and Biological Synthesis; American Heart Association,"This work was supported by the National Science Foundation (www.nsf.gov) grant DMS-1225601 (SL), a National Institute for Mathematical and Biological Synthesis (www.nimbios.org) short-term visitor fellowship (SL and VVG), and the American Heart Association (www.heart.org) (VVG).

This gain-of-function enhancement of IP3R activity is considered to be the main reason behind the upregulation of intracellular Ca2+ signaling in the presence of optimal and suboptimal stimuli and spontaneous Ca2+ signals observed in cells expressing mutant PS. In this paper, we employed computational modeling of single IP3R channel activity records obtained under optimal Ca2+ and multiple IP3 concentrations to gain deeper insights into the enhancement of IP3R function. We found that in addition to the high occupancy of the high-activity (H) mode and the low occupancy of the low-activity (L) mode, IP3R in FAD-causing mutant PS-expressing cells exhibits significantly longer mean life-time for the H mode and shorter lifetime for the L mode, leading to shorter mean close-time and hence high open probability of the channel in comparison to IP3R in cells expressing wild-type PS. The model is then used to extrapolate the behavior of the channel to a wide range of IP3 and Ca2+ concentrations and quantify the sensitivity of IP3R to its two ligands. We show that the gain-of-function enhancement is sensitive to both IP3 and Ca2+ and that very small amount of IP3 is required to stimulate IP3R channels in the presence of FAD-causing mutant PS to the same level of activity as channels in control cells stimulated by significantly higher IP3 concentrations. We further demonstrate with simulations that the relatively longer time spent by IP3R in the H mode leads to the observed higher frequency of local Ca2+ signals, which can account for the more frequent global Ca2+ signals observed, while the enhanced activity of the channel at extremely low ligand concentrations will lead to spontaneous Ca2+ signals in cells expressing FAD-causing mutant PS.","[Mak, Don-On Daniel; Foskett, J.

In addition to studying the network interactions, there is much interest in utilizing single cell scale data to elucidate the non-random aspects of the variability involved in cellular decision making. Previous studies have considered the information transfer between the signaling and transcriptional domains based on an instantaneous relationship between the molecular activities. These studies predict a limited binary on/off encoding mechanism which underestimates the complexity of biological information processing, and hence the utility of single cell resolution data. Here we pursue a novel strategy that reformulates the information transfer problem as involving dynamic features of signaling rather than molecular abundances. We pursue a computational approach to test if and how the transcriptional regulatory activity patterns can be informative of the temporal history of signaling. Our analysis reveals (1) the dynamic features of signaling that significantly alter transcriptional regulatory patterns (encoding), and (2) the temporal history of signaling that can be inferred from single cell scale snapshots of transcriptional activity (decoding). Immediate early gene expression patterns were informative of signaling peak retention kinetics, whereas transcription factor activity patterns were informative of activation and deactivation kinetics of signaling. Moreover, the information processing aspects varied across the network, with each component encoding a selective subset of the dynamic signaling features. We developed novel sensitivity and information transfer maps to unravel the dynamic multiplexing of signaling features at each of these network components. Unsupervised clustering of the maps revealed two groups that aligned with network motifs distinguished by transcriptional feedforward vs feedback interactions. Our new computational methodology impacts the single cell scale experiments by identifying downstream snapshot measures required for inferring specific dynamical features of upstream signals involved in the regulation of cellular responses.","[Makadia, Hirenkumar K.; Schwaber, James S.; Vadigepalli, Rajanikanth] Thomas Jefferson Univ, Daniel Baugh Inst Funct Genom & Computat Biol, Dept Pathol Anat & Cell Biol, Sidney Kimmel Med Coll, Philadelphia, PA 19107 USA","Makadia, HK (reprint author), Thomas Jefferson Univ, Daniel Baugh Inst Funct Genom & Computat Biol, Dept Pathol Anat & Cell Biol, Sidney Kimmel Med Coll, Philadelphia, PA 19107 USA.",Rajanikanth.Vadigepalli@jefferson.edu,,"Makadia, Hirenkumar/0000-0002-6511-8099","National Institutes of Health (NIH) [R01 GM083108, R01 HL111621]","This study was supported by National Institutes of Health (NIH) grants R01 GM083108 and R01 HL111621.

Interleukin-8 (IL-8), a key modulator of neutrophil function, signals through neutrophil specific surface receptors CXCR-1 and CXCR-2. In this study a mechanistic computational model was used to evaluate and deploy an extracorporeal sepsis treatment which modulates CXCR-1/2 levels. First, a simplified mechanistic computational model of IL-8 mediated activation of CXCR-1/2 receptors was developed, containing 16 ODEs and 43 parameters. Receptor level dynamics and systemic parameters were coupled with multiple neutrophil phenotypes to generate dynamic populations of activated neutrophils which reduce pathogen load, and/or primed neutrophils which cause adverse tissue damage when misdirected. The mathematical model was calibrated using experimental data from baboons administered a two-hour infusion of E coli and followed for a maximum of 28 days. Ensembles of parameters were generated using a Bayesian parallel tempering approach to produce model fits that could recreate experimental outcomes. Stepwise logistic regression identified seven model parameters as key determinants of mortality. Sensitivity analysis showed that parameters controlling the level of killer cell neutrophils affected the overall systemic damage of individuals. To evaluate rescue strategies and provide probabilistic predictions of their impact on mortality, time of onset, duration, and capture efficacy of an extracorporeal device that modulated neutrophil phenotype were explored. Our findings suggest that interventions aiming to modulate phenotypic composition are time sensitive. When introduced between 3-6 hours of infection for a 72 hour duration, the survivor population increased from 31% to 40-80%. Treatment efficacy quickly diminishes if not introduced within 15 hours of infection. Significant harm is possible with treatment durations ranging from 5-24 hours, which may reduce survival to 13%. In severe sepsis, an extracorporeal treatment which modulates CXCR-1/2 levels has therapeutic potential, but also potential for harm. Further development of the computational model will help guide optimal device development and determine which patient populations should be targeted by treatment.","[Malkin, Alexander D.; Federspiel, William J.] Univ Pittsburgh, McGowan Inst Regenerat Med, Pittsburgh, PA 15260 USA; [Malkin, Alexander D.; Federspiel, William J.] Univ Pittsburgh, Dept Bioengn, Pittsburgh, PA USA; [Sheehan, Robert P.] Univ Pittsburgh, Dept Computat & Syst Biol, Pittsburgh, PA USA; [Mathew, Shibin; Federspiel, William J.] Univ Pittsburgh, Dept Chem & Petr Engn, Pittsburgh, PA 15261 USA; [Federspiel, William J.] Univ Pittsburgh, Dept Surg, Pittsburgh, PA USA; [Redl, Heinz] AUVA Ctr, Ludwig Boltzmann Inst Expt & Clin Traumatol, Vienna, Austria; [Clermont, Gilles] Univ Pittsburgh, Dept Crit Care Med, CRISMA Ctr, Pittsburgh, PA USA","Malkin, AD (reprint author), Univ Pittsburgh, McGowan Inst Regenerat Med, Pittsburgh, PA 15260 USA.",malkina@upmc.edu,,,"National Institutes of Health [GM105728-02, T32 EB009403, T32 HL076124]; Gerald E.

In stems and coleoptiles, classic experiments showed that the peak region of a pulse of radio-labelled auxin moves at a roughly constant velocity down a stem or coleoptile segment. As the pulse moves it becomes broader, at a roughly constant rate. It is shown here that this 'spreading rate' is larger than can be accounted for by a single channel model, but can be explained by coupling of channels with differing polar transport rates. An extreme case is where strongly polar channels are coupled to completely apolar channels, in which case auxin in the apolar part is 'dragged along' by the polar part in a somewhat diffuse distribution. The behaviour of this model is explored, together with others that can account for the experimentally observed spreading rates. It is also shown that saturation of carriers involved in lateral transport can explain the characteristic shape of pulses that result from uptake of large amounts of auxin.","Univ Cambridge, Sainsbury Lab, Cambridge, England","Mitchison, G (reprint author), Univ Cambridge, Sainsbury Lab, Cambridge, England.",gjm12@cam.ac.uk,,,,,,57,6,6,0,9,PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE,SAN FRANCISCO,"1160 BATTERY STREET, STE 100, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94111 USA",1553-734X,1553-7358,,PLOS COMPUT BIOL,PLoS Comput.

For large protein complexes such as GroEL/GroES with more than 8,000 residues, obtaining a fine-grained all-atom description of its normal mode motions can be computationally prohibitive and is often unnecessary. For this reason, coarse-grained models have been used successfully. However, most existing coarse-grained models use extremely simple potentials to represent the interactions within the coarse-grained structures and as a result, the dynamics obtained for the coarse-grained structures may not always be fully realistic. There is a gap between the quality of the dynamics of the coarse-grained structures given by all-atom models and that by coarse-grained models. In this work, we resolve an important question in protein dynamics computations-how can we efficiently construct coarse-grained models whose description of the dynamics of the coarse-grained structures remains as accurate as that given by all-atom models? Our method takes advantage of the sparseness of the Hessian matrix and achieves a high efficiency with a novel iterative matrix projection approach. The result is highly significant since it can provide descriptions of normal mode motions at an all-atom level of accuracy even for the largest biomolecular complexes. The application of our method to GroEL/GroES offers new insights into the mechanism of this biologically important chaperonin, such as that the conformational transitions of this protein complex in its functional cycle are even more strongly connected to the first few lowest frequency modes than with other coarse-grained models.","[Na, Hyuntae; Song, Guang] Iowa State Univ, Dept Comp Sci, Ames, IA 50011 USA; [Jernigan, Robert L.] Iowa State Univ, Dept Biochem Biophys & Mol Biol, Ames, IA USA; [Jernigan, Robert L.; Song, Guang] Iowa State Univ, Program Bioinformat & Computat Biol, Ames, IA USA; [Jernigan, Robert L.; Song, Guang] Iowa State Univ, LH Baker Ctr Bioinformat & Biol Stat, Ames, IA USA","Na, H (reprint author), Iowa State Univ, Dept Comp Sci, Ames, IA 50011 USA.",gsong@iastate.edu,,,National Science Foundation [CCF-0953517]; National Institute of Health [R01-GM72014],"This work was funded by: National Science Foundation, CCF-0953517, www.nsf.gov,to GS; and National Institute of Health, R01-GM72014, www.nih.gov, to RLJ.

Consequently, the proposed algorithm does not propagate detection errors and naturally integrates in a ""big data"" workflow used for large-scale analyses.

Modeling realistically behaving cells in tissues is computationally challenging because it implies dealing with multiple levels of complexity. We extend the Cellular Potts Model with an actin-inspired feedback mechanism that allows small stochastic cell rufflings to expand to cell protrusions. This simple phenomenological model produces realistically crawling and deforming amoeboid cells, and gliding half-moon shaped keratocyte-like cells. Both cell types can migrate randomly or follow directional cues. They can squeeze in between other cells in densely populated environments or migrate collectively. The model is computationally light, which allows the study of large, dense and heterogeneous tissues containing cells with realistic shapes and migratory properties.","[Niculescu, Ioana; Textor, Johannes; de Boer, Rob J.] Univ Utrecht, Theoret Biol & Bioinformat, NL-3508 TC Utrecht, Netherlands","Niculescu, I (reprint author), Univ Utrecht, Theoret Biol & Bioinformat, NL-3508 TC Utrecht, Netherlands.",I.Niculescu@uu.nl,"de Boer, Rob/B-6050-2011; Textor, Johannes/E-1792-2016","de Boer, Rob/0000-0002-2130-691X; Textor, Johannes/0000-0002-0459-9458",Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research (NWO) [912.10.066]; German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD),"IN and JT were supported by The Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research (NWO) grant No. 912.10.066 (to RJdB).

The power and utility of these models is increased when tumor samples from multiple sites are sequenced. Temporal ordering of the samples may provide insight into the etiology of both primary and metastatic lesions and rationalizations for tumor recurrence and therapeutic failures. Additional insights may be provided by temporal ordering of evolving subclones-cellular subpopulations with unique mutational profiles. Current methods for subclone hierarchy inference tightly couple the problem of temporal ordering with that of estimating the fraction of cancer cells harboring each mutation. We present a new framework that includes a rigorous statistical hypothesis test and a collection of tools that make it possible to decouple these problems, which we believe will enable substantial progress in the field of subclone hierarchy inference. The methods presented here can be flexibly combined with methods developed by others addressing either of these problems. We provide tools to interpret hypothesis test results, which inform phylogenetic tree construction, and we introduce the first genetic algorithm designed for this purpose. The utility of our framework is systematically demonstrated in simulations. For most tested combinations of tumor purity, sequencing coverage, and tree complexity, good power (>= 0.8) can be achieved and Type 1 error is well controlled when at least three tumor samples are available from a patient. Using data from three published multi-region tumor sequencing studies of (murine) small cell lung cancer, acute myeloid leukemia, and chronic lymphocytic leukemia, in which the authors reconstructed subclonal phylogenetic trees by manual expert curation, we show how different configurations of our tools can identify either a single tree in agreement with the authors, or a small set of trees, which include the authors' preferred tree. Our results have implications for improved modeling of tumor evolution and the importance of multi-region tumor sequencing.","[Niknafs, Noushin; Beleva-Guthrie, Violeta; Karchin, Rachel] Johns Hopkins Univ, Dept Biomed Engn, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA; [Niknafs, Noushin; Beleva-Guthrie, Violeta; Karchin, Rachel] Johns Hopkins Univ, Inst Computat Med, Baltimore, MD USA; [Naiman, Daniel Q.] Johns Hopkins Univ, Dept Appl Math & Stat, Baltimore, MD USA; [Karchin, Rachel] Johns Hopkins Med Inst, Dept Oncol, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA","Niknafs, N (reprint author), Johns Hopkins Univ, Dept Biomed Engn, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA.",karchin@jhu.edu,,,National Cancer Institute [R01CA179991],"This work was supported by funds from National Cancer Institute R01CA179991 to NN.

We have developed a technique to overcome this limitation that entails modification of force field parameters to reduce a few pairwise non-bonded interactions between selected atoms of the probe molecules and bilayer lipids. We used the resulting technique, termed pMD-membrane, to identify allosteric ligand binding sites on the G12D and G13D oncogenic mutants of the K-Ras protein bound to a negatively charged lipid bilayer.

This method, called SiComPre (Simulation based Complex Prediction), achieves better qualitative prediction of yeast and human protein complexes than existing methods and is the first to predict protein complex abundances. Furthermore, we show that SiComPre can be used to predict complexome changes upon drug treatment with the example of bortezomib. SiComPre is the first method to produce quantitative predictions on the abundance of molecular complexes while performing the best qualitative predictions. With new data on tissue specific protein complexes becoming available SiComPre will be able to predict qualitative and quantitative differences in the complexome in various tissue types and under various conditions.","[Rizzetto, Simone; Priami, Corrado] Univ Trento, Ctr Computat Syst Biol, Microsoft Res, Rovereto, Italy; [Priami, Corrado] Univ Trento, Dept Math, Povo, TN, Italy; [Csikasz-Nagy, Attila] Fdn Edmund Mach, Dept Computat Biol, Res & Innovat Ctr, San Michele All Adige, Italy; [Csikasz-Nagy, Attila] Kings Coll London, Randall Div Cell & Mol Biophys, London WC2R 2LS, England; [Csikasz-Nagy, Attila] Kings Coll London, Inst Math & Mol Biomed, London WC2R 2LS, England","Rizzetto, S (reprint author), Univ Trento, Ctr Computat Syst Biol, Microsoft Res, Rovereto, Italy.",priami@cosbi.eu; attila.csikasz-nagy@kcl.ac.uk,"Rizzetto, Simone/O-6311-2015; Csikasz-Nagy, Attila/A-3487-2009","Rizzetto, Simone/0000-0003-3881-8759; Csikasz-Nagy, Attila/0000-0002-2919-5601",Microsoft Research - University of Trento Centre for Computational and Systems Biology,"This work was internally funded by The Microsoft Research - University of Trento Centre for Computational and Systems Biology.

Because such paths are curves in a high-dimensional space, it has been difficult to quantitatively compare multiple paths, a necessary prerequisite to, for instance, assess the quality of different algorithms. We introduce a method named Path Similarity Analysis (PSA) that enables us to quantify the similarity between two arbitrary paths and extract the atomic-scale determinants responsible for their differences. PSA utilizes the full information available in 3N-dimensional configuration space trajectories by employing the Hausdorff or Frechet metrics (adopted from computational geometry) to quantify the degree of similarity between piecewise-linear curves. It thus completely avoids relying on projections into low dimensional spaces, as used in traditional approaches. To elucidate the principles of PSA, we quantified the effect of path roughness induced by thermal fluctuations using a toy model system. Using, as an example, the closed-to-open transitions of the enzyme adenylate kinase (AdK) in its substrate-free form, we compared a range of protein transition path-generating algorithms. Molecular dynamics-based dynamic importance sampling (DIMS) MD and targeted MD (TMD) and the purely geometric FRODA (Framework Rigidity Optimized Dynamics Algorithm) were tested along with seven other methods publicly available on servers, including several based on the popular elastic network model (ENM). PSA with clustering revealed that paths produced by a given method are more similar to each other than to those from another method and, for instance, that the ENM-based methods produced relatively similar paths. PSA applied to ensembles of DIMS MD and FRODA trajectories of the conformational transition of diphtheria toxin, a particularly challenging example, showed that the geometry-based FRODA occasionally sampled the pathway space of force field-based DIMS MD. For the AdK transition, the new concept of a Hausdorff-pair map enabled us to extract the molecular structural determinants responsible for differences in pathways, namely a set of conserved salt bridges whose charge-charge interactions are fully modelled in DIMS MD but not in FRODA. PSA has the potential to enhance our understanding of transition path sampling methods, validate them, and to provide a new approach to analyzing conformational transitions.","[Seyler, Sean L.; Kumar, Avishek; Thorpe, M.

Unfortunately, the determination of detailed atomic structures for all these functionally important conformational states with conventional high-resolution approaches is often difficult and unsuccessful. In some cases, biophysical and biochemical approaches can provide important complementary structural information that can be exploited with the help of advanced computational methods to derive structural models of specific conformational states. In particular, functional and spectroscopic measurements in combination with site-directed mutations constitute one important source of information to obtain these mixed-resolution structural models. A very common problem with this strategy, however, is the difficulty to simultaneously integrate all the information from multiple independent experiments involving different mutations or chemical labels to derive a unique structural model consistent with the data. To resolve this issue, a novel restrained molecular dynamics structural refinement method is developed to simultaneously incorporate multiple experimentally determined constraints (e.g., engineered metal bridges or spin-labels), each treated as an individual molecular fragment with all atomic details. The internal structure of each of the molecular fragments is treated realistically, while there is no interaction between different molecular fragments to avoid unphysical steric clashes. The information from all the molecular fragments is exploited simultaneously to constrain the backbone to refine a three-dimensional model of the conformational state of the protein. The method is illustrated by refining the structure of the voltage-sensing domain (VSD) of the Kv1.2 potassium channel in the resting state and by exploring the distance histograms between spin-labels attached to T4 lysozyme. The resulting VSD structures are in good agreement with the consensus model of the resting state VSD and the spin-spin distance histograms from ESR/DEER experiments on T4 lysozyme are accurately reproduced.","[Shen, Rong; Islam, Shahidul M.; Roux, Benoit] Univ Chicago, Dept Biochem & Mol Biol, Gordon Ctr Integrat Sci, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Han, Wei; Schulten, Klaus] Univ Illinois, Beckman Inst, Urbana, IL USA; [Fiorin, Giacomo] Temple Univ, Inst Computat Mol Sci, Philadelphia, PA 19122 USA","Shen, R (reprint author), Univ Chicago, Dept Biochem & Mol Biol, Gordon Ctr Integrat Sci, 920 E 58Th St, Chicago, IL 60637 USA.",roux@uchicago.edu,"Shen, Rong/O-2026-2019",,"National Institute of Health (NIH) [U54-GM087519, P41-RR005969, R01-GM067887]; Computation Institute; Biological Sciences Division of the University of Chicago; Argonne National Laboratory through NIH [1S10OD018495]; NSF TeraGrid resources [TG-MCA01S018]","This work was carried out in the context of the Membrane Protein Structural Dynamics Consortium, which is funded by grant U54-GM087519 from the National Institute of Health (NIH).

However, robustness often coexists with its counterpart, evolvability-the ability of perturbations to generate new phenotypes. Previous models of gene regulatory network evolution have shown that robustness evolves under stabilizing selection, but it is unclear how robustness and evolvability will emerge in common coevolutionary scenarios. We consider a two-species model of coevolution involving one host and one parasite population. By using two interacting species, key model parameters that determine the fitness landscapes become emergent properties of the model, avoiding the need to impose these parameters externally. In our study, parasites are modeled on species such as cuckoos where mimicry of the host phenotype confers high fitness to the parasite but lower fitness to the host. Here, frequent phenotype changes are favored as each population continually adapts to the other population. Sensitivity evolves at the network level such that point mutations can induce large phenotype changes. Crucially, the sensitive points of the network are broadly distributed throughout the network and continually relocate. Each time sensitive points in the network are mutated, new ones appear to take their place. We have therefore named this phenomenon ""whack-alpha-mole"" sensitivity, after a popular fun park game. We predict that this type of sensitivity will evolve under conditions of strong directional selection, an observation that helps interpret existing experimental evidence, for example, during the emergence of bacterial antibiotic resistance.","[Shin, Jeewoen; MacCarthy, Thomas] SUNY Stony Brook, Dept Appl Math & Stat, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA; [MacCarthy, Thomas] SUNY Stony Brook, Laufer Ctr Phys & Quantitat Biol, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA","Shin, J (reprint author), SUNY Stony Brook, Dept Appl Math & Stat, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA.",thomas.maccarthy@stonybrook.edu,,,National Institutes of Health [1R01GM111741-01A1],"This study was supported by National Institutes of Health grant 1R01GM111741-01A1 to TM.

Obtaining atomistic insight is challenging in particular, given the transient nature of the chaperone-substrate complexes and the large system sizes. Recent single-molecule experiments have shown that the chaperone Trigger Factor (TF) not only binds unfolded protein chains, but can also guide protein chains to their native state by interacting with partially folded structures. Here, we used all-atom MD simulations to provide atomistic insights into how Trigger Factor achieves this chaperone function. Our results indicate a crucial role for the tips of the finger-like appendages of TF in the early interactions with both unfolded chains and partially folded structures. Unfolded chains are kinetically trapped when bound to TF, which suppresses the formation of transient, non-native end-to-end contacts. Mechanical flexibility allows TF to hold partially folded structures with two tips (in a pinching configuration), and to stabilize them by wrapping around its appendages. This encapsulation mechanism is distinct from that of chaperones such as GroEL, and allows folded structures of diverse size and composition to be protected from aggregation and misfolding interactions. The results suggest that an ATP cycle is not required to enable both encapsulation and liberation.","[Singhal, Kushagra; Vreede, Jocelyne; Bolhuis, Peter G.] Univ Amsterdam, vant Hoff Inst Mol Sci, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Mashaghi, Alireza; Tans, Sander J.] FOM Inst AMOLF, Dept Syst Biophys, Amsterdam, Netherlands","Singhal, K (reprint author), Univ Amsterdam, vant Hoff Inst Mol Sci, Amsterdam, Netherlands.",p.g.bolhuis@uva.nl,"Bolhuis, Peter/K-6115-2015; Mashaghi, Alireza/Q-8218-2017","Bolhuis, Peter/0000-0002-3698-9258; Mashaghi, Alireza/0000-0002-2157-1211",NWO VICI [700.58.442],"This work was funded by NWO VICI grant 700.58.442; url: http://www.nwo.nl.

Thus, we hypothesize that analysis of the dynamics of the complex can reveal details about the nature of the interaction, and in particular whether it is obligatory, i.e., persists throughout the entire lifetime of the proteins, or not. Indeed, normal mode analysis, using the Gaussian network model, shows that for the most part obligatory and non-obligatory complexes differ in their decomposition into dynamic domains, i.e., the mobile elements of the protein complex. The dynamic domains of obligatory complexes often mix segments from the interacting chains, and the hinges between them do not overlap with the interface between the chains. In contrast, in non-obligatory complexes the interface often hinges between dynamic domains, held together through few anchor residues on one side of the interface that interact with their counterpart grooves in the other end. In automatic analysis, 117 of 139 obligatory (84.2%) and 203 of 246 non-obligatory (82.5%) complexes are correctly classified by our method: DynaFace.

However, the parasite persists in human populations at levels of considerable rarity and as such the existence of animal reservoirs has been posited. Clarifying the impact of animal host reservoirs on the feasibility of interrupting sleeping sickness transmission through interventions is a matter of urgency. We developed a mathematical model allowing for heterogeneous exposure of humans to tsetse, with animal populations that differed in their ability to transmit infections, to investigate the effectiveness of two established techniques, screening and treatment of at-risk populations, and vector control. Importantly, under both assumptions, an integrated approach of human screening and vector control was supported in high transmission areas. However, increasing the intensity of vector control was more likely to eliminate transmission, while increasing the intensity of human screening reduced the time to elimination. Non-human animal hosts played important, but different roles in HAT transmission, depending on whether or not they contributed as reservoirs. If they did not serve as reservoirs, sensitivity analyses suggested their attractiveness may instead function as a sink for tsetse bites. These outcomes highlight the importance of understanding the ecological and environmental context of sleeping sickness in optimizing integrated interventions, particularly for moderate and low transmission intensity settings.","[Stone, Chris M.; Chitnis, Nakul] Swiss Trop & Publ Hlth Inst, Dept Epidemiol & Publ Hlth, Basel, Switzerland; [Stone, Chris M.; Chitnis, Nakul] Univ Basel, Basel, Switzerland","Stone, CM (reprint author), N Carolina State Univ, Dept Stat, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA.",chrism.stone@gmail.com,"Chitnis, Nakul/B-3105-2013","Stone, Christopher/0000-0001-9535-2583","Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation [OPP1037660]; RAPIDD program of the Science & Technology Directorate, Department of Homeland Security; Fogarty International Center, National Institutes of Health, USA","CS and NC were supported by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation through grant number OPP1037660.

This situation was recently analyzed using Pareto optimality, showing that tradeoffs between tasks lead to phenotypes distributed on low dimensional polygons in trait space. The vertices of these polygons are archetypes-phenotypes optimal at a single task. This theory was applied to examples from animal morphology and gene expression. Here we ask whether Pareto optimality theory can apply to life history traits, which include longevity, fecundity and mass. To comprehensively explore the geometry of life history trait space, we analyze a dataset of life history traits of 2105 endothermic species. We find that, to a first approximation, life history traits fall on a triangle in log-mass log-longevity space. The vertices of the triangle suggest three archetypal strategies, exemplified by bats, shrews and whales, with specialists near the vertices and generalists in the middle of the triangle. To a second approximation, the data lies in a tetrahedron, whose extra vertex above the mass-longevity triangle suggests a fourth strategy related to carnivory. Each animal species can thus be placed in a coordinate system according to its distance from the archetypes, which may be useful for genome-scale comparative studies of mammalian aging and other biological aspects. We further demonstrate that Pareto optimality can explain a range of previous studies which found animal and plant phenotypes which lie in triangles in trait space. This study demonstrates the applicability of multi-objective optimization principles to understand life history traits and to infer archetypal strategies that suggest why some mammalian species live much longer than others of similar mass.","[Szekely, Pablo; Korem, Yael; Mayo, Avi; Alon, Uri] Weizmann Inst Sci, Dept Mol Cell Biol, IL-76100 Rehovot, Israel; [Moran, Uri] Weizmann Inst Sci, Dept Plant Sci, IL-76100 Rehovot, Israel","Szekely, P (reprint author), Weizmann Inst Sci, Dept Mol Cell Biol, IL-76100 Rehovot, Israel.",uri.alon@weizmann.ac.il,"mayo, avi/N-3756-2019","mayo, avi/0000-0002-4479-3423",European Research Council (FP7)/ERC [249919]; Israel Science Foundation,"U.A. is the incumbent of the Abisch-Frenkel Professorial Chair.

Intriguingly, these mechanisms are observed to be very similar to those implicated in the acquisition of an important degree of immunity against metazoan parasites (helminths and arthropods) in mammalian hosts. Based on the hypothesis that IgE-mediated immune responses evolved in mammals to provide extra protection against metazoan parasites rather than to cause allergy, we predict that the environmental allergens will share key properties with the metazoan parasite antigens that are specifically targeted by IgE in infected human populations. We seek to test this prediction by examining if significant similarity exists between molecular features of allergens and helminth proteins that induce an IgE response in the human host. By employing various computational approaches, 2712 unique protein molecules that are known IgE antigens were searched against a dataset of proteins from helminths and parasitic arthropods, resulting in a comprehensive list of 2445 parasite proteins that show significant similarity through sequence and structure with allergenic proteins. Nearly half of these parasite proteins from 31 species fall within the 10 most abundant allergenic protein domain families (EF-hand, Tropomyosin, CAP, Profilin, Lipocalin, Trypsin-like serine protease, Cupin, BetV1, Expansin and Prolamin). We identified epitopic-like regions in 206 parasite proteins and present the first example of a plant protein (BetV1) that is the commonest allergen in pollen in a worm, and confirming it as the target of IgE in schistosomiasis infected humans. The identification of significant similarity, inclusive of the epitopic regions, between allergens and helminth proteins against which IgE is an observed marker of protective immunity explains the 'off-target' effects of the IgE-mediated immune system in allergy. All these findings can impact the discovery and design of molecules used in immunotherapy of allergic conditions.","[Tyagi, Nidhi; Thornton, Janet M.] EMBL European Bioinformat Inst, Cambridge, England; [Farnell, Edward J.; Fitzsimmons, Colin M.; Dunne, David W.] Univ Cambridge, Dept Pathol, Cambridge CB2 1QP, England; [Ryan, Stephanie; Maizels, Rick M.] Univ Edinburgh, Inst Immunol & Infect Res, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland; [Tukahebwa, Edridah] Minist Hlth, Vector Control Div, Kampala, Uganda; [Furnham, Nicholas] London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, London WC1, England","Tyagi, N (reprint author), EMBL European Bioinformat Inst, Wellcome Trust Genome Campus, Cambridge, England.",tyagi@ebi.ac.uk,,"Dunne, David/0000-0002-8940-9886; Farnell, Edward/0000-0001-5996-7345; Thornton, Janet/0000-0003-0824-4096; Tyagi, Nidhi/0000-0002-2065-9051","Wellcome Trust [WT094317MA, WT 083931/Z/07/Z, WT 094317/Z/10/Z, 094317, 090281, MR/K020420/1]; European Commission FP7-CP-IP-SICA scheme [242107]; Medical Research Council [MR/K020420/1]","This work was funded by Wellcome Trust (http://www.wellcome.ac.uk/) grant WT094317MA to NT, Wellcome Trust (http://www.wellcome.ac.uk/) programme grant WT 083931/Z/07/Z to DWD, Wellcome Trust (http://www.wellcome.ac.uk/) WT 094317/Z/10/Z and European Commission (http://ec.europa.eu/index_en.htm) FP7-CP-IP-SICA scheme grant 242107 to EF and CF, Wellcome Trust grant 094317 to DWD, RMM and JT and 090281 to SR and MRC (http://www.mrc.ac.uk), funding MR/K020420/1 to NF.

Understanding the echolocation capabilities of bats comes down to isolating the minimal set of acoustic cues needed to complete each task. For some tasks, the minimal cues have already been identified. However, while a number of possible cues have been suggested, little is known about the minimal cues supporting obstacle avoidance in echolocating bats. In this paper, we propose that the Interaural Intensity Difference (IID) and travel time of the first millisecond of the echo train are sufficient cues for obstacle avoidance. We describe a simple control algorithm based on the use of these cues in combination with alternating ear positions modeled after the constant frequency bat Rhinolophus rouxii. Using spatial simulations (2D and 3D), we show that simple phonotaxis can steer a bat clear from obstacles without performing a reconstruction of the 3D layout of the scene. As such, this paper presents the first computationally explicit explanation for obstacle avoidance validated in complex simulated environments. Based on additional simulations modelling the FM bat Phyllostomus discolor, we conjecture that the proposed cues can be exploited by constant frequency (CF) bats and frequency modulated (FM) bats alike. We hypothesize that using a low level yet robust cue for obstacle avoidance allows bats to comply with the hard real-time constraints of this basic behaviour.","[Vanderelst, Dieter; Peremans, Herbert] Univ Antwerp, Act Percept Lab, B-2020 Antwerp, Belgium; [Vanderelst, Dieter; Holderied, Marc W.] Univ Bristol, Sch Biol Sci, Bristol, Avon, England","Vanderelst, D (reprint author), Univ Antwerp, Act Percept Lab, B-2020 Antwerp, Belgium.",dieter.vanderelst@uantwerpen.be,"Holderied, Marc/M-9382-2013","Holderied, Marc/0000-0002-1573-7908",Flemish Fund For Scientific Research; Marie Curie IEF fellowship,"DV was supported by a postdoctoral grant from the Flemish Fund For Scientific Research and a Marie Curie IEF fellowship.

Substrate uptake at the atomic level and the mechanism of ion gradient conversion into directional transport remained enigmatic. We observed in repeated simulations that two local structural changes regulated transport. The first change led to formation of the transient Na2 sodium binding site, triggered by side chain rotation of T308. The second change destabilized cytoplasmic ionic interactions. We found that sodium binding to the transiently formed Na2 site energized substrate uptake through reshaping of the energy hypersurface.

The development of fast algorithms is paramount to allow large-scale simulations. The Gillespie algorithm can be used for fast simulation of stochastic processes, and variants of it have been applied to simulate dynamical processes on static networks. However, its adaptation to temporal networks remains non-trivial. We here present a temporal Gillespie algorithm that solves this problem. Our method is applicable to general Poisson (constant-rate) processes on temporal networks, stochastically exact, and up to multiple orders of magnitude faster than traditional simulation schemes based on rejection sampling. We also show how it can be extended to simulate non-Markovian processes. The algorithm is easily applicable in practice, and as an illustration we detail how to simulate both Poissonian and non-Markovian models of epidemic spreading. Namely, we provide pseudocode and its implementation in C++ for simulating the paradigmatic Susceptible- Infected-Susceptible and Susceptible- Infected-Recovered models and a Susceptible- Infected-Recovered model with non-constant recovery rates. For empirical networks, the temporal Gillespie algorithm is here typically from 10 to 100 times faster than rejection sampling.","[Vestergaard, Christian L.; Genois, Mathieu] Univ Toulon & Var, Aix Marseille Univ, CNRS, CPT,UMR 7332, Marseille, France","Vestergaard, CL (reprint author), Univ Toulon & Var, Aix Marseille Univ, CNRS, CPT,UMR 7332, Marseille, France.",cvestergaard@gmail.com,,"Vestergaard, Christian L./0000-0001-5329-475X; Genois, Mathieu/0000-0001-5492-8750",EU FET project MULTIPLEX [317532]; French ANR HARMS-flu [ANR-12-MONU-0018],"This work was supported by the EU FET project MULTIPLEX 317532 to CLV and the French ANR HARMS-flu, ANR-12-MONU-0018 to MG.

Biofilms are less susceptible to host inflammatory and immune responses and have higher antibiotic tolerance than free-living planktonic cells. Developing treatments against biofilms requires an understanding of bacterial biofilm-specific physiological traits. Research efforts have started to elucidate the intricate mechanisms underlying biofilm development. However, many aspects of these mechanisms are still poorly understood. Here, we addressed questions regarding biofilm metabolism using a genome-scale kinetic model of the P. aeruginosa metabolic network and gene expression profiles. Specifically, we computed metabolite concentration differences between known mutants with altered biofilm formation and the wild-type strain to predict drug targets against P. aeruginosa biofilms. We also simulated the altered metabolism driven by gene expression changes between biofilm and stationary growth-phase planktonic cultures. Our analysis suggests that the synthesis of important biofilm-related molecules, such as the quorumsensing molecule Pseudomonas quinolone signal and the exopolysaccharide Psl, is regulated not only through the expression of genes in their own synthesis pathway, but also through the biofilm-specific expression of genes in pathways competing for precursors to these molecules. Finally, we investigated why mutants defective in anthranilate degradation have an impaired ability to form biofilms. Alternative to a previous hypothesis that this biofilm reduction is caused by a decrease in energy production, we proposed that the dysregulation of the synthesis of secondary metabolites derived from anthranilate and chorismate is what impaired the biofilms of these mutants. Notably, these insights generated through our kinetic model-based approach are not accessible from previous constraint-based model analyses of P. aeruginosa biofilm metabolism. Our simulation results showed that plausible, non-intuitive explanations of difficult-to-interpret experimental observations could be generated by integrating genome-scale kinetic models with gene expression profiles.","[Vital-Lopez, Francisco G.; Reifman, Jaques; Wallqvist, Anders] US Army Med Res & Mat Command, Dept Def Biotechnol High Performance Comp Softwar, Telemed & Adv Technol Res Ctr, Ft Detrick, MD USA","Vital-Lopez, FG (reprint author), US Army Med Res & Mat Command, Dept Def Biotechnol High Performance Comp Softwar, Telemed & Adv Technol Res Ctr, Ft Detrick, MD USA.",jaques.reifman.civ@mail.mil,,"wallqvist, anders/0000-0002-9775-7469","U.S. Army Network Science Initiative; U.S. Army Medical Research and Materiel Command, Fort Detrick, MD","The authors were supported by the U.S. Army Network Science Initiative, U.S. Army Medical Research and Materiel Command, Fort Detrick, MD (http://mrmc.amedd.army.mil).

We also calculated the k(on) rate constant for superoxide dismutase with its natural substrate, O-2(-), in a validation of a previous experiment using similar methods but with a number of important improvements. We also calculated the k(on) for a new system: the N-terminal domain of Troponin C with its natural substrate Ca2+. The k(on) calculated for the latter two systems closely resemble experimentally obtained values. This novel multiscale approach is computationally cheaper and more parallelizable when compared to other methods of similar accuracy.

We describe a paradigm shift currently under way in computer graphics towards the use of more realistic global illumination models, and we apply the so-called ambient occlusion approach to our opensource multi-scale modeling program, Sculptor. While there are many other higher quality global illumination approaches going all the way up to full GPU-accelerated ray tracing, they do not provide size-specificity of the features they shade. Ambient occlusion is an aspect of global lighting that offers great visual benefits and powerful user customization. By estimating how other molecular shape features affect the reception of light at some surface point, it effectively simulates indirect shadowing. This effect occurs between molecular surfaces that are close to each other, or in pockets such as protein or ligand binding sites. By adding ambient occlusion, large macromolecular systems look much more natural, and the perception of characteristic surface features is strongly enhanced. In this work, we present a realtime implementation of screen space ambient occlusion that delivers realistic cues about tunable spatial scale characteristics of macromolecular architecture. Heretofore, the visualization of large biomolecular systems, comprising e.g. hundreds of thousands of atoms or Mega-Dalton size electron microscopy maps, did not take into account the length scales of interest or the spatial resolution of the data. Our approach has been uniquely customized with shading that is tuned for pockets and cavities of a user-defined size, making it useful for visualizing molecular features at multiple scales of interest. This is a feature that none of the conventional ambient occlusion approaches provide. Actual Sculptor screen shots illustrate how our implementation supports the size-dependent rendering of molecular surface features.","[Wahle, Manuel] Univ Texas Hlth Sci Ctr Houston, Sch Biomed Informat, Houston, TX 77030 USA; [Wriggers, Willy] Old Dominion Univ, Dept Mech & Aerosp Engn, Norfolk, VA USA","Wahle, M (reprint author), Einstein & Montefiore, Block Inst Clin & Translat Res, Bronx, NY 10461 USA.",wriggers@biomachina.org,,"Wriggers, Willy/0000-0001-5326-3152",National Institute of General Medical Sciences (US) [R01GM62968],"This work was supported by National Institute of General Medical Sciences (US), URL http://www.nigms.nih.gov, grant number R01GM62968 (to WW).

ApoE4 is known to be the strongest risk factor for AD onset, while ApoE3 and ApoE2 are considered to be the AD-neutral and AD-protective isoforms, respectively. It has been hypothesized that the ApoE isoforms may contribute to the development of AD by modifying the homeostasis of ApoE physiological partners and AD-related proteins in an isoform-specific fashion. Here we find that, despite the high sequence similarity among the three ApoE variants, only ApoE4 exhibits a misfolded intermediate state characterized by isoform-specific domain-domain interactions in molecular dynamics simulations. The existence of an ApoE4-specific intermediate state can contribute to the onset of AD by altering multiple cellular pathways involved in ApoE-dependent lipid transport efficiency or in AD-related protein aggregation and clearance. We present what we believe to be the first structural model of an ApoE4 misfolded intermediate state, which may serve to elucidate the molecular mechanism underlying the role of ApoE4 in AD pathogenesis. The knowledge of the structure for the ApoE4 folding intermediate provides a new platform for the rational design of alternative therapeutic strategies to fight AD.","[Williams, Benfeard, II; Convertino, Marino; Das, Jhuma; Dokholyan, Nikolay V.] Univ N Carolina, Dept Biochem & Biophys, Chapel Hill, NC USA","Williams, B (reprint author), Univ N Carolina, Dept Biochem & Biophys, Chapel Hill, NC USA.",dokh@unc.edu,"Dokholyan, Nikolay/D-8081-2018","Dokholyan, Nikolay/0000-0002-8225-4025","National Institutes of Health [5R25GM055336, R01GM080742]","This work was supported by the National Institutes of Health (nih.gov) award 5R25GM055336 to BW and grant R01GM080742 to NVD.

Although integration of sensory feedback with internal motor programs is important for sequence generation, if and how feedback contributes to repetitive actions is poorly understood. Here we study how auditory feedback contributes to generating repetitive syllable sequences in songbirds. We propose that auditory signals provide positive feedback to ongoing motor commands, but this influence decays as feedback weakens from response adaptation during syllable repetitions. Computational models show that this mechanism explains repeat distributions observed in Bengalese finch song. We experimentally confirmed two predictions of this mechanism in Bengalese finches: removal of auditory feedback by deafening reduces syllable repetitions; and neural responses to auditory playback of repeated syllable sequences gradually adapt in sensory-motor nucleus HVC. Together, our results implicate a positive auditory-feedback loop with adaptation in generating repetitive vocalizations, and suggest sensory adaptation is important for feedback control of motor sequences.","[Wittenbach, Jason D.; Jin, Dezhe Z.] Penn State Univ, Dept Phys, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; [Wittenbach, Jason D.; Jin, Dezhe Z.] Penn State Univ, Ctr Neural Engn, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; [Bouchard, Kristofer E.; Brainard, Michael S.] Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Physiol, San Francisco, CA USA; [Bouchard, Kristofer E.; Brainard, Michael S.] Univ Calif San Francisco, Ctr Integrat Neurosci, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; [Bouchard, Kristofer E.] Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Neurosurg, San Francisco, CA USA; [Bouchard, Kristofer E.] Univ Calif San Francisco, Ctr Neural Engn & Prosthesis, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; [Brainard, Michael S.] Univ Calif San Francisco, Howard Hughes Med Inst, San Francisco, CA USA","Wittenbach, JD (reprint author), Penn State Univ, Dept Phys, 104 Davey Lab, University Pk, PA 16802 USA.",dzj2@psu.edu,,"Brainard, Michael/0000-0002-9425-9907","National Science Foundation [IOS-0827731, IOS-0951348]; Huck Institute of the Life Sciences at the Pennsylvania State University [R01 DC006636]; Howard Hughes Medical Institute; Graduate Research Fellowship Program","This work was supported by the National Science Foundation http://www.nsf.gov/, IOS-0827731 (DZJ); The Huck Institute of the Life Sciences at the Pennsylvania State University, https://www.huck.psu.edu/, (DZJ); National Institutes of Health, http://www.nih.gov/, R01 DC006636 (MSB); National Science Foundation, http://www.nsf.gov/, IOS-0951348 (MSB); The Howard Hughes Medical Institute, https://www.hhmi.org/, (MSB); and the National Science Foundation, http://www.nsf.gov/, Graduate Research Fellowship Program (KEB).

This work presents a simulation method to directly study the equilibrium of multiple states. This method constructs a virtual mixture of multiple states (VMMS) to sample the conformational space of all chemical states simultaneously. The VMMS system consists of multiple subsystems, one for each state. The subsystem contains a solute and a solvent environment. The solute molecules in all subsystems share the same conformation but have their own solvent environments. Transition between states is implicated by the change of their molar fractions. Simulation of a VMMS system allows efficient calculation of relative free energies of all states, which in turn determine their equilibrium molar fractions. For systems with a large number of state transition sites, an implicit site approximation is introduced to minimize the cost of simulation. A direct application of the VMMS method is for constant pH simulation to study protonation equilibrium. Applying the VMMS method to a heptapeptide of 3 ionizable residues, we calculated the pKas of those residues both with all explicit states and with implicit sites and obtained consistent results. For mouse epidermal growth factor of 9 ionizable groups, our VMMS simulations with implicit sites produced pKas of all 9 ionizable groups and the results agree qualitatively with NMR measurement. This example demonstrates the VMMS method can be applied to systems of a large number of ionizable groups and the computational cost scales linearly with the number of ionizable groups. For one of the most challenging systems in constant pH calculation, SNase Delta+PHS/V66K, our VMMS simulation shows that it is the state-dependent water penetration that causes the large deviation in lysine66's pKa.","[Wu, Xiongwu; Brooks, Bernard R.] NHLBI, Lab Computat Biol, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA","Wu, XW (reprint author), NHLBI, Lab Computat Biol, NIH, Bldg 10, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA.",wuxw@nhlbi.nih.gov,,,"Intramural Research Programs of National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute [Z01 HL001027-30]","This research was supported by the Intramural Research Programs of National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (Z01 HL001027-30).

Advancements in next generation sequencing enabled genome-wide profiling of protein-DNA interactions by chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by high throughput sequencing (ChIP-seq). However, interactions in highly repetitive regions of genomes have proven difficult to map since short reads of 50-100 base pairs (bps) from these regions map to multiple locations in reference genomes. Standard analytical methods discard such multi-mapping reads and the few that can accommodate them are prone to large false positive and negative rates. We developed Perm-seq, a prior-enhanced read allocation method for ChIP-seq experiments, that can allocate multi-mapping reads in highly repetitive regions of the genomes with high accuracy. We comprehensively evaluated Perm-seq, and found that our prior-enhanced approach significantly improves multi-read allocation accuracy over approaches that do not utilize additional data types. The statistical formalism underlying our approach facilitates supervising of multi-read allocation with a variety of data sources including histone ChIP-seq. We applied Perm-seq to 64 ENCODE ChIP-seq datasets from GM12878 and K562 cells and identified many novel protein-DNA interactions in segmental duplication regions. Our analysis reveals that although the protein-DNA interactions sites are evolutionarily less conserved in repetitive regions, they share the overall sequence characteristics of the protein-DNA interactions in non-repetitive regions.","[Zeng, Xin; Welch, Rene; Rojo, Constanza; Zheng, Ye; Keles, Sunduz] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Stat, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Li, Bo] Univ Calif Berkeley, Calif Inst Quantitat Biosci, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Dewey, Colin N.; Keles, Sunduz] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Biostat & Med Informat, Madison, WI USA","Zeng, X (reprint author), Univ Wisconsin, Dept Stat, Madison, WI 53706 USA.",keles@stat.wisc.edu,,"Welch, Rene/0000-0001-9861-530X","National Institutes of Health [HG003747, U01 HG007019]","This work was supported by the National Institutes of Health grants HG003747 (SK) and U01 HG007019 (SK and CND).

We tested Collage by prioritizing bacterial response genes in Dictyostelium as a novel model system for prokaryote-eukaryote interactions. Using 4 seed genes and 14 data sets, only one of which was directly related to the bacterial response, Collage proposed 8 candidate genes that were readily validated as necessary for the response of Dictyostelium to Gram-negative bacteria.

Existing HGT detection algorithms rely on a strong phylogenetic signal distinguishing the transferred sequence from ancestral (vertically derived) genes in its recipient genome. Detecting HGT between closely related species or strains is challenging, as the phylogenetic signal is usually weak and the nucleotide composition is normally nearly identical. Nevertheless, there is a great importance in detecting HGT between congeneric species or strains, especially in clinical microbiology, where understanding the emergence of new virulent and drug-resistant strains is crucial, and often time-sensitive. We developed a novel, self-contained technique named Near HGT, based on the synteny index, to measure the divergence of a gene from its native genomic environment and used it to identify candidate HGT events between closely related strains. The method confirms candidate transferred genes based on the constant relative mutability (CRM). Using CRM, the algorithm assigns a confidence score based on ""unusual"" sequence divergence. A gene exhibiting exceptional deviations according to both synteny and mutability criteria, is considered a validated HGT product. We first employed the technique to a set of three E. coli strains and detected several highly probable horizontally acquired genes. We then compared the method to existing HGT detection tools using a larger strain data set. When combined with additional approaches our new algorithm provides richer picture and brings us closer to the goal of detecting all newly acquired genes in a particular strain.","[Adato, Orit; Ninyo, Noga; Snir, Sagi] Univ Haifa, Dept Evolutionary Biol, IL-31999 Haifa, Israel; [Gophna, Uri] Tel Aviv Univ, Dept Mol Microbiol & Biotechnol, IL-69978 Tel Aviv, Israel","Adato, O (reprint author), Univ Haifa, Dept Evolutionary Biol, IL-31999 Haifa, Israel.",ssagi@research.haifa.ac.il,,"Gophna, Uri/0000-0001-5129-5652",U.S.-Israel Binational Science Foundation; Israel Science foundation,"OA, NN and SS were supported by a grant from the U.S.-Israel Binational Science Foundation and a grant from the Israel Science foundation.

It has been central to a number of seminal studies, particularly in the context of HIV-1 and leukemia. However, there is a significant discrepancy between lymphocyte proliferation rates estimated in different studies. Notably, deuterated H-2(2)-glucose (D-2-glucose) labeling studies consistently yield higher estimates of proliferation than deuterated water (D2O) labeling studies. This hampers our understanding of immune function and undermines our confidence in this important technique. Whether these differences are caused by fundamental biochemical differences between the two compounds and/or by methodological differences in the studies is unknown. D-2-glucose and D2O labeling experiments have never been performed by the same group under the same experimental conditions; consequently a direct comparison of these two techniques has not been possible. We sought to address this problem. We performed both in vitro and murine in vivo labeling experiments using identical protocols with both D-2-glucose and D2O. This showed that intrinsic differences between the two compounds do not cause differences in the proliferation rate estimates, but that estimates made using D-2-glucose in vivo were susceptible to difficulties in normalization due to highly variable blood glucose enrichment. Analysis of three published human studies made using D-2-glucose and D2O confirmed this problem, particularly in the case of short term D-2-glucose labeling. Correcting for these inaccuracies in normalization decreased proliferation rate estimates made using D-2-glucose and slightly increased estimates made using D2O; thus bringing the estimates from the two methods significantly closer and highlighting the importance of reliable normalization when using this technique.","[Ahmed, Raya; Zhang, Yan; Kelly, Elizabeth; Reljic, Rajko; Macallan, Derek C.] Univ London, Inst Infect & Immun, London, England; [Westera, Liset; Drylewicz, Julia; Tesselaar, Kiki; Borghans, Jose A.

This ability, which is known as metacognition, is typically studied by asking people to report their confidence in the correctness of some decision. However, the computations underlying confidence reports remain unclear. In this paper, we present a fully Bayesian method for directly comparing models of confidence. Using a visual two-interval forced-choice task, we tested whether confidence reports reflect heuristic computations (e.g. the magnitude of sensory data) or Bayes optimal ones (i.e. how likely a decision is to be correct given the sensory data). In a standard design in which subjects were first asked to make a decision, and only then gave their confidence, subjects were mostly Bayes optimal. In contrast, in a less-commonly used design in which subjects indicated their confidence and decision simultaneously, they were roughly equally likely to use the Bayes optimal strategy or to use a heuristic but suboptimal strategy. Our results suggest that, while people's confidence reports can reflect Bayes optimal computations, even a small unusual twist or additional element of complexity can prevent optimality.","[Aitchison, Laurence; Latham, Peter E.] UCL, Gatsby Computat Neurosci Unit, London, England; [Bang, Dan] Univ Oxford, Dept Expt Psychol, Oxford OX1 3UD, England; [Bang, Dan] Univ Oxford, Calleva Res Ctr Evolut & Human Sci, Magdalen Coll, Oxford, England; [Bang, Dan; Bahrami, Bahador] Aarhus Univ, Interacting Minds Ctr, Aarhus, Denmark; [Bahrami, Bahador] UCL, Inst Cognit Neurosci, London, England","Aitchison, L (reprint author), UCL, Gatsby Computat Neurosci Unit, London, England.",laurence.aitchison@gmail.com,,"Bang, Dan/0000-0001-7446-7090",Gatsby Charitable Foundation; European Research Council Starting Grant [309865]; Calleva Research Centre for Evolution and Human Sciences,"LA and PEL are supported by the Gatsby Charitable Foundation.

Recent studies show that these proteins have common traits even at the monomer level. Among them, a polyglutamine region that is present in huntingtin is known to exhibit a correlation between the length of the chain and the severity as well as the earliness of the onset of Huntington disease. Here, we apply bias exchange molecular dynamics to generate structures of polyglutamine expansions of several lengths and characterize the resulting independent conformations. We compare the properties of these conformations to those of the standard proteins, as well as to other homopolymeric tracts. We find that, similar to the previously studied polyvaline chains, the set of possible transient folds is much broader than the set of known-to-date folds, although the conformations have different structures. We show that the mechanical stability is not related to any simple geometrical characteristics of the structures. We demonstrate that long polyglutamine expansions result in higher mechanical stability than the shorter ones. They also have a longer life span and are substantially more prone to form knotted structures. The knotted region has an average length of 35 residues, similar to the typical threshold for most polyglutamine-related diseases. Similarly, changes in shape and mechanical stability appear once the total length of the peptide exceeds this threshold of 35 glutamine residues.

Drugs can mimic genetic knock-out effects; therefore, our understanding of promiscuous drugs, polypharmacology-related adverse drug reactions, and multi-drug therapies, especially cancer combination therapy, may be informed by a deeper understanding of synthetic lethality. However, the colossal experimental burden in humans necessitates in silico methods to guide the identification of synthetic lethal pairs. Here, we present SINaTRA (Species-INdependent TRAnslation), a network-based methodology that discovers genome-wide synthetic lethality in translation between species. SINaTRA uses connectivity homology, defined as biological connectivity patterns that persist across species, to identify synthetic lethal pairs. Importantly, our approach does not rely on genetic homology or structural and functional similarity, and it significantly outperforms models utilizing these data. We validate SINaTRA by predicting synthetic lethality in S. pombe using S. cerevisiae data, then identify over one million putative human synthetic lethal pairs to guide experimental approaches.

Empirical data analyzed here indicate a certain hierarchy in local cortical composition. Specifically, neural wire, i.e., axons and dendrites take each about 1/3 of cortical space, spines and glia/astrocytes occupy each about (1/3) 2, and capillaries around (1/3)(4). Moreover, data analysis across species reveals that these fractions are roughly brain size independent, which suggests that they could be in some sense optimal and thus important for brain function. Is there any principle that sets them in this invariant way? This study first builds a model of local circuit in which neural wire, spines, astrocytes, and capillaries are mutually coupled elements and are treated within a single mathematical framework. Next, various forms of wire minimization rule (wire length, surface area, volume, or conduction delays) are analyzed, of which, only minimization of wire volume provides realistic results that are very close to the empirical cortical fractions. As an alternative, a new principle called ""spine economy maximization"" is proposed and investigated, which is associated with maximization of spine proportion in the cortex per spine size that yields equally good but more robust results. Additionally, a combination of wire cost and spine economy notions is considered as a meta-principle, and it is found that this proposition gives only marginally better results than either pure wire volume minimization or pure spine economy maximization, but only if spine economy component dominates. However, such a combined meta-principle yields much better results than the constraints related solely to minimization of wire length, wire surface area, and conduction delays. Interestingly, the type of spine size distribution also plays a role, and better agreement with the data is achieved for distributions with long tails. In sum, these results suggest that for the efficiency of local circuits wire volume may be more primary variable than wire length or temporal delays, and moreover, the new spine economy principle may be important for brain evolutionary design in a broader context.","Univ Warsaw, Inst Appl Math & Mech, Warsaw, Poland","Karbowski, J (reprint author), Univ Warsaw, Inst Appl Math & Mech, Warsaw, Poland.",jkarbowski@mimuw.edu.pl,,"Karbowski, Jan/0000-0001-5560-4723",,,,91,4,4,0,8,PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE,SAN FRANCISCO,"1160 BATTERY STREET, STE 100, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94111 USA",1553-734X,1553-7358,,PLOS COMPUT BIOL,PLoS Comput.

Crystal structures obtained from high-resolution X-ray diffraction data reflect this heterogeneity as a spatial and temporal conformational average. Although movement between natively populated alternative conformations can be critical for characterizing molecular mechanisms, it is challenging to identify these conformations within electron density maps. Alternative side chain conformations are generally well separated into distinct rotameric conformations, but alternative backbone conformations can overlap at several atomic positions. Our model building program qFit uses mixed integer quadratic programming (MIQP) to evaluate an extremely large number of combinations of sidechain conformers and backbone fragments to locally explain the electron density. Here, we describe two major modeling enhancements to qFit: peptide flips and alternative glycine conformations. We find that peptide flips fall into four stereotypical clusters and are enriched in glycine residues at the n+1 position. The potential for insights uncovered by new peptide flips and glycine conformations is exemplified by HIV protease, where different inhibitors are associated with peptide flips in the ""flap"" regions adjacent to the inhibitor binding site. Our results paint a picture of peptide flips as conformational switches, often enabled by glycine flexibility, that result in dramatic local rearrangements. Our results furthermore demonstrate the power of large-scale computational analysis to provide new insights into conformational heterogeneity. Overall, improved modeling of backbone heterogeneity with high-resolution X-ray data will connect dynamics to the structure-function relationship and help drive new design strategies for inhibitors of biomedically important systems.","[Keedy, Daniel A.; Fraser, James S.] Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Bioengn & Therapeut Sci, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; [van den Bedem, Henry] Stanford Univ, Div Biosci, SLAC Natl Accelerator Lab, Stanford, CA 94305 USA","Keedy, DA (reprint author), Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Bioengn & Therapeut Sci, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA.",vdbedem@slac.stanford.edu,,"Keedy, Daniel/0000-0002-9184-7586; Fraser, James/0000-0002-5080-2859; van den Bedem, Henry/0000-0003-2358-841X","NIH [OD009180, GM110580]; NSF [STC-1231306]","JSF is a Searle Scholar, Pew Scholar, and Packard Fellow, and is supported by NIH OD009180, NIH GM110580, and NSF STC-1231306.

Based on first principles, here we construct an individual-based, force-based computational model integrating four modules of 1) filopodia penetration dynamics; 2) intracellular mechanics of cellular and nuclear membranes, contractile actin stress fibers, and focal adhesion dynamics; 3) structural mechanics of ECM fiber networks; and 4) reaction-diffusion mass transfers of seven biochemical concentrations in related with chemotaxis, proteolysis, haptotaxis, and degradation in ECM to predict dynamic behaviors of filopodia that penetrate into a 3D ECM fiber network. The tip of each filopodium crawls along ECM fibers, tugs the surrounding fibers, and contracts or retracts depending on the strength of the binding and the ECM stiffness and pore size. This filopodium-ECM interaction is modeled as a stochastic process based on binding kinetics between integrins along the filopodial shaft and the ligands on the surrounding ECM fibers. This filopodia stochastic model is integrated into migratory dynamics of a whole cell in order to predict the cell invasion into 3D ECM in response to chemotaxis, haptotaxis, and durotaxis cues. Predicted average filopodia speed and that of the cell membrane advance agreed with experiments of 3D HUVEC migration at r(2) > 0.95 for diverse ECMs with different pore sizes and stiffness.","[Kim, Min-Cheol; Silberberg, Yaron R.; Kamm, Roger D.; Asada, H.

However, a critical and largely unanswered question is whether these models generalize from one choice context to another. Here we show that a model adapted from the perceptual decision-making domain and estimated on choices over food rewards accurately predicts choices and reaction times in four independent sets of subjects making social decisions.

Despite decades of research on interocular suppression and related phenomena (e.g., binocular rivalry, flash suppression, continuous flash suppression), the neural processing underlying interocular suppression is still unknown. We developed and tested a computational model of interocular suppression. The model included two processes that contributed to the strength of interocular suppression: divisive normalization and attentional modulation. According to the model, the salient competitor induced a stimulus-driven attentional modulation selective for the location and orientation of the competitor, thereby increasing the gain of neural responses to the competitor and reducing the gain of neural responses to the target. Additional suppression was induced by divisive normalization in the model, similar to other forms of visual masking. To test the model, we conducted psychophysics experiments in which both the size and the eye-of-origin of the competitor were manipulated. For small and medium competitors, behavioral performance was consonant with a change in the response gain of neurons that responded to the target. But large competitors induced a contrast-gain change, even when the competitor was split between the two eyes. The model correctly predicted these results and outperformed an alternative model in which the attentional modulation was eye specific. We conclude that both stimulus-driven attention (selective for location and feature) and divisive normalization contribute to interocular suppression.","[Li, Hsin-Hung; Carrasco, Marisa; Heeger, David J.] NYU, Dept Psychol, New York, NY 10003 USA; [Carrasco, Marisa; Heeger, David J.] NYU, Ctr Neural Sci, New York, NY 10003 USA","Li, HH (reprint author), NYU, Dept Psychol, 6 Washington Pl, New York, NY 10003 USA.",david.heeger@nyu.edu,,"Li, Hsin-Hung/0000-0003-3245-2071",National Institutes of Health - National Eye Institute [R01-EY019693],"This work was supported by National Institutes of Health - National Eye Institute (R01-EY019693; https://www.nei.nih.gov) to DJH and MC.

For this purpose we designed a probabilistic Wisconsin card sorting task (WCST) with belief solicitation, in which subjects were presented with stimuli composed of multiple visual features. At each moment in time a particular feature was relevant for obtaining reward, and participants had to infer which feature was relevant and report their beliefs accordingly. To test the hypothesis that attentional focus modulates the belief update process, we derived and fitted several probabilistic and non-probabilistic behavioral models, which either incorporate a dynamical model of attentional focus, in the form of a hierarchical winner-take-all neuronal network, or a diffusive model, without attention-like features. We used Bayesian model selection to identify the most likely generative model of subjects' behavior and found that attention-like features in the behavioral model are essential for explaining subjects' responses.

Its great importance for biological research is owed to its speed, simplicity, reliability and wide applicability, covering more than half of the residues in protein sequence space. Although multiple templates have been shown to generally increase model quality over single templates, the information from multiple templates has so far been combined using empirically motivated, heuristic approaches. We present here a rigorous statistical framework for multi-template homology modeling. First, we find that the query proteins' atomic distance restraints can be accurately described by two-component Gaussian mixtures. This insight allowed us to apply the standard laws of probability theory to combine restraints from multiple templates. Second, we derive theoretically optimal weights to correct for the redundancy among related templates. Third, a heuristic template selection strategy is proposed.

To this end transmembrane chemo- and photoreceptors organized in large arrays initiate signaling cascades and ultimately regulate the rotation of flagellar motors. To unravel the molecular mechanism of signaling in an archaeal phototaxis complex we performed coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations of a trimer of receptor/transducer dimers, namely NpSRII/NpHtrII from Natronomonas pharaonis. Signaling is regulated by a reversible methylation mechanism called adaptation, which also influences the level of basal receptor activation. Mimicking two extreme methylation states in our simulations we found conformational changes for the transmembrane region of NpSRII/NpHtrII which resemble experimentally observed light-induced changes. Further downstream in the cytoplasmic domain of the transducer the signal propagates via distinct changes in the dynamics of HAMP1, HAMP2, the adaptation domain and the binding region for the kinase CheA, where conformational rearrangements were found to be subtle. Overall these observations suggest a signaling mechanism based on dynamic allostery resembling models previously proposed for E. coli chemoreceptors, indicating similar properties of signal transduction for archaeal photoreceptors and bacterial chemoreceptors.","[Orekhov, Philipp S.; Klose, Daniel; Mulkidjanian, Armen Y.; Klare, Johann P.; Steinhoff, Heinz-Juergen] Univ Osnabruck, Dept Phys, Osnabruck, Germany; [Orekhov, Philipp S.; Shaitan, Konstantin V.] Moscow MV Lomonosov State Univ, Dept Biol, Moscow, Russia; [Mulkidjanian, Armen Y.] Moscow MV Lomonosov State Univ, Dept Bioengn & Bioinformat, Moscow, Russia; [Mulkidjanian, Armen Y.] Moscow MV Lomonosov State Univ, AN Belozersky Inst Physicochem Biol, Moscow, Russia; [Engelhard, Martin] Max Planck Inst Mol Physiol, D-44139 Dortmund, Germany","Orekhov, PS (reprint author), Univ Osnabruck, Dept Phys, Osnabruck, Germany.",hsteinho@uni-osnabrueck.de,"Klare, Johann P./C-1428-2009; Orekhov, Philipp/V-5214-2017; Steinhoff, Heinz-Juergen/H-3791-2014; Mulkidjanian, Armen/J-8086-2013","Klare, Johann P./0000-0002-5761-5968; Orekhov, Philipp/0000-0003-4078-4762; Steinhoff, Heinz-Juergen/0000-0002-5888-0157; Mulkidjanian, Armen/0000-0001-5844-3064; Klose, Daniel/0000-0002-3597-0889",Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft [SFB 944]; Deutscher Akademischer Austauschdienst,"This work was supported by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (SFB 944) (HJS) and by the Deutscher Akademischer Austauschdienst (HJS).

Identifying multifunctional genes at the genome-wide level and studying their properties can shed light upon the complexity of molecular events that underpin cellular functioning, thereby leading to a better understanding of the functional landscape of the cell. However, to date, genome-wide analysis of multifunctional genes (and the proteins they encode) has been limited. Here we introduce a computational approach that uses known functional annotations to extract genes playing a role in at least two distinct biological processes. We leverage functional genomics data sets for three organisms-H. sapiens, D. melanogaster, and S. cerevisiae-and show that, as compared to other annotated genes, genes involved in multiple biological processes possess distinct physicochemical properties, are more broadly expressed, tend to be more central in protein interaction networks, tend to be more evolutionarily conserved, and are more likely to be essential. We also find that multifunctional genes are significantly more likely to be involved in human disorders. These same features also hold when multifunctionality is defined with respect to molecular functions instead of biological processes. Our analysis uncovers key features about multifunctional genes, and is a step towards a better genome-wide understanding of gene multifunctionality.","[Pritykin, Yuri; Singh, Mona] Princeton Univ, Dept Comp Sci, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [Pritykin, Yuri; Ghersi, Dario; Singh, Mona] Princeton Univ, Lewis Sigler Inst Integrat Genom, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [Ghersi, Dario] Univ Nebraska, Sch Interdisciplinary Informat, Omaha, NE 68182 USA","Pritykin, Y (reprint author), Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, Computat Biol Program, 1275 York Ave, New York, NY 10021 USA.",dghersi@unomaha.edu; mona@cs.princeton.edu,"Ghersi, Dario/H-4468-2019","Pritykin, Yury/0000-0001-6589-981X","NSF [ABI-0850063, CCF-0963825]; NIH [GM076275]","This work has been supported in part by NSF ABI-0850063, NIH GM076275, and NSF grant CCF-0963825.

These dense and overlapping patterns are transformed into a sparse code in Kenyon cells in the mushroom body. Although it is clear that this sparse code is the basis for rapid categorization of odors, it is yet unclear how the sparse code in Kenyon cells is computed and what information it represents. Here we show that this computation can be modeled by sequential firing rate patterns using Lotka-Volterra equations and Bayesian online inference. This new model can be understood as an 'intelligent coincidence detector', which robustly and dynamically encodes the presence of specific odor features. We found that the model is able to qualitatively reproduce experimentally observed activity in both the projection neurons and the Kenyon cells. In particular, the model explains mechanistically how sparse activity in the Kenyon cells arises from the dense code in the projection neurons. The odor classification performance of the model proved to be robust against noise and time jitter in the observed input sequences. As in recent experimental results, we found that recognition of an odor happened very early during stimulus presentation in the model.

Details of this process are however unclear. While previous work has shown that recurrent granule cell inhibition could in principle generate a wide variety of random outputs suitable for coding signal onsets, the more general application for temporally varying signals has yet to be demonstrated. Here we show for the first time that using a mechanism very similar to reservoir computing enables random neuronal networks in the granule cell layer to provide the necessary signal separation and extension from which Purkinje cells could construct basis filters of various time-constants. The main requirement for this is that the network operates in a state of criticality close to the edge of random chaotic behavior. We further show that the lack of recurrent excitation in the granular layer as commonly required in traditional reservoir networks can be circumvented by considering other inherent granular layer features such as inverted input signals or mGluR2 inhibition of Golgi cells. Other properties that facilitate filter construction are direct mossy fiber excitation of Golgi cells, variability of synaptic weights or input signals and output-feedback via the nucleocortical pathway. Our findings are well supported by previous experimental and theoretical work and will help to bridge the gap between system-level models and detailed models of the granular layer network.","[Roessert, Christian; Dean, Paul; Porrill, John] Univ Sheffield, Dept Psychol, Sheffield S10 2TN, S Yorkshire, England","Rossert, C (reprint author), EPFL, Blue Brain Project, Geneva, Switzerland.",christian.a@roessert.de,,,European Union [270434]; EPSRC [EP/IO32533/1],"This work was supported by a grant from the European Union 2012 (REALNET, 270434 FP7) and partially supported by EPSRC grant no.

The ""common input"" problem presents a major roadblock: it is difficult to reliably distinguish causal connections between pairs of observed neurons versus correlations induced by common input from unobserved neurons. Available techniques allow us to simultaneously record, with sufficient temporal resolution, only a small fraction of the network. Consequently, naive connectivity estimators that neglect these common input effects are highly biased. This work proposes a ""shotgun"" experimental design, in which we observe multiple sub-networks briefly, in a serial manner. Thus, while the full network cannot be observed simultaneously at any given time, we may be able to observe much larger subsets of the network over the course of the entire experiment, thus ameliorating the common input problem. Using a generalized linear model for a spiking recurrent neural network, we develop a scalable approximate expected loglikelihood-based Bayesian method to perform network inference given this type of data, in which only a small fraction of the network is observed in each time bin. We demonstrate in simulation that the shotgun experimental design can eliminate the biases induced by common input effects. Networks with thousands of neurons, in which only a small fraction of the neurons is observed in each time bin, can be quickly and accurately estimated, achieving orders of magnitude speed up over previous approaches.","[Soudry, Daniel; Stinson, Patrick; Paninski, Liam] Columbia Univ, Kavli Inst Brain Sci, Grossman Ctr Stat Mind, Ctr Theoret Neurosci,Dept Neurosci,Dept Stat, New York, NY 10016 USA; [Soudry, Daniel; Stinson, Patrick; Paninski, Liam] Columbia Univ, NeuroTechnol Ctr, New York, NY USA; [Keshri, Suraj; Oh, Min-hwan; Iyengar, Garud] Columbia Univ, Dept Ind Engn & Operat Res, New York, NY 10027 USA","Soudry, D (reprint author), Columbia Univ, Kavli Inst Brain Sci, Grossman Ctr Stat Mind, Ctr Theoret Neurosci,Dept Neurosci,Dept Stat, New York, NY 10016 USA.",daniel.soudry@gmail.com,,,"Gruss Lipper Charitable Foundation; Army Research Office Multidisciplinary University Research Initiative [W911NF-12-1-0594]; Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency [W91NF-14-10269, N66001-15-C-4032]; National Science Foundation Faculty Early Career Development Program [IOS-0641912]; National Science Foundation [IIS-1430239]","The work of DS was supported by the Gruss Lipper Charitable Foundation (http://www.eglcf.org).

As a result, experimental and computational methods are being developed, often synergistically, to study the dynamical heterogeneity of a protein or other macromolecules in solution. Thus, methods such as molecular dynamics simulations or ensemble refinement approaches have provided conformational ensembles that can be used to understand protein function and biophysics. These developments have in turn created a need for algorithms and software that can be used to compare structural ensembles in the same way as the root-mean-square-deviation is often used to compare static structures. Although a few such approaches have been proposed, these can be difficult to implement efficiently, hindering a broader applications and further developments. Here, we present an easily accessible software toolkit, called ENCORE, which can be used to compare conformational ensembles generated either from simulations alone or synergistically with experiments. ENCORE implements three previously described methods for ensemble comparison, that each can be used to quantify the similarity between conformational ensembles by estimating the overlap between the probability distributions that underlie them. We demonstrate the kinds of insights that can be obtained by providing examples of three typical use-cases: comparing ensembles generated with different molecular force fields, assessing convergence in molecular simulations, and calculating differences and similarities in structural ensembles refined with various sources of experimental data. We also demonstrate efficient computational scaling for typical analyses, and robustness against both the size and sampling of the ensembles.

They belong to clan CD of cysteine peptidases and contain a well-conserved C-terminal catalytic protease domain similar to caspases and gingipains. However, unlike other well-characterized groups of clan CD peptidases, there are no high-resolution structures of separases and the details of their regulation and substrate recognition are poorly understood. Here we undertook an in-depth bioinformatical analysis of separases from different species with respect to their similarity in amino acid sequence and protein fold in comparison to caspases, MALT-1 proteins (mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma translocation protein 1) and gingipain-R. A comparative model of the single C-terminal caspase-like domain in separase from C. elegans suggests similar binding modes of substrate peptides between these protein subfamilies, and enables differences in substrate specificity of separase proteins to be rationalised. We also modelled a newly identified putative death domain, located N-terminal to the caspase-like domain. The surface features of this domain identify potential sites of protein-protein interactions. Notably, we identified a novel conserved region with the consensus sequence WWxxRxxLD predicted to be exposed on the surface of the death domain, which we termed the WR motif. We envisage that findings from our study will guide structural and functional studies of this important protein family.","[Winter, Anja; Schmid, Ralf; Bayliss, Richard] Univ Leicester, Dept Biochem, Leicester LE1 7RH, Leics, England","Winter, A (reprint author), Univ Leicester, Dept Biochem, Leicester LE1 7RH, Leics, England.",richard.bayliss@le.ac.uk,"Schmid, Ralf/E-6722-2011","Schmid, Ralf/0000-0002-0203-4023; Bayliss, Richard/0000-0003-0604-2773; Winter, Anja/0000-0002-8602-8009",Cancer Research UK [C24461/A12772]; Cancer Research UK [12772],"The work was funded by Cancer Research UK (www.canceresearchuk.org) grant number C24461/A12772 to RB.

This spike synchrony may occur by chance, based solely on the neurons' fluctuating firing patterns, or it may occur too frequently to be explicable by chance alone. When spike synchrony above chances levels is present, it may subserve computation for a specific cognitive process, or it could be an irrelevant byproduct of such computation. Either way, spike synchrony is a feature of neural data that should be explained. A point process regression framework has been developed previously for this purpose, using generalized linear models (GLMs). In this framework, the observed number of synchronous spikes is compared to the number predicted by chance under varying assumptions about the factors that affect each of the individual neuron's firing-rate functions. An important possible source of spike synchrony is network-wide oscillations, which may provide an essential mechanism of network information flow. To establish the statistical link between spike synchrony and network-wide oscillations, we have integrated oscillatory field potentials into our point process regression framework. We first extended a previously-published model of spike-field association and showed that we could recover phase relationships between oscillatory field potentials and firing rates. We then used this new framework to demonstrate the statistical relationship between oscillatory field potentials and spike synchrony in: 1) simulated neurons, 2) in vitro recordings of hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cells, and 3) in vivo recordings of neocortical V4 neurons. Our results provide a rigorous method for establishing a statistical link between network oscillations and neural synchrony.","[Zhou, Pengcheng] Carnegie Mellon Univ, Program Neural Computat, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA; [Zhou, Pengcheng; Burton, Shawn D.; Snyder, Adam C.; Smith, Matthew A.; Urban, Nathaniel N.; Kass, Robert E.] Ctr Neural Basis Cognit, Pittsburgh, PA USA; [Burton, Shawn D.; Urban, Nathaniel N.] Carnegie Mellon Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA; [Snyder, Adam C.; Smith, Matthew A.] Univ Pittsburgh, Dept Ophthalmol, Pittsburgh, PA 15260 USA; [Urban, Nathaniel N.] Univ Pittsburgh, Dept Neurobiol, Pittsburgh, PA USA; [Kass, Robert E.] Carnegie Mellon Univ, Dept Stat, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA; [Kass, Robert E.] Carnegie Mellon Univ, Dept Machine Learning, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA","Zhou, PC (reprint author), Carnegie Mellon Univ, Program Neural Computat, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA.",kass@stat.cmu.edu,"Zhou, Pengcheng/D-7613-2018; Snyder, Adam C./J-3576-2019; Urban, Nathaniel/A-4974-2008; Burton, Shawn/C-4373-2015","Zhou, Pengcheng/0000-0003-1237-3931; Snyder, Adam C./0000-0003-1794-035X; Urban, Nathaniel/0000-0002-0365-9068; Burton, Shawn/0000-0002-8907-6487; Smith, Matthew A/0000-0003-1192-9942","National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [R01MH064537]; Richard King Mellon Foundation Presidential Fellowship in Life Sciences; National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) [R90DA023426]; Pennsylvania Department of Health [SAP4100054842]; National Science Foundation (NSF) [1430208]; National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders (NIDCD) [F31DC013490]; NIDCD [R01DC005798, R01DC011184]; National Eye Institute (NEI) [F32EY023456]; NEI [R01EY022928, P30EY008098]; career development award from Research to Prevent Blindness","PZ and REK are supported by National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH, http://www.nimh.nih.gov/index.shtml, R01MH064537); PZ is also supported by Richard King Mellon Foundation (http://foundationcenter.org/grantmaker/rkmellon/) Presidential Fellowship in Life Sciences, National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA, http://www.drugabuse.gov, R90DA023426), Pennsylvania Department of Health (http://www.portal.state.pa.us/portal/server.pt/community/health_research_program_cure/14189, Formula SAP4100054842); NNU and REK are supported by National Science Foundation (NSF, http://www.nsf.gov/, 1430208).

However, understanding cytoarchitectural dynamics of this process has been limited by the difficulty to quantitatively image brain development in vivo. Here, we study NSC dynamics within Neural Rosettes-highly organized multicellular structures derived from human pluripotent stem cells. Neural rosettes contain NSCs with strong epithelial polarity and are expected to perform apical-basal interkinetic nuclear migration (INM)-a hallmark of cortical radial glial cell development. We developed a quantitative live imaging framework to characterize INM dynamics within rosettes. We first show that the tendency of cells to follow the INM orientation-a phenomenon we referred to as radial organization, is associated with rosette size, presumably via mechanical constraints of the confining structure. Second, early forming rosettes, which are abundant with founder NSCs and correspond to the early proliferative developing cortex, show fast motions and enhanced radial organization. In contrast, later derived rosettes, which are characterized by reduced NSC capacity and elevated numbers of differentiated neurons, and thus correspond to neurogenesis mode in the developing cortex, exhibit slower motions and decreased radial organization. Third, later derived rosettes are characterized by temporal instability in INM measures, in agreement with progressive loss in rosette integrity at later developmental stages. Finally, molecular perturbations of INM by inhibition of ACTIN or NON-MUSCLE MYOSIN-II (NMII) reduced INM measures. Our framework enables quantification of cytoarchitecture NSC dynamics and may have implications in functional molecular studies, drug screening, and iPS cell-based platforms for disease modeling.","[Ziv, Omer; Yaffe, Yakey; Mutukula, Naresh; Edri, Reuven; Elkabetz, Yechiel] Tel Aviv Univ, Sackler Sch Med, Dept Cell & Dev Biol, IL-69978 Tel Aviv, Israel; [Zaritsky, Assaf] Univ Texas SW Med Ctr Dallas, Dept Cell Biol, Dallas, TX 75390 USA; [Zaritsky, Assaf] Tel Aviv Univ, Blavatnik Sch Comp Sci, IL-69978 Tel Aviv, Israel","Ziv, O (reprint author), Tel Aviv Univ, Sackler Sch Med, Dept Cell & Dev Biol, IL-69978 Tel Aviv, Israel.",elkabetz@tauex.tau.ac.il,,"Zaritsky, Assaf/0000-0002-1477-5478","Israeli Science Foundation [ISF 1126/10, ISF 1710/10, 1592/13]; Marie Currie Reintegration Grant [IRG 277151]; MaCancer Prevention and Research Institute of Texas at UT Southwestern Medical Center at Dallas [CPRIT R1255]","This work was supported in part by research grants from the Israeli Science Foundation (ISF 1126/10, ISF 1710/10, 1592/13) and Marie Currie Reintegration Grant (IRG 277151) to YE supporting OZ, YY, NM and RE; MaCancer Prevention and Research Institute of Texas (CPRIT R1255) at UT Southwestern Medical Center at Dallas (to Gaudenz Danuser supporting AZ).

Growth is gradually recovered as the organism adapts to the new condition. This adaptation can be modeled as a process of repeated metabolic adjustments obtained through the resilencings of the non-essential metabolic reactions, using growth rate as selection probability for the phenotypes obtained. The resulting metabolic adaptation process tends naturally to steer the metabolic fluxes towards high growth phenotypes. Quite remarkably, when applied to the central carbon metabolism of E. coli, it follows that nearly all flux distributions converge to the flux vector representing optimal growth, i.e., the solution of the biomass optimization problem turns out to be the dominant attractor of the metabolic adaptation process.","[Altafini, Claudio] Linkoping Univ, Dept Elect Engn, Div Automat Control, S-58183 Linkoping, Sweden; [Facchetti, Giuseppe] John Innes Ctr, Norwich, Norfolk, England","Altafini, C (reprint author), Linkoping Univ, Dept Elect Engn, Div Automat Control, S-58183 Linkoping, Sweden.",claudio.altafini@liu.se,,"Altafini, Claudio/0000-0003-4142-6502",,,,32,1,1,0,0,PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE,SAN FRANCISCO,"1160 BATTERY STREET, STE 100, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94111 USA",,1553-7358,,PLOS COMPUT BIOL,PLoS Comput.

Among them, the alpha rhythm in human EEG is one of the most prominent examples. However, its precise mechanisms of generation are still poorly understood. It was mainly this lack of knowledge that motivated a number of simultaneous electroencephalography (EEG) - functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies. This approach revealed how oscillatory neuronal signatures such as the alpha rhythm are paralleled by changes of the blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) signal. Several such studies revealed a negative correlation between the alpha rhythm and the hemodynamic BOLD signal in visual cortex and a positive correlation in the thalamus. In this study we explore the potential generative mechanisms that lead to those observations. We use a bursting capable Stefanescu-Jirsa 3D (SJ3D) neural-mass model that reproduces a wide repertoire of prominent features of local neuronal-population dynamics. We construct a thalamo-cortical network of coupled SJ3D nodes considering excitatory and inhibitory directed connections. The model suggests that an inverse correlation between cortical multi-unit activity, i.e. the firing of neuronal populations, and narrow band local field potential oscillations in the alpha band underlies the empirically observed negative correlation between alpha-rhythm power and fMRI signal in visual cortex. Furthermore the model suggests that the interplay between tonic and bursting mode in thalamus and cortex is critical for this relation. This demonstrates how biophysically meaningful modelling can generate precise and testable hypotheses about the underpinnings of large-scale neuroimaging signals.","[Becker, Robert] Univ Geneva, Funct Brain Mapping Lab, Geneva, Switzerland; [Knock, Stuart; Jirsa, Viktor] Aix Marseille Univ, Inst Neurosci Syst, Marseille, France; [Ritter, Petra] Max Planck Inst Human Cognit & Brain Sci, Minerva Res Grp BrainModes, Leipzig, Germany; [Ritter, Petra] Charite, Dept Neurol, D-13353 Berlin, Germany; [Ritter, Petra] Univ Med, Bernstein Ctr Computat Neurosci, Berlin, Germany; [Ritter, Petra] Humboldt Univ, Berlin Sch Mind & Brain, D-10099 Berlin, Germany; [Ritter, Petra] Humboldt Univ, Mind & Brain Inst, D-10099 Berlin, Germany; [Jirsa, Viktor] Aix Marseille Univ, INSERM, UMR 1106, Marseille, France","Becker, R (reprint author), Univ Geneva, Funct Brain Mapping Lab, Geneva, Switzerland.",email@robertbecker.info; petra.ritter@charite.de,"Jirsa, Viktor/M-4630-2016","Jirsa, Viktor/0000-0002-8251-8860",James S.

A prominent example is the adaptive phenotypic switching between cell migration and proliferation. While it has been shown that the migration-proliferation plasticity influences tumor spread, it remains unclear how this particular phenotypic plasticity affects overall tumor growth, in particular initiation and persistence. To address this problem, we formulate and study a mathematical model of spatio-temporal tumor dynamics which incorporates the microenvironmental influence through a local cell density dependence. Our analysis reveals that two dynamic regimes can be distinguished. If cell motility is allowed to increase with local cell density, any tumor cell population will persist in time, irrespective of its initial size. On the contrary, if cell motility is assumed to decrease with respect to local cell density, any tumor population below a certain size threshold will eventually extinguish, a fact usually termed as Allee effect in ecology. These results suggest that strategies aimed at modulating migration are worth to be explored as alternatives to those mainly focused at keeping tumor proliferation under control.","[Boettger, Katrin; Voss-Boehme, Anja; Deutsch, Andreas] Tech Univ Dresden, Ctr Informat Serv & High Performance Comp, D-01062 Dresden, Germany; [Hatzikirou, Haralambos] Tech Univ Dresden, Ctr Adv Elect, D-01062 Dresden, Germany; [Voss-Boehme, Anja] Hsch Tech & Wirtschaft Dresden, Dresden, Germany; [Cavalcanti-Adam, Elisabetta Ada] Heidelberg Univ, Inst Phys Chem, Dept Biophys Chem, Heidelberg, Germany; [Cavalcanti-Adam, Elisabetta Ada] Max Planck Inst Intelligent Syst, Stuttgart, Germany; [Herrero, Miguel A.] Univ Complutense, Dept Matemat Aplicada, Fac Matemat, E-28040 Madrid, Spain","Bottger, K (reprint author), Tech Univ Dresden, Ctr Informat Serv & High Performance Comp, D-01062 Dresden, Germany.",andreas.deutsch@tu-dresden.de,"Voss-Bohme, Anja/O-6869-2017","Voss-Bohme, Anja/0000-0001-6510-8694; Cavalcanti-Adam, Elisabetta/0000-0003-0243-1552; Hatzikirou, Haralampos/0000-0002-1270-7885","Free State of Saxony; European Social Fund of European Union (ESF grant GlioMath-Dresden); German Research Foundation (DFG) within Cluster of Excellence 'Center for Advancing Electronics Dresden'; German Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) [SYSIMIT-01ZX1308D, 0315734]; Max Planck Society; MINECO [MTM2014-53156]","This work was supported by the Free State of Saxony and European Social Fund of the European Union (ESF, grant GlioMath-Dresden).

IIT postulates that consciousness is equal to integrated information (Phi). The goal of this paper is to show that IIT fails in its stated goal of quantifying consciousness. The paper will challenge the theoretical and empirical arguments in support of IIT. The main theoretical argument for the relevance of integrated information to consciousness is the principle of information exclusion. Yet, no justification is given to support this principle. Tononi claims there is significant empirical support for IIT, but this is called into question by the creation of a trivial theory of consciousness with equal explanatory power. After examining the theoretical and empirical evidence for IIT, arguments from philosophy of mind and epistemology will be examined. Since IIT is not a form of computational functionalism, it is vulnerable to fading/dancing qualia arguments. Finally, the limitations of the phenomenological approach to studying consciousness are examined, and it will be shown that IIT is a theory of protoconsciousness rather than a theory of consciousness.","Cincinnati Inst Cognit Sci, Cincinnati, OH 45220 USA","Cerullo, MA (reprint author), Cincinnati Inst Cognit Sci, Cincinnati, OH 45220 USA.",Cincinnati.psychiatry@gmail.com,,,,,,53,22,24,0,21,PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE,SAN FRANCISCO,"1160 BATTERY STREET, STE 100, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94111 USA",1553-734X,1553-7358,,PLOS COMPUT BIOL,PLoS Comput.

The effects of those alterations on the fitness of somatic cells lead to evolutionary adaptations such as increased cell proliferation, angiogenesis, and altered anticancer drug responses. However, there are few general mathematical models to quantitatively examine how perturbations of a single gene shape subsequent evolution of the cancer genome. In this study, we proposed the gene gravity model to study the evolution of cancer genomes by incorporating the genome-wide transcription and somatic mutation profiles of similar to 3,000 tumors across 9 cancer types from The Cancer Genome Atlas into a broad gene network. We found that somatic mutations of a cancer driver gene may drive cancer genome evolution by inducing mutations in other genes. This functional consequence is often generated by the combined effect of genetic and epigenetic (e.g., chromatin regulation) alterations. By quantifying cancer genome evolution using the gene gravity model, we identified six putative cancer genes (AHNAK, COL11A1, DDX3X, FAT4, STAG2, and SYNE1). The tumor genomes harboring the nonsynonymous somatic mutations in these genes had a higher mutation density at the genome level compared to the wild-type groups. Furthermore, we provided statistical evidence that hypermutation of cancer driver genes on inactive X chromosomes is a general feature in female cancer genomes. In summary, this study sheds light on the functional consequences and evolutionary characteristics of somatic mutations during tumorigenesis by propelling adaptive cancer genome evolution, which would provide new perspectives for cancer research and therapeutics.","[Cheng, Feixiong; Lin, Chen-Ching; Zhao, Junfei; Jia, Peilin; Zhao, Zhongming] Vanderbilt Univ, Sch Med, Dept Biomed Informat, Nashville, TN 37212 USA; [Liu, Chuang] Hangzhou Normal Univ, Alibaba Res Ctr Complex Sci, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Jia, Peilin; Zhao, Zhongming] Vanderbilt Univ, Med Ctr, Ctr Quantitat Sci, Nashville, TN USA; [Li, Wen-Hsiung] Univ Chicago, Dept Ecol & Evolut, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Li, Wen-Hsiung] Acad Sinica, Biodivers Res Ctr, Taipei 115, Taiwan; [Li, Wen-Hsiung] Acad Sinica, Genom Res Ctr, Taipei 115, Taiwan; [Zhao, Zhongming] Vanderbilt Univ, Sch Med, Dept Canc Biol, Nashville, TN 37212 USA","Cheng, FX (reprint author), Vanderbilt Univ, Sch Med, Dept Biomed Informat, Nashville, TN 37212 USA.",zhongming.zhao@vanderbilt.edu,,"Li, Wen-Hsiung/0000-0003-1086-1456; Cheng, Feixiong/0000-0002-1736-2847","National Institutes of Health [R01LM011177, P50CA095103, P50CA098131, P30CA068485]; Robert J.

While simple decisions involve choosing a goal and pursuing it, humans evolved to survive in hostile dynamic environments where goal availability and value can change with time and previous actions, entangling goal decisions with action selection. Recent studies suggest the brain generates concurrent action-plans for competing goals, using online information to bias the competition until a single goal is pursued. This creates a challenging problem of integrating information across diverse types, including both the dynamic value of the goal and the costs of action. We model the computations underlying dynamic decision-making with disparate value types, using the probability of getting the highest pay-off with the least effort as a common currency that supports goal competition. This framework predicts many aspects of decision behavior that have eluded a common explanation.","[Christopoulos, Vassilios] CALTECH, Div Biol & Biol Engn, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA; [Schrater, Paul R.] Univ Minnesota, Dept Psychol, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA; [Schrater, Paul R.] Univ Minnesota, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Minneapolis, MN USA","Christopoulos, V (reprint author), CALTECH, Div Biol & Biol Engn, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA.",vchristo@caltech.edu,,,ONR [N000140710937],"This work was funded by ONR: N000140710937.

Doing so through a detailed characterization of structure spaces and underlying energy landscapes is desirable but continues to challenge methods based on Molecular Dynamics. In this paper we propose a novel algorithm, SIfTER, which is based instead on stochastic optimization to circumvent the computational challenge of exploring the breadth of a protein's structure space. SIfTER is a data-driven evolutionary algorithm, leveraging experimentally-available structures of wildtype and variant sequences of a protein to define a reduced search space from where to efficiently draw samples corresponding to novel structures not directly observed in the wet laboratory. The main advantage of SIfTER is its ability to rapidly generate conformational ensembles, thus allowing mapping and juxtaposing landscapes of variant sequences and relating observed differences to functional changes. We apply SIfTER to variant sequences of the H-Ras catalytic domain, due to the prominent role of the Ras protein in signaling pathways that control cell proliferation, its well-studied conformational switching, and abundance of documented mutations in several human tumors. Many Ras mutations are oncogenic, but detailed energy landscapes have not been reported until now. Analysis of SIfTER-computed energy landscapes for the wildtype and two oncogenic variants, G12V and Q61L, suggests that these mutations cause constitutive activation through two different mechanisms. G12V directly affects binding specificity while leaving the energy landscape largely unchanged, whereas Q61L has pronounced, starker effects on the landscape. An implementation of SIfTER is made available at http://www.cs.gmu.edu/similar to ashehu/?q=OurTools. We believe SIfTER is useful to the community to answer the question of how sequence mutations affect the function of a protein, when there is an abundance of experimental structures that can be exploited to reconstruct an energy landscape that would be computationally impractical to do via Molecular Dynamics.","[Clausen, Rudy; Shehu, Amarda] George Mason Univ, Dept Comp Sci, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA; [Ma, Buyong; Nussinov, Ruth] NCI, Basic Sci Program, Leidos Biomed Res Inc, Canc & Inflammat Program, Frederick, MD 21701 USA; [Nussinov, Ruth] Tel Aviv Univ, Sackler Sch Med, Sackler Inst Mol Med, Dept Human Genet & Mol Med, IL-69978 Tel Aviv, Israel; [Shehu, Amarda] George Mason Univ, Dept Bioengn, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA; [Shehu, Amarda] George Mason Univ, Sch Syst Biol, Manassas, VA USA","Clausen, R (reprint author), George Mason Univ, Dept Comp Sci, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA.",nussinor@helix.nih.gov; amarda@gmu.edu,"Ma, Buyong/F-9491-2011","Ma, Buyong/0000-0002-7383-719X","National Science Foundation [1421001, 1144106]; Thomas F. and Kate Miller Jeffress Memorial Trust Award; NCI; NIH [HHSN261200800001E]; Intramural Research Program of NIH; NCI, Center for Cancer Research","Funding for this work is provided in part by the National Science Foundation (Grant No. 1421001 and CAREER Award No. 1144106 to AS) and the Thomas F. and Kate Miller Jeffress Memorial Trust Award to AS.

Model-based RL is more flexible than model-free but requires sophisticated calculations using a learnt model of the world. This has led model-based RL to be identified with slow, deliberative processing, and model-free RL with fast, automatic processing. In support of this distinction, it has recently been shown that model-based reasoning is impaired by placing subjects under cognitive load-a hallmark of non-automaticity. Here, using the same task, we show that cognitive load does not impair model-based reasoning if subjects receive prior training on the task. This finding is replicated across two studies and a variety of analysis methods. Thus, task familiarity permits use of model-based reasoning in parallel with other cognitive demands. The ability to deploy model-based reasoning in an automatic, parallelizable fashion has widespread theoretical implications, particularly for the learning and execution of complex behaviors. It also suggests a range of important failure modes in psychiatric disorders.","[Economides, Marcos; Kurth-Nelson, Zeb; Luebbert, Annika; Guitart-Masip, Marc; Dolan, Raymond J.] UCL, Inst Neurol, Wellcome Trust Ctr Neuroimaging, London, England; [Kurth-Nelson, Zeb; Dolan, Raymond J.] UCL, Max Planck Ctr Computat Psychiat & Ageing, London, England; [Guitart-Masip, Marc] Karolinska Inst, Ageing Res Ctr, Stockholm, Sweden","Economides, M (reprint author), UCL, Inst Neurol, Wellcome Trust Ctr Neuroimaging, London, England.",m.economides@ucl.ac.uk,,"Guitart Masip, Marc/0000-0002-2294-6492",Wellcome Trust [Ray Dolan Senior Investigator Award] [098362/Z/12/Z]; Medical Research Council [G1000411]; Wellcome Trust [091593/Z/10/Z]; Max Planck Society,"This work was supported by the Wellcome Trust [Ray Dolan Senior Investigator Award 098362/Z/12/Z].

Here we present an adaptive model of a balanced neuronal network that combines two different types of plasticity, STDP and synaptic scaling. The plasticity rules yield both long-tailed distributions of synaptic weights and firing rates. Simultaneously, a highly connected subnetwork of driver neurons with strong synapses emerges. Coincident spiking activity of several driver cells can evoke population bursts and driver cells have similar dynamical properties as leader neurons found experimentally. Our model allows us to observe the delicate interplay between structural and dynamical properties of the emergent inhomogeneities.

Recent studies have pointed out the importance of regulatory network plasticity in bacterial adaptation and evolution. The evolution of such networks within and outside the species boundary is however still obscure. Sinorhizobium meliloti is an ideal species for such study, having three large replicons, many genomes available and a significant knowledge of its transcription factors (TF). Each replicon has a specific functional and evolutionary mark; which might also emerge from the analysis of their regulatory signatures. Here we have studied the plasticity of the regulatory network within and outside the S. meliloti species, looking for the presence of 41 TFs binding motifs in 51 strains and 5 related rhizobial species. We have detected a preference of several TFs for one of the three replicons, and the function of regulated genes was found to be in accordance with the overall replicon functional signature: house- keeping functions for the chromosome, metabolism for the chromid, symbiosis for the megaplasmid. This therefore suggests a replicon-specific wiring of the regulatory network in the S. meliloti species. At the same time a significant part of the predicted regulatory network is shared between the chromosome and the chromid, thus adding an additional layer by which the chromid integrates itself in the core genome. Furthermore, the regulatory network distance was found to be correlated with both promoter regions and accessory genome evolution inside the species, indicating that both pangenome compartments are involved in the regulatory network evolution. We also observed that genes which are not included in the species regulatory network are more likely to belong to the accessory genome, indicating that regulatory interactions should also be considered to predict gene conservation in bacterial pangenomes.","[Galardini, Marco; Rossi, Matteo; Roncaglia, Bianca; Bani, Alessia; Chiancianesi, Manuela; Bacci, Giovanni; Bazzicalupo, Marco; Mengoni, Alessio] Univ Florence, Dept Biol, Florence, Italy; [Brilli, Matteo] Fdn Edmund Mach, Dept Genom & Biol Fruit Crops, San Michele All Adige, Italy; [Spini, Giulia] Univ Florence, Sez Microbiol, Dipartimento Biotecnol Agr, Florence, Italy; [Moretto, Marco; Engelen, Kristof] Fdn Edmund Mach, Res & Innovat Ctr, Dept Computat Biol, San Michele All Adige, Italy; [Bacci, Giovanni] Ctr Ric Studio Relaz Tra Pianta & Suolo CRA RPS, Consiglio Ric & Sperimentaz Agr, Rome, Italy; [Pini, Francesco; Biondi, Emanuele G.] Univ Lille Nord France, CNRS, USR3078, Interdisciplinary Res Inst, Villeneuve Dascq, France","Galardini, M (reprint author), EMBL EBI, Wellcome Trust Genome Campus, Cambridge, England.",alessio.mengoni@unifi.it,"Galardini, Marco/H-6413-2019; Mengoni, Alessio/G-5336-2013; Pini, Francesco/E-9630-2015; Brilli, Matteo/F-4674-2011","Galardini, Marco/0000-0003-2018-8242; Mengoni, Alessio/0000-0002-1265-8251; Bacci, Giovanni/0000-0003-4406-7816; Pini, Francesco/0000-0001-5323-8395; Moretto, Marco/0000-0003-4555-7243; Engelen, Kristof/0000-0001-6215-1689; Brilli, Matteo/0000-0001-9891-4617",,,,76,18,18,0,9,PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE,SAN FRANCISCO,"1160 BATTERY STREET, STE 100, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94111 USA",1553-734X,1553-7358,,PLOS COMPUT BIOL,PLoS Comput.

The huddle is considered to be an example of a self-organising system, because complex properties of the collective group behaviour are thought to emerge spontaneously through simple interactions between individuals. Groups of rodent pups display two such emergent properties. First, huddling undergoes a 'phase transition', such that pups start to aggregate rapidly as the temperature of the environment falls below a critical temperature. Second, the huddle maintains a constant 'pup flow', where cooler pups at the periphery continually displace warmer pups at the centre. We set out to test whether these complex group behaviours can emerge spontaneously from local interactions between individuals. We designed a model using a minimal set of assumptions about how individual pups interact, by simply turning towards heat sources, and show in computer simulations that the model reproduces the first emergent property-the phase transition. However, this minimal model tends to produce an unnatural behaviour where several smaller aggregates emerge rather than one large huddle. We found that an extension of the minimal model to include heat exchange between pups allows the group to maintain one large huddle but eradicates the phase transition, whereas inclusion of an additional homeostatic term recovers the phase transition for large huddles. As an unanticipated consequence, the extended model also naturally gave rise to the second observed emergent property-a continuous pup flow. The model therefore serves as a minimal description of huddling as a self-organising system, and as an existence proof that group-level huddling dynamics emerge spontaneously through simple interactions between individuals. We derive a specific testable prediction: Increasing the capacity of the individual to generate or conserve heat will increase the range of ambient temperatures over which adaptive thermoregulatory huddling will emerge.","[Glancy, Jonathan; Gross, Roderich; Stone, James V.; Wilson, Stuart P.] Univ Sheffield, Sheffield Robot, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, England; [Glancy, Jonathan; Stone, James V.; Wilson, Stuart P.] Univ Sheffield, Dept Psychol, Sheffield S10 2TN, S Yorkshire, England; [Gross, Roderich] Univ Sheffield, Dept Automat Control & Syst Engn, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, England","Glancy, J (reprint author), Univ Sheffield, Sheffield Robot, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, England.",J.Glancy@Sheffield.ac.uk; S.P.Wilson@Sheffield.ac.uk,"GROSS, Roderich/A-6657-2008","GROSS, Roderich/0000-0003-1826-1375; Wilson, Stuart/0000-0001-8125-5133; Stone, James V/0000-0003-3428-5588",Doctoral Training Grant from the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council [EP/K503149/1],"This work was supported by a Doctoral Training Grant from the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EP/K503149/1).

The predicted scaffold proteins showed several interesting characteristics, as we expected from the functionality of scaffold proteins. We found that the scaffold proteins are likely to interact with each other, which is consistent with previous finding that scaffold proteins tend to form homodimers and heterodimers.

Despite these robust behavioral effects, reinforcement learning models reliant on reward prediction error or associative strength routinely fail to perform these inferences. We propose an algorithm called betasort, inspired by cognitive processes, which performs transitive inference at low computational cost. This is accomplished by (1) representing stimulus positions along a unit span using beta distributions, (2) treating positive and negative feedback asymmetrically, and (3) updating the position of every stimulus during every trial, whether that stimulus was visible or not. Performance was compared for rhesus macaques, humans, and the betasort algorithm, as well as Q-learning, an established reward-prediction error (RPE) model. Of these, only Q-learning failed to respond above chance during critical test trials. Betasort's success (when compared to RPE models) and its computational efficiency (when compared to full Markov decision process implementations) suggests that the study of reinforcement learning in organisms will be best served by a feature-driven approach to comparing formal models.","[Jensen, Greg; Munoz, Fabian; Alkan, Yelda; Ferrera, Vincent P.] Columbia Univ, Dept Neurosci, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Jensen, Greg; Terrace, Herbert S.] Columbia Univ, Dept Psychol, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Ferrera, Vincent P.] Columbia Univ, Dept Psychiat, New York, NY USA","Jensen, G (reprint author), Columbia Univ, Dept Neurosci, New York, NY 10027 USA.",greg.guichard.jensen@gmail.com,"Jensen, Greg/H-5106-2019","Jensen, Greg/0000-0001-5050-4360; Ferrera, Vincent/0000-0002-6599-7740",US National Institute of Mental Health [5R01MH081153],"This work was supported by US National Institute of Mental Health < http://www.nimh.nih.gov/>, grant number 5R01MH081153 awarded to VPF and HST.

Fibrinolysis controls blood clot dissolution through the action of the enzyme plasmin, which cleaves fibrin at specific locations. Although the main biochemical factors involved in fibrin formation and lysis have been identified, a clear mechanistic picture of how these processes take place is not available yet. This picture would be instrumental, for example, for the design of improved thrombolytic or anti-haemorrhagic strategies, as well as, materials with improved biocompatibility. Here, we present extensive molecular dynamics simulations of fibrinogen which reveal large bending motions centered at a hinge point in the coiled-coil regions of the molecule. This feature, likely conserved across vertebrates according to our analysis, suggests an explanation for the mechanism of exposure to lysis of the plasmin cleavage sites on fibrinogen coiled-coil region. It also explains the conformational variability of fibrinogen observed during its adsorption on inorganic surfaces and it is supposed to play a major role in the determination of the hydrodynamic properties of fibrinogen. In addition the simulations suggest how the dynamics of the D region of fibrinogen may contribute to the allosteric regulation of the blood coagulation cascade through a dynamic coupling between the a-and b-holes, important for fibrin polymerization, and the integrin binding site P1.","[Koehler, Stephan; Schmid, Friederike; Settanni, Giovanni] Johannes Gutenberg Univ Mainz, Inst Phys, Mainz, Germany; [Koehler, Stephan] Grad Sch Mat Sci Mainz, Mainz, Germany; [Settanni, Giovanni] Johannes Gutenberg Univ Mainz, Max Planck Grad Ctr, D-55122 Mainz, Germany","Kohler, S (reprint author), Johannes Gutenberg Univ Mainz, Inst Phys, Mainz, Germany.",settanni@uni-mainz.de,,,"German Science Foundation [SFB 1066, SFB TRR 146]; Graduate School of Excellence Materials Science in Mainz; Max-Planck Graduate Center; University of Mainz;  [HMZ29]","We gratefully acknowledge financial support from the German Science Foundation (http://www.dfg.de) within SFB 1066 (http://www.sfb1066.uni-mainz.de) and SFB TRR 146 (http://trr146.de).

Although synaptic release processes are well known for their ability to shape the interaction between neurons in microcircuits, most computational models do not simulate the synaptic transmission process directly and hence cannot explain how changes in synaptic parameters alter neuronal network activity. In this paper, we present a novel neuronal network model that incorporates presynaptic release mechanisms, such as vesicle pool dynamics and calcium-dependent release probability, to model the spontaneous activity of neuronal networks. The model, which is based on modified leaky integrate-and-fire neurons, generates spontaneous network activity patterns, which are similar to experimental data and robust under changes in the model's primary gain parameters such as excitatory postsynaptic potential and connectivity ratio. Furthermore, it reliably recreates experimental findings and provides mechanistic explanations for data obtained from microelectrode array recordings, such as network burst termination and the effects of pharmacological and genetic manipulations. The model demonstrates how elevated asynchronous release, but not spontaneous release, synchronizes neuronal network activity and reveals that asynchronous release enhances utilization of the recycling vesicle pool to induce the network effect. The model further predicts a positive correlation between vesicle priming at the single-neuron level and burst frequency at the network level; this prediction is supported by experimental findings. Thus, the model is utilized to reveal how synaptic release processes at the neuronal level govern activity patterns and synchronization at the network level.","[Lavi, Ayal; Ashery, Uri] Tel Aviv Univ, Inst Life Sci, Dept Neurobiol, IL-69978 Tel Aviv, Israel; [Lavi, Ayal; Perez, Omri; Ashery, Uri] Tel Aviv Univ, Sagol Sch Neurosci, IL-69978 Tel Aviv, Israel; [Perez, Omri] Tel Aviv Univ, Sackler Sch Med, IL-69978 Tel Aviv, Israel","Lavi, A (reprint author), Tel Aviv Univ, Inst Life Sci, Dept Neurobiol, IL-69978 Tel Aviv, Israel.",uriashery@gmail.com,"Lavi, Ayal/Q-6395-2018","Ashery, Uri/0000-0001-6338-7888","Israel Science Foundation [1211/07, 730/11]; German-Israeli Foundation [1125- 145.1/2010]; Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. fellowship under Israeli National Network of Excellence in Neuroscience (NNE)","This work was supported, in part, by Israel Science Foundation Grants 1211/07 and 730/11 (http://www.isf.org.il/english/) and the German-Israeli Foundation Grant 1125- 145.1/2010 (http://www.gif.org.il/Pages/default.aspx) to UA.

Recently, lipidomes of biological model organisms and cell lines were published and the number of functional studies of lipids is increasing. In this study we propose a homology metric that can quantify systematic differences in the composition of a lipidome. Algorithms were developed to 1. consistently convert lipids structure into SMILES, 2. determine structural similarity between molecular species and 3. describe a lipidome in a chemical space model. We tested lipid structure conversion and structure similarity metrics, in detail, using sets of isomeric ceramide molecules and chemically related phosphatidylinositols. Template-based SMILES showed the best properties for representing lipid-specific structural diversity. We also show that sequence analysis algorithms are best suited to calculate distances between such template-based SMILES and we adjudged the Levenshtein distance as best choice for quantifying structural changes. When all lipid molecules of the LIPIDMAPS structure database were mapped in chemical space, they automatically formed clusters corresponding to conventional chemical families. Accordingly, we mapped a pair of lipidomes into the same chemical space and determined the degree of overlap by calculating the Hausdorff distance. We named this metric the 'Lipidome jUXtaposition (LUX) score'. First, we tested this approach for estimating the lipidome similarity on four yeast strains with known genetic alteration in fatty acid synthesis. We show that the LUX score reflects the genetic relationship and growth temperature better than conventional methods although the score is based solely on lipid structures. Next, we applied this metric to high-throughput data of larval tissue lipidomes of Drosophila. This showed that the LUX score is sufficient to cluster tissues and determine the impact of nutritional changes in an unbiased manner, despite the limited information on the underlying structural diversity of each lipidome. This study is the first effort to define a lipidome homology metric based on structures that will enrich functional association of lipids in a similar manner to measures used in genetics. Finally, we discuss the significance of the LUX score to perform comparative lipidome studies across species borders.","[Marella, Chakravarthy; Schwudke, Dominik] Leibniz Ctr Med & Biosci, Res Ctr Borstel, Div Bioanalyt Chem, Borstel, SH, Germany; [Marella, Chakravarthy; Schwudke, Dominik] Tata Inst Fundamental Res, Natl Ctr Biol Sci, Bangalore, Karnataka, India; [Torda, Andrew E.] Univ Hamburg, Ctr Bioinformat, Hamburg, Germany; [Schwudke, Dominik] German Ctr Lung Res, Airway Res Ctr North, Grosshansdorf, SH, Germany; [Schwudke, Dominik] TTU Tb, German Ctr Infect Res, Borstel, SH, Germany","Marella, C (reprint author), Leibniz Ctr Med & Biosci, Res Ctr Borstel, Div Bioanalyt Chem, Borstel, SH, Germany.",dschwudke@fz-borstel.de,"Schwudke, Dominik/B-3478-2013","Schwudke, Dominik/0000-0002-1379-9451",German Research Foundation (DFG); Wellcome Trust/DBT India Alliance; University Grants Commission of India,"This work was funded by the German Research Foundation (DFG), Wellcome Trust/DBT India Alliance and the University Grants Commission of India (http://www.ugc.ac.in/).

Here, we present a new method for calculating metabolic fluxes, key targets in metabolic engineering, that incorporates data from C-13 labeling experiments and genome-scale models. The data from C-13 labeling experiments provide strong flux constraints that eliminate the need to assume an evolutionary optimization principle such as the growth rate optimization assumption used in Flux Balance Analysis (FBA). This effective constraining is achieved by making the simple but biologically relevant assumption that flux flows from core to peripheral metabolism and does not flow back. The new method is significantly more robust than FBA with respect to errors in genome-scale model reconstruction. Furthermore, it can provide a comprehensive picture of metabolite balancing and predictions for unmeasured extracellular fluxes as constrained by C-13 labeling data. A comparison shows that the results of this new method are similar to those found through C-13 Metabolic Flux Analysis (C-13 MFA) for central carbon metabolism but, additionally, it provides flux estimates for peripheral metabolism. The extra validation gained by matching 48 relative labeling measurements is used to identify where and why several existing COnstraint Based Reconstruction and Analysis (COBRA) flux prediction algorithms fail. We demonstrate how to use this knowledge to refine these methods and improve their predictive capabilities.

To exemplify our approach, we present a detailed quantitative case study for policy models defined in terms of conditional restricted Boltzmann machines. In contrast to non-embodied universal approximation, which requires an exponential number of parameters, in the embodied setting we are able to generate all possible behaviors with a drastically smaller model, thus obtaining cheap universal approximation.

The E.coli chaperone, GroEL binds with a large number of unfolded and partially folded proteins, to facilitate proper folding and prevent misfolding and aggregation. Although the major structural components of GroEL are well defined, scaffolds of the non-native substrates that determine chaperone-mediated folding have been difficult to recognize. Here we performed all-atomistic and replica-exchange molecular dynamics simulations to dissect non-native ensemble of an obligate GroEL folder, DapA. Thermodynamics analyses of unfolding simulations revealed populated intermediates with distinct structural characteristics. We found that surface exposed hydrophobic patches are significantly increased, primarily contributed from native and non-native beta-sheet elements. We validate the structural properties of these conformers using experimental data, including circular dichroism (CD), 1-anilinonaphthalene-8-sulfonic acid (ANS) binding measurements and previously reported hydrogen-deutrium exchange coupled to mass spectrometry (HDX-MS). Further, we constructed network graphs to elucidate long-range intra-protein connectivity of native and intermediate topologies, demonstrating regions that serve as central ""hubs"". Overall, our results implicate that genomic variations (or mutations) in the distinct regions of protein structures might disrupt these topological signatures disabling chaperone-mediated folding, leading to formation of aggregates.","[Nagpal, Suhani; Tiwari, Satyam; Mapa, Koyeli; Thukral, Lipi] CSIR, Inst Genom & Integrat Biol, New Delhi 110001, India; [Tiwari, Satyam] Acad Sci & Innovat Res AcSIR, New Delhi, India; [Mapa, Koyeli] Shiv Nadar Univ, Sch Nat Sci, Dept Life Sci, Dadri, Uttar Pradesh, India","Nagpal, S (reprint author), CSIR, Inst Genom & Integrat Biol, New Delhi 110001, India.",koyeli.mapa@snu.edu.in; lipi.thukral@igib.in,,"Thukral, Lipi/0000-0002-1961-039X","INSPIRE Faculty Fellowship from Department of Science and Technology; IYBA fellowship from Department of Biotechnology; CSIR network projects [BSC0123, BSC0124]","LT is funded by INSPIRE Faculty Fellowship from Department of Science and Technology.

One main difficulty, in addition to inaccuracies in energy functions, is the exquisite sensitivity of protein-ligand interactions to subtle conformational changes, coupled with the computational problem of sampling the large conformational search space of degrees of freedom of ligands, amino acid side chains, and the protein backbone. Here, we describe two benchmarks for evaluating the accuracy of computational approaches for re-engineering protein-ligand interactions: (i) prediction of enzyme specificity altering mutations and (ii) prediction of sequence tolerance in ligand binding sites. After finding that current state-of-the-art ""fixed backbone"" design methods perform poorly on these tests, we develop a new ""coupled moves"" design method in the program Rosetta that couples changes to protein sequence with alterations in both protein side-chain and protein backbone conformations, and allows for changes in ligand rigid-body and torsion degrees of freedom. We show significantly increased accuracy in both predicting ligand specificity altering mutations and binding site sequences. These methodological improvements should be useful for many applications of protein - ligand design. The approach also provides insights into the role of subtle conformational adjustments that enable functional changes not only in engineering applications but also in natural protein evolution.","[Ollikainen, Noah; Kortemme, Tanja] Univ Calif San Francisco, Grad Program Bioinformat, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; [de Jong, Rene M.] DSM Biotechnol Ctr, Delft, Netherlands; [Kortemme, Tanja] Univ Calif San Francisco, Calif Inst Quantitat Biosci QB3, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; [Kortemme, Tanja] Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Bioengn & Therapeut Sci, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA","Ollikainen, N (reprint author), Univ Calif San Francisco, Grad Program Bioinformat, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA.",kortemme@cgl.ucsf.edu,,"Kortemme, Tanja/0000-0002-8494-680X","National Institute of Health (US) [R01-GM110089]; National Science Foundation (US) [DBI-1262182, EEC-0540879]","This work was supported by: National Institute of Health (US) R01-GM110089 (TK), National Science Foundation (US) DBI-1262182, PI T.

Several modeling efforts have been used to integrate the complex network of interacting molecular components involved in cell cycle dynamics. In this paper, we aimed at recovering the regulatory logic upstream of previously known components of cell cycle control, with the aim of understanding the mechanisms underlying the emergence of the cyclic behavior of such components. We focus on Arabidopsis thaliana, but given that many components of cell cycle regulation are conserved among eukaryotes, when experimental data for this system was not available, we considered experimental results from yeast and animal systems. We are proposing a Boolean gene regulatory network (GRN) that converges into only one robust limit cycle attractor that closely resembles the cyclic behavior of the key cell-cycle molecular components and other regulators considered here. We validate the model by comparing our in silico configurations with data from loss- and gain-of-function mutants, where the endocyclic behavior also was recovered. Additionally, we approximate a continuous model and recovered the temporal periodic expression profiles of the cell-cycle molecular components involved, thus suggesting that the single limit cycle attractor recovered with the Boolean model is not an artifact of its discrete and synchronous nature, but rather an emergent consequence of the inherent characteristics of the regulatory logic proposed here. This dynamical model, hence provides a novel theoretical framework to address cell cycle regulation in plants, and it can also be used to propose novel predictions regarding cell cycle regulation in other eukaryotes.","[Ortiz-Gutierrez, Elizabeth; Garcia-Cruz, Karla; Azpeitia, Eugenio; Castillo, Aaron; de la Paz Sanchez, Maria; Alvarez-Buylla, Elena R.] Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Inst Ecol, Mexico City 04510, DF, Mexico; [Ortiz-Gutierrez, Elizabeth; Azpeitia, Eugenio; Castillo, Aaron; Alvarez-Buylla, Elena R.] Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Ctr Ciencias Complejidad C3, Mexico City 04510, DF, Mexico","Ortiz-Gutierrez, E (reprint author), Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Inst Ecol, 3er Circuito Exterior, Mexico City 04510, DF, Mexico.",eabuylla@gmail.com,"Sanchez, Maria de la Paz/G-7881-2012","Sanchez, Maria de la Paz/0000-0003-4153-5119", [CONACyT:180098];  [180380];  [152649];  [UNAM-DGAPA-PAPIIT:IN203113];  [IN203814],"This study was financed with the following grants: CONACyT:180098 and 180380 (ERAB), 152649 (MPS); and UNAM-DGAPA-PAPIIT:IN203113 (ERAB) and IN203814 (MPS).

The Pacinian corpuscle (PC), a cutaneous mechanoreceptor located deep within the dermis of the skin, detects high frequency vibrations that occur within its large receptive field. The PC is comprised of lamellae that surround the nerve fiber at its core. We hypothesized that a layered, anisotropic structure, embedded deep within the skin, would produce the nonlinear strain transmission and low spatial sensitivity characteristic of the PC. A multiscale finite-element model was used to model the equilibrium response of the PC to indentation. The first simulation considered an isolated PC with fiber networks aligned with the PC's surface. The PC was subjected to a 10 mu m indentation by a 250 mu m diameter indenter. The multiscale model captured the nonlinear strain transmission through the PC, predicting decreased compressive strain with proximity to the receptor's core, as seen experimentally by others. The second set of simulations considered a single PC embedded epidermally (shallow) or dermally (deep) to model the PC's location within the skin. The embedded models were subjected to 10 mu m indentations at a series of locations on the surface of the skin. Strain along the long axis of the PC was calculated after indentation to simulate stretch along the nerve fiber at the center of the PC. Receptive fields for the epidermis and dermis models were constructed by mapping the long-axis strain after indentation at each point on the surface of the skin mesh. The dermis model resulted in a larger receptive field, as the calculated strain showed less indenter location dependence than in the epidermis model.","[Quindlen, Julia C.; Barocas, Victor H.] Univ Minnesota, Dept Biomed Engn, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA; [Lai, Victor K.] Univ Minnesota, Dept Chem Engn, Duluth, MN 55812 USA","Quindlen, JC (reprint author), Univ Minnesota, Dept Biomed Engn, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA.",baroc001@umn.edu,,,"National Science Foundation Integrative Graduate Education and Research Traineeship fellowship in Systems Neuroengineering [DGE-1069104]; National Institutes of Health [EB005813, EB016638]","This research was supported by a National Science Foundation (http://www.nsf.gov/) Integrative Graduate Education and Research Traineeship (http://www.igert.org/) fellowship in Systems Neuroengineering, Grant Number DGE-1069104.

Key intervention decisions will be determined by both the transmissibility of the novel strain (measured by the basic reproductive number R-0) and its individual-level severity. The 2009 pandemic illustrated that estimating individual-level severity, as described by the proportion p(C) of infections that result in clinical cases, can remain uncertain for a prolonged period of time. Here, we use 50 distinct US military populations during 2009 as a retrospective cohort to test the hypothesis that real-time encounter data combined with disease dynamic models can be used to bridge this uncertainty gap. Effectively, we estimated the total number of infections in multiple early-affected communities using the model and divided that number by the known number of clinical cases. Joint estimates of severity and transmissibility clustered within a relatively small region of parameter space, with 40 of the 50 populations bounded by: p(C), 0.0133-0.150 and R-0, 1.09-2.16. These fits were obtained despite widely varying incidence profiles: some with spring waves, some with fall waves and some with both. To illustrate the benefit of specific pairing of rapidly available data and infectious disease models, we simulated a future moderate pandemic strain with pC approximately x 10 that of 2009; the results demonstrating that even before the peak had passed in the first affected population, R0 and pC could be well estimated. This study provides a clear reference in this two-dimensional space against which future novel respiratory pathogens can be rapidly assessed and compared with previous pandemics.","[Riley, Pete; Ben-Nun, Michal; Linker, Jon A.; Riley, Steven] Predict Sci Inc, San Diego, CA 92122 USA; [Cost, Angelia A.; Sanchez, Jose L.] Armed Forces Hlth Surveillance Ctr, Silver Spring, MD USA; [George, Dylan] US Dept HHS, Biomed Adv Res & Dev Author, Assistant Secretary Preparedness & Response, Washington, DC 20201 USA; [Bacon, David P.] Leidos, Mclean, VA USA; [Riley, Steven] Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, MRC Ctr Outbreak Anal & Modelling, London SW7 2AZ, England","Riley, P (reprint author), Predict Sci Inc, San Diego, CA 92122 USA.",pete@predsci.com,,"Riley, Steven/0000-0001-7904-4804","Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) [HDTRA1-14-C-0031]; Medical Research Council [MR/K010174/1, MR/K010174/1B]","Work performed by PR, MBN, JAL, DPB, and SR was supported by the Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA), contract number: HDTRA1-14-C-0031.

Here we studied how humans select actions under such extrinsic and intrinsic uncertainty, in view of an exponentially expanding number of prospects on a branching multivalued visual stimulus. A triangular grid of disks of different sizes scrolled down a touchscreen at a variable speed. The larger disks represented larger rewards. The task was to maximize the cumulative reward by touching one disk at a time in a rapid sequence, forming an upward path across the grid, while every step along the path constrained the part of the grid accessible in the future. This task captured some of the complexity of natural behavior in the risky and dynamic world, where ongoing decisions alter the landscape of future rewards. By comparing human behavior with behavior of ideal actors, we identified the strategies used by humans in terms of how far into the future they looked (their ""depth of computation"") and how often they attempted to incorporate new information about the future rewards (their ""recalculation period""). We found that, for a given task difficulty, humans traded off their depth of computation for the recalculation period. The form of this tradeoff was consistent with a complete, brute-force exploration of all possible paths up to a resource-limited finite depth. A step-by-step analysis of the human behavior revealed that participants took into account very fine distinctions between the future rewards and that they abstained from some simple heuristics in assessment of the alternative paths, such as seeking only the largest disks or avoiding the smaller disks. The participants preferred to reduce their depth of computation or increase the recalculation period rather than sacrifice the precision of computation.","[Snider, Joseph; Lee, Dongpyo; Poizner, Howard] Univ Calif San Diego, Inst Neural Computat, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Poizner, Howard] Univ Calif San Diego, Grad Program Neurosci, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Gepshtein, Sergei] Salk Inst Biol Studies, Syst Neurobiol Labs, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA","Snider, J (reprint author), Univ Calif San Diego, Inst Neural Computat, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA.",sergei@salk.edu,"Gepshtein, Sergei/D-8245-2016","Gepshtein, Sergei/0000-0002-6328-7972; Snider, Joseph/0000-0002-0176-5107",Office of Naval Research Multidisciplinary University Initiative Grant [N00014-10-1-0072]; National Institutes of Health Grant [EY018613],"This work was supported by Office of Naval Research Multidisciplinary University Initiative Grant N00014-10-1-0072 (HP) and National Institutes of Health Grant EY018613 (SG).

Using a large image database of natural scenes, we trained machine-learning classifiers to derive quantitative measures of task-specific perceptual discriminability based on the distance between individual images and different categorization boundaries.

Reproducibility, and instantaneous repeatability, is built in to the ReproPhylo system and does not require user intervention or configuration because it stores the experimental workflow as a single, serialized Python object containing explicit provenance and environment information. This 'single file' approach ensures the persistence of provenance across iterations of the analysis, with changes automatically managed by the version control program Git. This file, along with a Git repository, are the primary reproducibility outputs of the program.

Although exocytosis mainly occurs at active zones, Syntaxin-1A appears to cover the entire neuronal membrane. By using STED super-resolution light microscopy and image analysis of Drosophila neuro-muscular junctions, we show that Syntaxin-1A clusters are more abundant and have an increased size at active zones. A computational particle-based model of syntaxin cluster formation and dynamics is developed. The model is parametrized to reproduce Syntaxin cluster-size distributions found by STED analysis, and successfully reproduces existing FRAP results. The model shows that the neuronal membrane is adjusted in a way to strike a balance between having most syntaxins stored in large clusters, while still keeping a mobile fraction of syntaxins free or in small clusters that can efficiently search the membrane or be traded between clusters. This balance is subtle and can be shifted toward almost no clustering and almost complete clustering by modifying the syntaxin interaction energy on the order of only 1 k(B)T. This capability appears to be exploited at active zones. The larger active-zone syntaxin clusters are more stable and provide regions of high docking and fusion capability, whereas the smaller clusters outside may serve as flexible reserve pool or sites of spontaneous ectopic release.","[Ullrich, Alexander; Schoeneberg, Johannes; Noe, Frank] Free Univ Berlin, Dept Math, Berlin, Germany; [Boehme, Mathias A.; Depner, Harald; Sigrist, Stephan J.] Free Univ Berlin, Inst Biol Genet, Berlin, Germany; [Boehme, Mathias A.; Sigrist, Stephan J.] Charite, NeuroCure Cluster Excellence, Berlin, Germany","Ullrich, A (reprint author), Free Univ Berlin, Dept Math, Berlin, Germany.",frank.noe@fu-berlin.de,,"Bohme, Mathias/0000-0002-0947-9172","Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) [Sonderforschungsbereich (SFB) 958]; European Commission through ERC starting grant ""pcCell""","Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) through Sonderforschungsbereich (SFB) 958, sponsored AU and MAB.

Existing approaches to predicting drug sensitivity rely primarily on profiling of cancer cell line panels that have been treated with different drugs and selecting genomic or functional genomic features to regress or classify the drug response. Here, we propose a dual-layer integrated cell line-drug network model, which uses both cell line similarity network (CSN) data and drug similarity network (DSN) data to predict the drug response of a given cell line using a weighted model. Using the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE) and Cancer Genome Project (CGP) studies as benchmark datasets, our single-layer model with CSN or DSN and only a single parameter achieved a prediction performance comparable to the previously generated elastic net model. When using the dual-layer model integrating both CSN and DSN, our predicted response reached a 0.6 Pearson correlation coefficient with observed responses for most drugs, which is significantly better than the previous results using the elastic net model. We have also applied the dual-layer cell line-drug integrated network model to fill in the missing drug response values in the CGP dataset. Even though the dual-layer integrated cell line-drug network model does not specifically model mutation information, it correctly predicted that BRAF mutant cell lines would be more sensitive than BRAF wild-type cell lines to three MEK1/2 inhibitors tested.","[Zhang, Naiqian; Fang, Yun; Wang, Jun; Zheng, Xiaoqi] Shanghai Normal Univ, Dept Math, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Wang, Haiyun] Tongji Univ, Sch Life Sci & Technol, Dept Bioinformat, Shanghai 200092, Peoples R China; [Liu, X.

Unfortunately, a myriad of difficulties in overexpression and reconstitution into membrane mimetics severely limit our ability to determine their structures. Computational tools are therefore instrumental to membrane protein structure prediction, consequently increasing our understanding of membrane protein function and their role in disease. Here, we describe a general framework facilitating membrane protein modeling and design that combines the scientific principles for membrane protein modeling with the flexible software architecture of Rosetta3. This new framework, called RosettaMP, provides a general membrane representation that interfaces with scoring, conformational sampling, and mutation routines that can be easily combined to create new protocols. To demonstrate the capabilities of this implementation, we developed four proof-of-concept applications for (1) prediction of free energy changes upon mutation; (2) high-resolution structural refinement; (3) protein-protein docking; and (4) assembly of symmetric protein complexes, all in the membrane environment. Preliminary data show that these algorithms can produce meaningful scores and structures. The data also suggest needed improvements to both sampling routines and score functions. Importantly, the applications collectively demonstrate the potential of combining the flexible nature of RosettaMP with the power of Rosetta algorithms to facilitate membrane protein modeling and design.","[Alford, Rebecca F.; Leman, Julia Koehler; Weitzner, Brian D.; Gray, Jeffrey J.] Johns Hopkins Univ, Dept Biomol & Chem Engn, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA; [Alford, Rebecca F.] Carnegie Mellon Univ, Dept Chem, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA; [Duran, Amanda M.] Vanderbilt Univ, Dept Chem, Struct Biol Ctr, Nashville, TN USA; [Tilley, Drew C.] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Physiol & Membrane Biol, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Elazar, Assaf] Weizmann Inst Sci, Dept Biol Chem, IL-76100 Rehovot, Israel","Alford, RF (reprint author), Johns Hopkins Univ, Dept Biomol & Chem Engn, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA.",jgray@jhu.edu,,"Weitzner, Brian/0000-0002-1909-0961; Alford, Rebecca/0000-0003-0306-8476",NIH [R01 GM-078221],"Funding was provided by NIH R01 GM-078221 to RFA, BDW, and JJG, and Rosetta Commons to JKL.

In these diseases, the aggregation of one or a few specific proteins is often toxic, leading to cellular degeneration and/or organ disruption in addition to the loss-of-function resulting from protein misfolding. Although the pathophysiological consequences of these diseases are overt, the molecular dysregulations leading to aggregate toxicity are still unclear and appear to be diverse and multifactorial. The molecular mechanisms of protein aggregation and therefore the biophysical parameters favoring protein aggregation are better understood. Here we perform an in silico survey of the impact of human sequence variation on the aggregation propensity of human proteins. We find that disease-associated variations are statistically significantly enriched in mutations that increase the aggregation potential of human proteins when compared to neutral sequence variations. These findings suggest that protein aggregation might have a broader impact on human disease than generally assumed and that beyond loss-of-function, the aggregation of mutant proteins involved in cancer, immune disorders or inflammation could potentially further contribute to disease by additional burden on cellular protein homeostasis.","[De Baets, Greet; Van Doorn, Loic; Rousseau, Frederic; Schymkowitz, Joost] VIB, Flanders Inst Biotechnol, VIB Switch Lab, Leuven, Belgium; [De Baets, Greet; Van Doorn, Loic; Rousseau, Frederic; Schymkowitz, Joost] Univ Leuven, Dept Cellular & Mol Med, SWITCH Lab, Leuven, Belgium","De Baets, G (reprint author), VIB, Flanders Inst Biotechnol, VIB Switch Lab, Leuven, Belgium.",Frederic.Rousseau@switch.vib-kuleuven.be; Joost.Schymkowitz@switch.vib-kuleuven.be,"Rousseau, Frederic/J-9044-2016; Schymkowitz, Joost/K-7764-2016; De Baets, Greet/J-1881-2014","Rousseau, Frederic/0000-0002-9189-7399; Schymkowitz, Joost/0000-0003-2020-0168; De Baets, Greet/0000-0001-8844-800X",Interuniversity Attraction Poles (IAP Network 6/43) of Belgian Federal Science Policy Office (BelSPo); Hercules Foundation [AKUL005 HER/08/061]; IWT fellowship; PDMK grant from University of Leuven,"This work was supported by a grant from the Interuniversity Attraction Poles (IAP Network 6/43) of the Belgian Federal Science Policy Office (BelSPo), the Hercules Foundation (AKUL005 HER/08/061).

Yet these schemes do not discuss how these units sit relative to each other in a global structure space. In this paper we construct networks that describe such global relationships between folds in the form of structural bridges. We generate these networks using four different structural alignment methods across multiple score thresholds. The networks constructed using the different methods remain a similar distance apart regardless of the probability threshold defining a structural bridge. This suggests that at least some structural bridges are method specific and that any attempt to build a picture of structural space should not be reliant on a single structural superposition method. Despite these differences all representations agree on an organisation of fold space into five principal community structures: all-alpha, all-beta sandwiches, all-beta barrels, alpha/beta and alpha + beta. We project estimated fold ages onto the networks and find that not only are the pairings of unconnected folds associated with higher age differences than bridged folds, but this difference increases with the number of networks displaying an edge. We also examine different centrality measures for folds within the networks and how these relate to fold age. While these measures interpret the central core of fold space in varied ways they all identify the disposition of ancestral folds to fall within this core and that of the more recently evolved structures to provide the peripheral landscape. These findings suggest that evolutionary information is encoded along these structural bridges. Finally, we identify four highly central pivotal folds representing dominant topological features which act as key attractors within our landscapes.","[Edwards, Hannah; Deane, Charlotte M.] Univ Oxford, Dept Stat, Oxford OX1 3TG, England","Edwards, H (reprint author), Univ Oxford, Dept Stat, Oxford OX1 3TG, England.",deane@stats.ox.ac.uk,,"Deane, Charlotte/0000-0003-1388-2252","Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council UK (EPSRC) [EP/G03706X/1, EP/M508111/1]","This work has been supported by two grants (EP/G03706X/1 and EP/M508111/1) from the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council UK (EPSRC) http://www.epsrc.ac.uk/.

Although individuals can gain critical benefits from their position in a hierarchy, we do not understand how real-world hierarchies form. Nor do we understand what signals and decision-rules individuals use to construct and maintain hierarchies in the absence of simple cues such as size or spatial location. A study of conflict in two groups of captive monk parakeets (Myiopsitta monachus) found that a transition to large-scale order in aggression occurred in newly-formed groups after one week, with individuals thereafter preferring to direct aggression more frequently against those nearby in rank. We consider two cognitive mechanisms underlying the emergence of this order: inference based on overall levels of aggression, or on subsets of the aggression network. Both mechanisms were predictive of individual decisions to aggress, but observed patterns were better explained by rank inference through subsets of the aggression network. Based on these results, we present a new theory, of a feedback loop between knowledge of rank and consequent behavior. This loop explains the transition to strategic aggression and the formation and persistence of dominance hierarchies in groups capable of both social memory and inference.","[Hobson, Elizabeth A.] Univ Tennessee, Natl Inst Math & Biol Synth, Knoxville, TN 37996 USA; [Hobson, Elizabeth A.] New Mexico State Univ, Dept Biol, Las Cruces, NM 88003 USA; [DeDeo, Simon] Indiana Univ, Sch Informat & Comp, Dept Informat, Bloomington, IN USA; [DeDeo, Simon] Santa Fe Inst, Santa Fe, NM 87501 USA","Hobson, EA (reprint author), Univ Tennessee, Natl Inst Math & Biol Synth, Knoxville, TN 37996 USA.",ehobson@nimbios.org,,,"New Mexico Higher Education Graduate Fellowship; Loustaunau Fellowship; National Science Foundation (NSF) GK-12 DISSECT Fellowship [DGE-0947465]; Associated Students of New Mexico State University; American Ornithologists' Union; Sigma Xi; NMSU Biology Graduate Student Organization; NSF [IOS-0725032, EF-1137929]; U.S. Department of Homeland Security; U.S. Department of Agriculture through NSF [DBI-1300426]; University of Tennessee, Knoxville; Santa Fe Institute","EAH was supported by the New Mexico Higher Education Graduate Fellowship, Loustaunau Fellowship, and National Science Foundation (NSF) GK-12 DISSECT (#DGE-0947465) Fellowship, research grants from the Associated Students of New Mexico State University, American Ornithologists' Union, Sigma Xi, and the NMSU Biology Graduate Student Organization, with further support from NSF Grant #IOS-0725032 and associated REU supplement to Timothy Wright.

In effect this means that a growth of one population, needs to be balanced by comparable reduction in populations of others. In neutral models of biodiversity all populations are assumed to change incrementally due to stochastic births and deaths of individuals. Here we propose and model another redistribution mechanism driven by abrupt and severe reduction in size of the population of a single species freeing up resources for the remaining ones. This mechanism may be relevant e.g. for communities of bacteria, with strain-specific collapses caused e.g. by invading bacteriophages, or for other ecosystems where infectious diseases play an important role. The emergent dynamics of our system is characterized by cyclic ""diversity waves'' triggered by collapses of globally dominating populations. The population diversity peaks at the beginning of each wave and exponentially decreases afterwards. Species abundances have bimodal time-aggregated distribution with the lower peak formed by populations of recently collapsed or newly introduced species while the upper peak - species that has not yet collapsed in the current wave. In most waves both upper and lower peaks are composed of several smaller peaks. This self-organized hierarchical peak structure has a long-term memory transmitted across several waves. It gives rise to a scale-free tail of the time-aggregated population distribution with a universal exponent of 1.7. We show that diversity wave dynamics is robust with respect to variations in the rules of our model such as diffusion between multiple environments, species-specific growth and extinction rates, and bet-hedging strategies.","[Maslov, Sergei] Univ Illinois, Dept Bioengn, Champaign, IL 60607 USA; [Maslov, Sergei] Univ Illinois, Carl R Woese Inst Genom Biol, Champaign, IL USA; [Maslov, Sergei] Brookhaven Natl Lab, Biol Environm & Climate Sci Dept, Upton, NY 11973 USA; [Sneppen, Kim] Univ Copenhagen, Niels Bohr Inst, Ctr Models Life, DK-2100 Copenhagen, Denmark","Maslov, S (reprint author), Univ Illinois, Dept Bioengn, Champaign, IL 60607 USA.",ssmaslov@gmail.com,"Maslov, Sergei/C-2397-2009","Maslov, Sergei/0000-0002-3701-492X; Sneppen, Kim/0000-0001-9820-3567",Office of Biological Research of the U.S. Department of Energy [PM-031]; Danish National Research Foundation,"Work at Brookhaven was supported by grants PM-031 from the Office of Biological Research of the U.S. Department of Energy.

The ideal global solution for this experiment design problem is generally computationally intractable because of parametric uncertainties in the mathematical model of the biological system. Others have addressed this issue by limiting the solution to a local estimate of the model parameters. Here we present an approach that is independent of the local parameter constraint. This approach is made computationally efficient and tractable by the use of: (1) sparse grid interpolation that approximates the biological system dynamics, (2) representative parameters that uniformly represent the data-consistent dynamical space, and (3) probability weights of the represented experimentally distinguishable dynamics. Our approach identifies data-consistent representative parameters using sparse grid interpolants, constructs the optimal input sequence from a greedy search, and defines the associated optimal measurements using a scenario tree. We explore the optimality of this MBDOE algorithm using a 3-dimensional Hes1 model and a 19-dimensional T-cell receptor model. The 19-dimensional T-cell model also demonstrates the MBDOE algorithm's scalability to higher dimensions. In both cases, the dynamical uncertainty region that bounds the trajectories of the target system states were reduced by as much as 86% and 99% respectively after completing the designed experiments in silico. Our results suggest that for resolving dynamical uncertainty, the ability to design an input sequence paired with its associated measurements is particularly important when limited by the number of measurements.","[Mdluli, Thembi; Rundell, Ann E.] Purdue Univ, Weldon Sch Biomed Engn, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA; [Buzzard, Gregery T.] Purdue Univ, Dept Math, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA","Mdluli, T (reprint author), Purdue Univ, Weldon Sch Biomed Engn, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA.",tmdluli@purdue.edu; rundell@purdue.edu,,,NSF [DMS-0900277],"This research was supported in part by the NSF grant DMS-0900277.

Here, we consider a simple model of evolution in asexually reproducing populations which considers adaptation as a biased random walk on a fitness landscape. This model associates the global properties of the fitness landscape with the algebraic properties of a Markov chain transition matrix and allows us to derive general results on the non-commutativity and irreversibility of natural selection as well as antibiotic cycling strategies. Using this formalism, we analyze 15 empirical fitness landscapes of E. coli under selection by different beta-lactam antibiotics and demonstrate that the emergence of resistance to a given antibiotic can be either hindered or promoted by different sequences of drug application. Specifically, we demonstrate that the majority, approximately 70%, of sequential drug treatments with 2-4 drugs promote resistance to the final antibiotic. Further, we derive optimal drug application sequences with which we can probabilistically 'steer' the population through genotype space to avoid the emergence of resistance. This suggests a new strategy in the war against antibiotic-resistant organisms: drug sequencing to shepherd evolution through genotype space to states from which resistance cannot emerge and by which to maximize the chance of successful therapy.","[Nichol, Daniel; Jeavons, Peter] Univ Oxford, Dept Comp Sci, Oxford, England; [Nichol, Daniel; Gatenby, Robert A.; Anderson, Alexander R.

Measuring [Ca2+](i) flux is central to the study of mechanisms that underlie both normal cardiac function and calcium-dependent etiologies in heart disease. However, current imaging techniques are limited in the spatial resolution to which changes in [Ca2+](i) can be detected. Using spatial point process statistics techniques we developed a novel method to simulate the spatial distribution of RyR clusters, which act as the major mediators of contractile Ca2+ release, upon a physiologically-realistic cellular landscape composed of tightly-packed mitochondria and myofibrils. We applied this method to computationally combine confocal-scale (similar to 200 nm) data of RyR clusters with 3D electron microscopy data (similar to 30 nm) of myofibrils and mitochondria, both collected from adult rat left ventricular myocytes. Using this hybrid-scale spatial model, we simulated reaction-diffusion of [Ca2+](i) during the rising phase of the transient (first 30 ms after initiation). At 30 ms, the average peak of the simulated [Ca2+](i) transient and of the simulated fluorescence intensity signal, F/F-0, reached values similar to that found in the literature ([Ca2+](i) approximate to 1 mu M; F/F-0 approximate to 5.5). However, our model predicted the variation in [Ca2+](i) to be between 0.3 and 12.7 mu M (similar to 3 to 100 fold from resting value of 0.1 mu M) and the corresponding F/F-0 signal ranging from 3 to 9.5. We demonstrate in this study that: (i) heterogeneities in the [Ca2+](i) transient are due not only to heterogeneous distribution and clustering of mitochondria; (ii) but also to heterogeneous local densities of RyR clusters. Further, we show that: (iii) these structure-induced heterogeneities in [Ca2+](i) can appear in line scan data. Finally, using our unique method for generating RyR cluster distributions, we demonstrate the robustness in the [Ca2+](i) transient to differences in RyR cluster distributions measured between rat and human cardiomyocytes.","[Rajagopal, Vijay] Univ Melbourne, Dept Mech Engn, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Rajagopal, Vijay] Univ Auckland, Auckland Bioengn Inst, Auckland 1, New Zealand; [Rajagopal, Vijay; Bass, Gregory; Crampin, Edmund J.] Univ Melbourne, Melbourne Sch Engn, Syst Biol Lab, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Walker, Cameron G.] Univ Auckland, Dept Engn Sci, Auckland, New Zealand; [Crossman, David J.] Univ Auckland, Dept Physiol, Auckland, New Zealand; [Petzer, Amorita; Hickey, Anthony] Univ Auckland, Sch Biol Sci, Auckland 1, New Zealand; [Hoshijima, Masahiko] Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Med, San Diego, CA 92103 USA; [Hoshijima, Masahiko; Ellisman, Mark H.] Univ Calif San Diego, Natl Ctr Microscopy & Imaging Res, San Diego, CA 92103 USA; [Crampin, Edmund J.] Univ Melbourne, Sch Math & Stat, Fac Sci, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Crampin, Edmund J.] Univ Melbourne, Sch Med, Fac Med Dent & Hlth Sci, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Crampin, Edmund J.] Univ Melbourne, ARC Ctr Excellence Convergent Bionano Sci & Techn, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Soeller, Christian] Univ Exeter, Biomed Phys, Exeter, Devon, England","Rajagopal, V (reprint author), Univ Melbourne, Dept Mech Engn, Melbourne, Vic, Australia.",vijay.rajagopal@unimelb.edu.au,"Rajagopal, Vijay/D-7116-2014; Siekmann, Ivo/N-9725-2019","Rajagopal, Vijay/0000-0002-5509-402X; Siekmann, Ivo/0000-0002-0706-6307; Walker, Cameron/0000-0003-3176-9341",Royal Society of New Zealand Marsden Fast Start Grant [11-UOA-184]; Human Frontiers Science Program Research Grant [RGP0027/2013]; University of Melbourne Dyason Fellowship; Victorian Life Sciences Computation Initiative (VLSCI) [VR0313],"This study was partly supported by the Royal Society of New Zealand Marsden Fast Start Grant 11-UOA-184 (http://www.royalsociety.org.nz/programmes/funds/marsden/), the Human Frontiers Science Program Research Grant RGP0027/2013 (http://www.hfsp.org), and the University of Melbourne Dyason Fellowship.

While reliable methods have long existed to adjust parameters such that the first-order statistics of network dynamics are conserved, here we show that limitations already arise if also second-order statistics are to be maintained. The temporal structure of pairwise averaged correlations in the activity of recurrent networks is determined by the effective population-level connectivity. We first show that in general the converse is also true and explicitly mention degenerate cases when this one-to-one relationship does not hold. The one-to-one correspondence between effective connectivity and the temporal structure of pairwise averaged correlations implies that network scalings should preserve the effective connectivity if pairwise averaged correlations are to be held constant. Changes in effective connectivity can even push a network from a linearly stable to an unstable, oscillatory regime and vice versa. On this basis, we derive conditions for the preservation of both mean population-averaged activities and pairwise averaged correlations under a change in numbers of neurons or synapses in the asynchronous regime typical of cortical networks. We find that mean activities and correlation structure can be maintained by an appropriate scaling of the synaptic weights, but only over a range of numbers of synapses that is limited by the variance of external inputs to the network. Our results therefore show that the reducibility of asynchronous networks is fundamentally limited.","[van Albada, Sacha Jennifer; Helias, Moritz; Diesmann, Markus] Julich Res ctr, Inst Neurosci & Med INM 6, Julich, Germany; [van Albada, Sacha Jennifer; Helias, Moritz; Diesmann, Markus] Julich Res Ctr, Inst Adv Simulat IAS 6, Julich, Germany; [van Albada, Sacha Jennifer; Helias, Moritz; Diesmann, Markus] Julich Res Ctr, JARA BRAIN Inst 1, Julich, Germany; [Diesmann, Markus] Rhein Westfal TH Aachen, Fac Med, Dept Psychiat Psychotherapy & Psychosomat, Aachen, Germany; [Diesmann, Markus] Rhein Westfal TH Aachen, Dept Phys, Fac 1, Aachen, Germany","van Albada, SJ (reprint author), Julich Res ctr, Inst Neurosci & Med INM 6, Julich, Germany.",s.van.albada@fz-juelich.de,"Helias, Moritz/B-1614-2014; Diesmann, Markus/H-3722-2013; van Albada, Sacha J/M-6112-2013","Helias, Moritz/0000-0002-0404-8656; Diesmann, Markus/0000-0002-2308-5727; van Albada, Sacha J/0000-0003-0682-4855","European Union [269921, 604102]; Helmholtz Association: portfolio theme Supercomputing and Modeling for the Human Brain (SMHB); Helmholtz young investigator's group [VH-NG-1028]","We acknowledge funding by the Helmholtz Association: portfolio theme Supercomputing and Modeling for the Human Brain (SMHB) (MD) and Helmholtz young investigator's group VH-NG-1028 (MH); and European Union Grants 269921 (BrainScaleS) (SJvA, MD) and 604102 (Human Brain Project, HBP) (MD).

Expanding our recent efforts for mammalian mirtron annotation, we use meta-analysis of aggregate datasets to identify similar to 500 novel mouse and human introns that confidently generate diced small RNA duplexes. These comprise nearly 1000 total loci distributed in four splicing-mediated biogenesis subclasses, with 5'-tailed mirtrons as, by far, the dominant subtype. Thus, mirtrons surprisingly comprise a substantial fraction of endogenous Dicer substrates in mammalian genomes. Although mirtron-derived small RNAs exhibit overall expression correlation with their host mRNAs, we observe a subset with substantial differences that suggest regulated processing or accumulation. We identify characteristic sequence, length, and structural features of mirtron loci that distinguish them from bulk introns, and find that mirtrons preferentially emerge from genes with larger numbers of introns. While mirtrons generate miRNA-class regulatory RNAs, we also find that mirtrons exhibit many features that distinguish them from canonical miRNAs. We observe that conventional mirtron hairpins are substantially longer than Drosha-generated pre-miRNAs, indicating that the characteristic length of canonical pre-miRNAs is not a general feature of Dicer substrate hairpins. In addition, mammalian mirtrons exhibit unique patterns of ordered 5' and 3' heterogeneity, which reveal hidden complexity in miRNA processing pathways. These include broad 3'-uridylation of mirtron hairpins, atypically heterogeneous 5' termini that may result from exonucleolytic processing, and occasionally robust decapitation of the 5' guanine (G) of mirtron-5p species defined by splicing. Altogether, this study reveals that this extensive class of non-canonical miRNA bears a multitude of characteristic properties, many of which raise general mechanistic questions regarding the processing of endogenous hairpin transcripts.","[Wen, Jiayu; Ladewig, Erik; Shenker, Sol; Mohammed, Jaaved; Lai, Eric C.] Sloan Kettering Inst, Dept Dev Biol, New York, NY 10065 USA; [Shenker, Sol; Mohammed, Jaaved] Weill Cornell Med Coll, Triinst Program Computat Biol & Med, New York, NY USA","Wen, JY (reprint author), Sloan Kettering Inst, Dept Dev Biol, New York, NY 10065 USA.",laie@mskcc.org,"Wen, Jiayu/R-1673-2017","Wen, Jiayu/0000-0003-1249-6456; Mohammed, Jaaved/0000-0002-7053-5575; Lai, Eric/0000-0002-8432-5851","National Institutes of Health [R01-GM083300, R01-NS083833]; Tri-Institutional Training Program in Computational Biology and Medicine","JW, EL, and ECL were supported by the National Institutes of Health grants R01-GM083300 and R01-NS083833.

These experiments revealed that a large fraction of TF binding events occur in regions where only a small number of specific TF binding sites (TFBSs) have been detected. Furthermore, in vitro protein-DNA binding measurements performed for hundreds of TFs indicate that TFs are bound with wide range of affinities to different DNA sequences that lack known consensus motifs. These observations have thus challenged the classical picture of specific protein-DNA binding and strongly suggest the existence of additional recognition mechanisms that affect protein-DNA binding preferences. We have previously demonstrated that repetitive DNA sequence elements characterized by certain symmetries statistically affect protein-DNA binding preferences. We call this binding mechanism nonconsensus protein-DNA binding in order to emphasize the point that specific consensus TFBSs do not contribute to this effect. In this paper, using the simple statistical mechanics model developed previously, we calculate the nonconsensus protein-DNA binding free energy for the entire C. elegans and D. melanogaster genomes. Using the available chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (ChIP-seq) results on TF-DNA binding preferences for similar to 100 TFs, we show that DNA sequences characterized by low predicted free energy of nonconsensus binding have statistically higher experimental TF occupancy and lower nucleosome occupancy than sequences characterized by high free energy of nonconsensus binding. This is in agreement with our previous analysis performed for the yeast genome. We suggest therefore that nonconsensus protein-DNA binding assists the formation of nucleosome-free regions, as TFs outcompete nucleosomes at genomic locations with enhanced nonconsensus binding. In addition, here we perform a new, large-scale analysis using in vitro TF-DNA preferences obtained from the universal protein binding microarrays (PBM) for similar to 90 eukaryotic TFs belonging to 22 different DNA-binding domain types. As a result of this new analysis, we conclude that nonconsensus protein-DNA binding is a widespread phenomenon that significantly affects protein-DNA binding preferences and need not require the presence of consensus (specific) TFBSs in order to achieve genome-wide TF-DNA binding specificity.","[Afek, Ariel; Cohen, Hila; Barber-Zucker, Shiran; Lukatsky, David B.] Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Dept Chem, Beer Sheva, Israel; [Gordan, Raluca] Duke Univ, Dept Biostat & Bioinformat, Ctr Genom & Computat Biol, Durham, NC USA","Afek, A (reprint author), Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Dept Chem, Beer Sheva, Israel.",lukatsky@bgu.ac.il,,"Barber-Zucker, Shiran/0000-0003-1835-730X",Israel Science Foundation (ISF) [1014/09]; Alfred P.

A popular theoretical scenario for modeling memory function is the attractor neural network scenario, whose prototype is the Hopfield model. The model simplicity and the locality of the synaptic update rules come at the cost of a poor storage capacity, compared with the capacity achieved with perceptron learning algorithms. Here, by transforming the perceptron learning rule, we present an online learning rule for a recurrent neural network that achieves near-maximal storage capacity without an explicit supervisory error signal, relying only upon locally accessible information. The fully-connected network consists of excitatory binary neurons with plastic recurrent connections and non-plastic inhibitory feedback stabilizing the network dynamics; the memory patterns to be memorized are presented online as strong afferent currents, producing a bimodal distribution for the neuron synaptic inputs. Synapses corresponding to active inputs are modified as a function of the value of the local fields with respect to three thresholds. Above the highest threshold, and below the lowest threshold, no plasticity occurs. In between these two thresholds, potentiation/depression occurs when the local field is above/below an intermediate threshold. We simulated and analyzed a network of binary neurons implementing this rule and measured its storage capacity for different sizes of the basins of attraction. The storage capacity obtained through numerical simulations is shown to be close to the value predicted by analytical calculations. We also measured the dependence of capacity on the strength of external inputs. Finally, we quantified the statistics of the resulting synaptic connectivity matrix, and found that both the fraction of zero weight synapses and the degree of symmetry of the weight matrix increase with the number of stored patterns.","[Alemi, Alireza; Baldassi, Carlo; Zecchina, Riccardo] Human Genet Fdn HuGeF, Turin, Italy; [Alemi, Alireza; Baldassi, Carlo; Zecchina, Riccardo] Politecn Torino, DISAT, Turin, Italy; [Brunel, Nicolas] Univ Chicago, Dept Stat, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Brunel, Nicolas] Univ Chicago, Dept Neurobiol, Chicago, IL 60637 USA","Alemi, A (reprint author), Human Genet Fdn HuGeF, Turin, Italy.",alireza.alemi@hugef-torino.it,"Baldassi, Carlo/I-2212-2017; Baldassi, Carlo/Q-4643-2019","Baldassi, Carlo/0000-0002-5451-8388; ZECCHINA, Riccardo/0000-0002-1221-5207; Alemi, Alireza/0000-0002-5811-775X",European Research Council [267915],"AA, CB and RZ acknowledge the European Research Council (http://erc.europa.eu) for grant No. 267915.

A candidate mechanism for mediating such refinement is spike-timing dependent plasticity (STDP), which translates correlated activity patterns into changes in synaptic strength. To assess the potential of these phenomena to build useful structure in developing neural circuits, we examined the interaction of wave activity with STDP rules in simple, biologically plausible models of spiking neurons. We derive an expression for the synaptic strength dynamics showing that, by mapping the time dependence of STDP into spatial interactions, traveling waves can build periodic synaptic connectivity patterns into feedforward circuits with a broad class of experimentally observed STDP rules. The spatial scale of the connectivity patterns increases with wave speed and STDP time constants. We verify these results with simulations and demonstrate their robustness to likely sources of noise. We show how this pattern formation ability, which is analogous to solutions of reaction-diffusion systems that have been widely applied to biological pattern formation, can be harnessed to instruct the refinement of postsynaptic receptive fields. Our results hold for rich, complex wave patterns in two dimensions and over several orders of magnitude in wave speeds and STDP time constants, and they provide predictions that can be tested under existing experimental paradigms. Our model generalizes across brain areas and STDP rules, allowing broad application to the ubiquitous occurrence of traveling waves and to wave-like activity patterns induced by moving stimuli.","[Bennett, James E.

For a correlated signal, this dynamic range constraint can be relieved by subtracting away components of the signal that can be predicted from the past, a strategy known as predictive coding, that relies on learning the input statistics. However, the statistics of input natural signals can also vary over very short time scales e.g., following saccades across a visual scene. To maintain a reduced transmission cost to signals with rapidly varying statistics, neuronal circuits implementing predictive coding must also rapidly adapt their properties. Experimentally, in different sensory modalities, sensory neurons have shown such adaptations within 100 ms of an input change. Here, we show first that linear neurons connected in a feedback inhibitory circuit can implement predictive coding. We then show that adding a rectification nonlinearity to such a feedback inhibitory circuit allows it to automatically adapt and approximate the performance of an optimal linear predictive coding network, over a wide range of inputs, while keeping its underlying temporal and synaptic properties unchanged. We demonstrate that the resulting changes to the linearized temporal filters of this nonlinear network match the fast adaptations observed experimentally in different sensory modalities, in different vertebrate species. Therefore, the nonlinear feedback inhibitory network can provide automatic adaptation to fast varying signals, maintaining the dynamic range necessary for accurate neuronal transmission of natural inputs.","[Bharioke, Arjun; Chklovskii, Dmitri B.] Howard Hughes Med Inst, Ashburn, VA 20147 USA","Bharioke, A (reprint author), Howard Hughes Med Inst, Janelia Res Campus, Ashburn, VA 20147 USA.",bharioke@gmail.com,,,Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI); University of Cambridge; Janelia Farm Research Campus; Postgraduate Scholarship from National Science and Engineering Research Council of Canada,"This work was funded by the Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI).

Longitudinal metabolic concentration data of 47 individuals from 4 different groups were examined, obtained from a cycle ergometry cohort study. In total, 110 metabolites (within the classes of acylcarnitines, amino acids, and sugars) were measured through a targeted metabolomics approach, combining tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) with the concept of stable isotope dilution (SID) for metabolite quantitation. Biomarker candidates were selected by combined analysis of maximum fold changes (MFCs) in concentrations and P-values resulting from statistical hypothesis testing. Characteristic kinetic signatures were identified through a mathematical modeling approach utilizing polynomial fitting. Modeled kinetic signatures were analyzed for groups with similar behavior by applying hierarchical cluster analysis. Kinetic shape templates were characterized, defining different forms of basic kinetic response patterns, such as sustained, early, late, and other forms, that can be used for metabolite classification. Acetylcarnitine (C2), showing a late response pattern and having the highest values in MFC and statistical significance, was classified as late marker and ranked as strong predictor (MFC = 1.97, P < 0.001). In the class of amino acids, highest values were shown for alanine (MFC = 1.42, P < 0.001), classified as latemarker and strong predictor. Glucose yields a delayed response pattern, similar to a hockey stick function, being classified as delayed marker and ranked as moderate predictor (MFC = 1.32, P < 0.001). These findings coincide with existing knowledge on central metabolic pathways affected in exercise physiology, such as beta-oxidation of fatty acids, glycolysis, and glycogenolysis. The presented modeling approach demonstrates high potential for dynamic biomarker identification and the investigation of kinetic mechanisms in disease or pharmacodynamics studies using MS data from longitudinal cohort studies.","[Breit, Marc; Netzer, Michael; Weinberger, Klaus M.; Baumgartner, Christian] Univ Hlth Sci Med Informat & Technol UMIT, Inst Elect & Biomed Engn, Res Grp Clin Bioinformat, Hall In Tirol, Austria; [Weinberger, Klaus M.] sAnalytiCo Ltd, Belfast, Antrim, North Ireland; [Baumgartner, Christian] Graz Univ Technol, Inst Hlth Care Engn European Notified Body Med De, A-8010 Graz, Austria","Breit, M (reprint author), Univ Hlth Sci Med Informat & Technol UMIT, Inst Elect & Biomed Engn, Res Grp Clin Bioinformat, Hall In Tirol, Austria.",m.breit@umit.at; christian.baumgartner@tugraz.at,,"Baumgartner, Christian/0000-0002-3763-5195; Weinberger, Klaus/0000-0002-8947-5306",,,,97,3,3,1,20,PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE,SAN FRANCISCO,"1160 BATTERY STREET, STE 100, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94111 USA",1553-7358,,,PLOS COMPUT BIOL,PLoS Comput.

By forming energetically favorable contacts with each other these amphiphilic building blocks give rise to the formation of a tertiary structure. Small proteins and peptides, on the other hand, are usually too short to form multiple structural elements and cannot stabilize them internally. Therefore, these molecules are often found to be structurally ambiguous up to the point of a large degree of intrinsic disorder in solution. Consequently, their conformational preference is particularly susceptible to environmental conditions such as pH, salts, or presence of interfaces. In this study we use molecular dynamics simulations to analyze the conformational behavior of two synthetic peptides, LKKLLKLLKKLLKL (LK) and EAA LAEALAEALAE (EALA), with built-in secondary amphiphilicity upon forming an alpha-helix. We use these model peptides to systematically study their aggregation and the influence of macroscopic and molecular interfaces on their conformational preferences. We show that the peptides are neither random coils in bulk water nor fully formed alpha helices, but adopt multiple conformations and secondary structure elements with short lifetimes. These provide a basis for conformation-selection and population-shift upon environmental changes. Differences in these peptides' response to macroscopic and molecular interfaces (presented by an aggregation partner) can be linked to their inherent alpha-helical tendencies in bulk water. We find that the peptides' aggregation behavior is also strongly affected by presence or absence of an interface, and rather subtly depends on their surface charge and hydrophobicity.","[Dalgicdir, Cahit; Sayar, Mehmet] Koc Univ, Coll Engn, Istanbul, Turkey; [Globisch, Christoph; Peter, Christine] Univ Konstanz, Theoret Chem, Constance, Germany","Dalgicdir, C (reprint author), Koc Univ, Coll Engn, Istanbul, Turkey.",christine.peter@uni-konstanz.de; msayar@ku.edu.tr,,,"Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey [212T184]; Max-Planck Society; German Research Foundation [PE 1625/1, PE 1625/3]","This work was supported by: 1) The Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey, http://www.tubitak.gov.tr/en, grant no. 212T184 to CD & MS; 2) Max-Planck Society, http://www.mpg.de/en Financial support through the Partner Group Agreement to MS; and 3) German Research Foundation, http://www.dfg.de/en/, grant PE 1625/1 and PE 1625/3 to CP.

How is this renewal controlled and homeostasis maintained, particularly given the rapid nature of this process? Here, based on the recent observations from in vitro ""mini gut"" studies, we use a hybrid stochastic model of the crypt to investigate how exogenous niche signaling ( from Wnt and BMP) combines with auto-regulation to promote homeostasis. This model builds on the sub-cellular element method to account for the three-dimensional structure of the crypt, external regulation by Wnt and BMP, internal regulation by Notch signaling, as well as regulation by internally generated diffusible signals. Results show that Paneth cell derived Wnt signals, which have been observed experimentally to sustain crypts in cultured organs, have a dramatically different influence on niche dynamics than does mesenchyme derived Wnt. While this signaling can indeed act as a redundant backup to the exogenous gradient, it introduces a positive feedback that destabilizes the niche and causes its uncontrolled expansion. We find that in this setting, BMP has a critical role in constraining this expansion, consistent with observations that its removal leads to crypt fission. Further results also point to a new hypothesis for the role of Ephrin mediated motility of Paneth cells, specifically that it is required to constrain niche expansion and maintain the crypt's spatial structure. Combined, these provide an alternative view of crypt homeostasis where the niche is in a constant state of expansion and the spatial structure of the crypt arises as a balance between this expansion and the action of various sources of negative regulation that hold it in check.","[Du, Huijing; Nie, Qing; Holmes, William R.] Univ Calif Irvine, Ctr Complex Biol Syst, Irvine, CA 92697 USA; [Du, Huijing; Nie, Qing; Holmes, William R.] Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Math, Irvine, CA 92717 USA; [Holmes, William R.] Vanderbilt Univ, Dept Phys & Astron, Nashville, TN 37235 USA","Du, HJ (reprint author), Univ Calif Irvine, Ctr Complex Biol Syst, Irvine, CA 92697 USA.",qnie@math.uci.edu; william.holmes@vanderbilt.edu,"Du, Huijing/K-9628-2019; Holmes, William/J-7434-2018","Holmes, William/0000-0001-6683-4647","National Institutes of Health [R01GM107264, R01DE023050, P50GM76516]; National Science Foundation [DMS1161621]","QN was supported by National Institutes of Health grants R01GM107264, R01DE023050, and P50GM76516 and National Science Foundation grant DMS1161621.

Although clearly adaptive, the way in which division of labor first evolved remains enigmatic, as it requires the simultaneous co-occurrence of several complex traits to achieve the required degree of coordination. Recently, evolutionary swarm robotics has emerged as an excellent test bed to study the evolution of coordinated group-level behavior. Here we use this framework for the first time to study the evolutionary origin of behavioral task specialization among groups of identical robots. The scenario we study involves an advanced form of division of labor, common in insect societies and known as ""task partitioning"", whereby two sets of tasks have to be carried out in sequence by different individuals. Our results show that task partitioning is favored whenever the environment has features that, when exploited, reduce switching costs and increase the net efficiency of the group, and that an optimal mix of task specialists is achieved most readily when the behavioral repertoires aimed at carrying out the different subtasks are available as pre-adapted building blocks. Nevertheless, we also show for the first time that self-organized task specialization could be evolved entirely from scratch, starting only from basic, low-level behavioral primitives, using a nature-inspired evolutionary method known as Grammatical Evolution. Remarkably, division of labor was achieved merely by selecting on overall group performance, and without providing any prior information on how the global object retrieval task was best divided into smaller subtasks. We discuss the potential of our method for engineering adaptively behaving robot swarms and interpret our results in relation to the likely path that nature took to evolve complex sociality and task specialization.","[Ferrante, Eliseo; Duenez-Guzman, Edgar; Wenseleers, Tom] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Inst Zool, Lab Socio Ecol & Social Evolut, Leuven, Belgium; [Turgut, Ali Emre] Middle E Tech Univ, Dept Mech Engn, TR-06531 Ankara, Turkey; [Dorigo, Marco] Univ Libre Bruxelles, IRIDIA CoDE, Brussels, Belgium","Ferrante, E (reprint author), Katholieke Univ Leuven, Inst Zool, Lab Socio Ecol & Social Evolut, Leuven, Belgium.",eliseo.ferrante@bio.kuleuven.be,"Ferrante, Eliseo/S-7877-2017; Wenseleers, Tom/J-3960-2013","Ferrante, Eliseo/0000-0002-2213-8356; Wenseleers, Tom/0000-0002-1434-861X",KU Leuven [F+/11/033]; European Research Council [246939]; Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey [TUBITAK-2219]; KU Leuven Excellence Center project [PF/2010/007],"EF, AET and TW acknowledge the European Science Foundation ""H2Swarm"" program (http://www.esf.org/) and the KU Leuven (www.kuleuven.be) for the IDO-BioCo3 project and KU Leuven Excellence Center project PF/2010/007.

Here we test the hypothesis that the integration process itself can be tuned to the statistical structure of the environment. We exposed human participants to a reaching task in a three-dimensional virtual reality environment where we could displace the visual feedback of their hand position in a two dimensional plane. When introducing statistical structure between the two dimensions of the displacement, we found that over the course of several days participants adapted their feedback integration process in order to exploit this structure for performance improvement. In control experiments we found that this adaptation process critically depended on performance feedback and could not be induced by verbal instructions.

While for some steps of this process the effect on protein production is understood, a holistic understanding of translation still remains elusive. In silico modelling is a promising approach for elucidating the process of protein synthesis. Although a number of computational models of the process have been proposed, their application is limited by the assumptions they make. Ribosome profiling (RP), a relatively new sequencing-based technique capable of recording snapshots of the locations of actively translating ribosomes, is a promising source of information for deriving unbiased data-driven translation models. However, quantitative analysis of RP data is challenging due to high measurement variance and the inability to discriminate between the number of ribosomes measured on a gene and their speed of translation. We propose a solution in the form of a novel multi-scale interpretation of RP data that allows for deriving models with translation dynamics extracted from the snapshots. We demonstrate the usefulness of this approach by simultaneously determining for the first time per-codon translation elongation and per-gene translation initiation rates of Saccharomyces cerevisiae from RP data for two versions of the Totally Asymmetric Exclusion Process (TASEP) model of translation. We do this in an unbiased fashion, by fitting the models using only RP data with a novel optimization scheme based on Monte Carlo simulation to keep the problem tractable. The fitted models match the data significantly better than existing models and their predictions show better agreement with several independent protein abundance data-sets than existing models. Results additionally indicate that the tRNA pool adaptation hypothesis is incomplete, with evidence suggesting that tRNA post-transcriptional modifications and codon context may play a role in determining codon elongation rates.","[Gritsenko, Alexey A.; Hulsman, Marc; Reinders, Marcel J.

Significant variability in cellular properties are also seen within a nominal neuronal class and this heterogeneity can be expected to influence the population response and information processing in networks. Recent studies have examined the population and network effects of variability in a particular neuronal parameter with some plausibly chosen distribution. However, the empirical variability and covariance seen across multiple parameters are rarely included, partly due to the lack of data on parameter correlations in forms convenient for model construction. To addess this we quantify the heterogeneity within and between the neocortical pyramidal-cell classes in layers 2/3, 4, and the slender-tufted and thick-tufted pyramidal cells of layer 5 using a combination of intracellular recordings, single-neuron modelling and statistical analyses. From the response to both square-pulse and naturalistic fluctuating stimuli, we examined the class-dependent variance and covariance of electrophysiological parameters and identify the role of the h current in generating parameter correlations. A byproduct of the dynamic I-V method we employed is the straightforward extraction of reduced neuron models from experiment. Empirically these models took the refractory exponential integrate-and-fire form and provide an accurate fit to the perisomatic voltage responses of the diverse pyramidal-cell populations when the class-dependent statistics of the model parameters were respected. By quantifying the parameter statistics we obtained an algorithm which generates populations of model neurons, for each of the four pyramidal-cell classes, that adhere to experimentally observed marginal distributions and parameter correlations. As well as providing this tool, which we hope will be of use for exploring the effects of heterogeneity in neocortical networks, we also provide the code for the dynamic I-V method and make the full electrophysiological data set available.","[Harrison, Paul M.] Univ Warwick, MOAC Doctoral Training Ctr, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England; [Harrison, Paul M.; Wall, Mark J.] Univ Warwick, Sch Life Sci, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England; [Harrison, Paul M.; Richardson, Magnus J.

Here we study metabolism's potential for innovation by analyzing an exhaustive genotype-phenotype map for a space of 1015 metabolisms that encodes all possible subsets of 51 reactions in central carbon metabolism. Using flux balance analysis, we predict the viability of these metabolisms on 10 different carbon sources which give rise to 1024 potential metabolic phenotypes. Although viable metabolisms with any one phenotype comprise a tiny fraction of genotype space, their absolute numbers exceed 109 for some phenotypes. Metabolisms with any one phenotype typically form a single network of genotypes that extends far or all the way through metabolic genotype space, where any two genotypes can be reached from each other through a series of single reaction changes. The minimal distance of genotype networks associated with different phenotypes is small, such that one can reach metabolisms with novel phenotypes-viable on new carbon sources - through one or few genotypic changes. Exceptions to these principles exist for those metabolisms whose complexity (number of reactions) is close to the minimum needed for viability. Increasing metabolic complexity enhances the potential for both evolutionary conservation and evolutionary innovation.","[Hosseini, Sayed-Rzgar; Barve, Aditya; Wagner, Andreas] Univ Zurich, Inst Evolutionary Biol & Environm Sci, Zurich, Switzerland; [Hosseini, Sayed-Rzgar; Barve, Aditya; Wagner, Andreas] Swiss Inst Bioinformat, Lausanne, Switzerland; [Wagner, Andreas] Santa Fe Inst, Santa Fe, NM 87501 USA","Hosseini, SR (reprint author), Univ Zurich, Inst Evolutionary Biol & Environm Sci, Zurich, Switzerland.",andreas.wagner@ieu.uzh.ch,,"Hosseini, Sayed-Rzgar/0000-0002-2308-6754",Swiss National Science Foundation [31003A_146137]; University Priority Research Program in Evolutionary Biology at the University of Zurich,"AW received Swiss National Science Foundation grant 31003A_146137, and also received funding from University Priority Research Program in Evolutionary Biology at the University of Zurich.

Here, we present a detailed characterization of Escherichia coli growth and starvation over a time-course lasting two weeks. We have measured multiple cellular components, including RNA and proteins at deep genomic coverage, as well as lipid modifications and flux through central metabolism. Our study focuses on the physiological response of E. coli in stationary phase as a result of being starved for glucose, not on the genetic adaptation of E. coli to utilize alternative nutrients. In our analysis, we have taken advantage of the temporal correlations within and among RNA and protein abundances to identify systematic trends in gene regulation. Specifically, we have developed a general computational strategy for classifying expression-profile time courses into distinct categories in an unbiased manner. We have also developed, from dynamic models of gene expression, a framework to characterize protein degradation patterns based on the observed temporal relationships between mRNA and protein abundances. By comparing and contrasting our transcriptomic and proteomic data, we have identified several broad physiological trends in the E. coli starvation response. Strikingly, mRNAs are widely down-regulated in response to glucose starvation, presumably as a strategy for reducing new protein synthesis. By contrast, protein abundances display more varied responses. The abundances of many proteins involved in energy-intensive processes mirror the corresponding mRNA profiles while proteins involved in nutrient metabolism remain abundant even though their corresponding mRNAs are down-regulated.","[Houser, John R.; Barnhart, Craig; Boutz, Daniel R.; Dasgupta, Aurko; Needham, Brittany D.; Papoulas, Ophelia; Sydykova, Dariya K.; Trent, M.

However, our knowledge of X. laevis protein post-translational modifications remains scarce. Here, we used a mass spectrometry-based approach to survey the phosphoproteome of this species, compiling a list of 2636 phosphosites. We used structural information and phosphoproteomic data for 13 other species in order to predict functionally important phospho-regulatory events. We found that the degree of conservation of phosphosites across species is predictive of sites with known molecular function. In addition, we predicted kinase-protein interactions for a set of cell-cycle kinases across all species. The degree of conservation of kinase-protein interactions was found to be predictive of functionally relevant regulatory interactions. Finally, using comparative protein structure models, we find that phosphosites within structured domains tend to be located at positions with high conformational flexibility. Our analysis suggests that a small class of phosphosites occurs in positions that have the potential to regulate protein conformation.","[Johnson, Jeffrey R.; Johnson, Tasha; Krogan, Nevan J.] Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Cellular & Mol Pharmacol, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; [Santos, Silvia D.] Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Quantitat Cell Biol Grp, MRC, Ctr Clin Sci, London, England; [Pieper, Ursula; Sali, Andrej] Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Bioengn & Therapeut Sci, Calif Inst Quantitat Biosci, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; [Pieper, Ursula; Sali, Andrej] Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Pharmaceut Chem, Calif Inst Quantitat Biosci, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; [Strumillo, Marta; Wagih, Omar; Beltrao, Pedro] European Mol Biol Lab, Genome Biol Unit, D-69012 Heidelberg, Germany; [Strumillo, Marta; Wagih, Omar; Beltrao, Pedro] European Bioinformat Inst EMBL EBI, Cambridge, England; [Krogan, Nevan J.] Gladstone Inst, San Francisco, CA USA; [Beltrao, Pedro] Univ Aveiro, iBiMED, P-3800 Aveiro, Portugal; [Beltrao, Pedro] Univ Aveiro, Dept Hlth Sci, P-3800 Aveiro, Portugal","Johnson, JR (reprint author), Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Cellular & Mol Pharmacol, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA.",pbeltrao@ebi.ac.uk,,"Wagih, Omar/0000-0002-2162-0431; Strumillo, Marta/0000-0003-1527-2482; Beltrao, Pedro/0000-0002-2724-7703",MRC career development award; Human Frontier Science Program [CDA00069/2013-C]; NIH NIGMS [U54 GM074945]; Medical Research Council [MC_UP_1102/9],"SDS is supported by an MRC career development award.

Here, employing a coarse-grained molecular model that captures residue-level structural details up to histone tails, we simulated equilibrium fluctuations and forced unwrapping of single nucleosomes at various conditions. The equilibrium simulations showed spontaneous unwrapping from outer DNA and subsequent rewrapping dynamics, which are in good agreement with experiments. We found several distinct partially unwrapped states of nucleosomes, as well as reversible transitions among these states. At a low salt concentration, histone tails tend to sit in the concave cleft between the histone octamer and DNA, tightening the nucleosome. At a higher salt concentration, the tails tend to bound to the outer side of DNA or be expanded outwards, which led to higher degree of unwrapping. Of the four types of histone tails, H3 and H2B tail dynamics are markedly correlated with partial unwrapping of DNA, and, moreover, their contributions were distinct. Acetylation in histone tails was simply mimicked by changing their charges, which enhanced the unwrapping, especially markedly for H3 and H2B tails.","[Kenzaki, Hiroo; Takada, Shoji] RIKEN, Adv Ctr Comp & Commun, Wako, Saitama, Japan; [Kenzaki, Hiroo; Takada, Shoji] Kyoto Univ, Grad Sch Sci, Dept Biophys, Kyoto, Japan","Kenzaki, H (reprint author), RIKEN, Adv Ctr Comp & Commun, Wako, Saitama, Japan.",takada@biophys.kyoto-u.ac.jp,,,"Japan Society of Promotion of Science (JSPS); Ministry of Education Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology (MEXT); Strategic Programs for Innovative Research ""Supercomputational Life Science"" of MEXT","This work was partly supported by Grant-in-Aid for Research (A) of the Japan Society of Promotion of Science (JSPS), partly by the Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research on Innovative Area of the Ministry of Education Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology (MEXT), and partly by the Strategic Programs for Innovative Research ""Supercomputational Life Science"" of MEXT.

Escher provides pathway suggestions based on user data and genome-scale models, so users can draw pathways in a semi-automated way. Second, users can visualize data related to genes or proteins on the associated reactions and pathways, using rules that define which enzymes catalyze each reaction. Thus, users can identify trends in common genomic data types (e.g. RNA-Seq, proteomics, ChIP)-in conjunction with metabolite-and reaction-oriented data types (e.g. metabolomics, fluxomics). Third, Escher harnesses the strengths of web technologies (SVG, D3, developer tools) so that visualizations can be rapidly adapted, extended, shared, and embedded. This paper provides examples of each of these features and explains how the development approach used for Escher can be used to guide the development of future visualization tools.","[King, Zachary A.; Draeger, Andreas; Ebrahim, Ali; Palsson, Bernhard O.] Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Bioengn, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Draeger, Andreas] Univ Tubingen, Ctr Bioinformat Tuebingen ZBIT, Tubingen, Germany; [Sonnenschein, Nikolaus] Tech Univ Denmark, Novo Nordisk Fdn Ctr Biosustainabil, DK-2800 Lyngby, Denmark; [Lewis, Nathan E.; Palsson, Bernhard O.] Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Pediat, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA","King, ZA (reprint author), Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Bioengn, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA.",palsson@ucsd.edu,"Drager, Andreas/F-5620-2015; Sonnenschein, Nikolaus/F-6853-2012; King, Zachary/V-3402-2019","Drager, Andreas/0000-0002-1240-5553; Sonnenschein, Nikolaus/0000-0002-7581-4936; King, Zachary/0000-0003-1238-1499; Lewis, Nathan/0000-0001-7700-3654; Ebrahim, Ali/0000-0002-4009-2128","National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship [DGE-1144086]; European Commission as part of a Marie Curie International Outgoing Fellowship within the EU 7th Framework Program for Research and Technological Development (EU project AMBiCon) [332020]; Novo Nordisk Foundation; Novo Nordisk Foundation [NNF 132150-002]; National Institutes of Health [R21 HD080682]; Department of Energy [DE-SC0008701]; NNF Center for Biosustainability [Network Reconstruction in Silico Biology, iLoop]; Novo Nordisk Fonden [NNF10CC1016517]","Funding for this work was provided by: ZK: The National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship (https://www.nsfgrfp.org/) under Grant no.

For full activation and DNA binding, the homodimeric protein requires the binding of two cyclic AMP (cAMP) molecules in an anti-cooperative manner, the source of which appears to be largely of entropic nature according to previous experimental studies. We here study at atomic detail the allosteric regulation of CAP with Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. We recover the experimentally observed entropic penalty for the second cAMP binding event with our recently developed force covariance entropy estimator and reveal allosteric communication pathways with Force Distribution Analyses (FDA). Our observations show that CAP binding results in characteristic changes in the interaction pathways connecting the two cAMP allosteric binding sites with each other, as well as with the DNA binding domains. We identified crucial relays in the mostly symmetric allosteric activation network, and suggest point mutants to test this mechanism. Our study suggests inter-residue forces, as opposed to coordinates, as a highly sensitive measure for structural adaptations that, even though minute, can very effectively propagate allosteric signals.","[Louet, Maxime; Seifert, Christian; Grater, Frauke] Heidelberg Inst Theoret Studies gGmbH, Heidelberg, Germany; [Hensen, Ulf] Eidgenoss Tech Hsch Zurich, Dept Biosyst Sci & Engn, Basel, Switzerland; [Grater, Frauke] CAS MPG Partner Inst, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Grater, Frauke] Key Lab Computat Biol, Shanghai, Peoples R China","Louet, M (reprint author), Heidelberg Inst Theoret Studies gGmbH, Heidelberg, Germany.",frauke.graeter@h-its.org,"Grater, Frauke/D-3450-2009","Grater, Frauke/0000-0003-2891-3381","Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, Graduate School 850, University of Heidelberg, Germany [Sachbeihilfe GR-3494/2]; ""Klaus Tschira Foundation"", Heidelberg, Germany","This study has been funded by the ""Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft"", Graduate School 850, University of Heidelberg, Germany, http://www.dfg.de - Sachbeihilfe GR-3494/2 and the ""Klaus Tschira Foundation"", Heidelberg, Germany, http://www.klaus-tschira-stiftung.de/.

It is well known that somatic genome alterations (SGAs) affecting the genes that encode the proteins within a common signaling pathway exhibit mutual exclusivity, in which these SGAs usually do not co-occur in a tumor. With some success, this characteristic has been utilized as an objective function to guide the search for driver mutations within a pathway. However, mutual exclusivity alone is not sufficient to indicate that genes affected by such SGAs are in common pathways. Here, we propose a novel, signal-oriented framework for identifying driver SGAs. First, we identify the perturbed cellular signals by mining the gene expression data. Next, we search for a set of SGA events that carries strong information with respect to such perturbed signals while exhibiting mutual exclusivity. Finally, we design and implement an efficient exact algorithm to solve an NP-hard problem encountered in our approach. We apply this framework to the ovarian and glioblastoma tumor data available at the TCGA database, and perform systematic evaluations. Our results indicate that the signal-oriented approach enhances the ability to find informative sets of driver SGAs that likely constitute signaling pathways.","[Lu, Songjian; Lu, Kevin N.; Ma, Xiaojun; Lu, Xinghua] Univ Pittsburgh, Dept Biomed Informat, Pittsburgh, PA 15260 USA; [Cheng, Shi-Yuan; Hu, Bo] Northeastern Univ, Northwestern Brain Tumor Inst, Dept Neurol, Ctr Genet Med,Feinberg Sch Med, Chicago, IL USA; [Nystrom, Nicholas] Pittsburgh Supercomp Ctr, Pittsburgh, PA USA","Lu, SJ (reprint author), Univ Pittsburgh, Dept Biomed Informat, Pittsburgh, PA 15260 USA.",songjian@pitt.edu,,,"NIH-NLM [K99LM011673, R01LM010144, R01LM011155, U54HG008540, CA158911]; NSF [OCI-1053575]; Zell Scholar Award from Zell Family Foundation; Northwestern Brain Tumor Institute; Brain Cancer Research Award from James S.

A common assumption in evolutionary game theory is that interactions are symmetric, which means that the players are distinguished by only their strategies. In nature, however, the microscopic interactions between players are nearly always asymmetric due to environmental effects, differing baseline characteristics, and other possible sources of heterogeneity. To model these phenomena, we introduce into evolutionary game theory two broad classes of asymmetric interactions: ecological and genotypic. Ecological asymmetry results from variation in the environments of the players, while genotypic asymmetry is a consequence of the players having differing baseline genotypes. We develop a theory of these forms of asymmetry for games in structured populations and use the classical social dilemmas, the Prisoner's Dilemma and the Snowdrift Game, for illustrations. Interestingly, asymmetric games reveal essential differences between models of genetic evolution based on reproduction and models of cultural evolution based on imitation that are not apparent in symmetric games.","[McAvoy, Alex; Hauert, Christoph] Univ British Columbia, Dept Math, Vancouver, BC, Canada","McAvoy, A (reprint author), Univ British Columbia, Dept Math, Vancouver, BC, Canada.",mcavoy@math.ubc.ca,"Hauert, Christoph/E-5369-2011","Hauert, Christoph/0000-0002-1239-281X; McAvoy, Alex/0000-0002-9110-4635",Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC); Foundational Questions in Evolutionary Biology Fund (FQEB) [RFP-12-10],"AM and CH acknowledge financial support from the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC) (http://www.nserc-crsng.gc.ca/index_eng.asp) and CH from the Foundational Questions in Evolutionary Biology Fund (FQEB), grant RFP-12-10 (http://www.templeton.org/what-we-fund/grants/foundational-questions-in-evolutionary-biology-fqeb).

Recent work focuses on principles that constrain how vessel size changes through branching generations from the aorta to capillaries and uses scaling exponents to quantify these changes. Prominent scaling theories predict that combinations of these exponents explain how metabolic, growth, and other biological rates vary with body size. Nevertheless, direct measurements of individual vessel segments have been limited because existing techniques for measuring vasculature are invasive, time consuming, and technically difficult. We developed software that extracts the length, radius, and connectivity of in vivo vessels from contrast-enhanced 3D Magnetic Resonance Angiography. Using data from 20 human subjects, we calculated scaling exponents by four methods-two derived from local properties of branching junctions and two from whole-network properties. Although these methods are often used interchangeably in the literature, we do not find general agreement between these methods, particularly for vessel lengths. Measurements for length of vessels also diverge from theoretical values, but those for radius show stronger agreement. Our results demonstrate that vascular network models cannot ignore certain complexities of real vascular systems and indicate the need to discover new principles regarding vessel lengths.","[Newberry, Mitchell G.; Savage, Van M.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, David Geffen Sch Med, Dept Biomath, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Ennis, Daniel B.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Radiol Sci Biomed Phys & Bioengn, Los Angeles, CA USA; [Savage, Van M.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Los Angeles, CA USA; [Savage, Van M.] Santa Fe Inst, Santa Fe, NM 87501 USA","Newberry, MG (reprint author), Univ Penn, Dept Biol, 433 S Univ Ave, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.",vsavage@ucla.edu,,,US National Science Foundation [1254159],"VMS received funding from the US National Science Foundation (ID: 1254159, http://nsf.gov/).

This structure is shaped, in part, by synaptic plasticity that promotes or suppresses connections between neurons depending on their joint spiking activity. Frequently, theoretical studies focus on how feedforward inputs drive plasticity to create this network structure. We study the complementary scenario of self-organized structure in a recurrent network, with spike timing-dependent plasticity driven by spontaneous dynamics. We develop a self-consistent theory for the evolution of network structure by combining fast spiking covariance with a slow evolution of synaptic weights. Through a finite-size expansion of network dynamics we obtain a low-dimensional set of nonlinear differential equations for the evolution of two-synapse connectivity motifs. With this theory in hand, we explore how the form of the plasticity rule drives the evolution of microcircuits in cortical networks. When potentiation and depression are in approximate balance, synaptic dynamics depend on weighted divergent, convergent, and chain motifs. For additive, Hebbian STDP these motif interactions create instabilities in synaptic dynamics that either promote or suppress the initial network structure.

While mapping genomes in 3D has for a long time been elusive, recent adaptations of high-throughput sequencing to chromosome conformation capture (3C) techniques, allows for genome-wide structural characterization for the first time. However, reconstruction of ""consensus"" 3D genomes from 3C-based data is a challenging problem, since the data are aggregated over millions of cells. Recent single-cell adaptations to the 3C-technique, however, allow for non-aggregated structural assessment of genome structure, but data suffer from sparse and noisy interaction sampling. We present a manifold based optimization (MBO) approach for the reconstruction of 3D genome structure from chromosomal contact data. We show that MBO is able to reconstruct 3D structures based on the chromosomal contacts, imposing fewer structural violations than comparable methods. Additionally, MBO is suitable for efficient high-throughput reconstruction of large systems, such as entire genomes, allowing for comparative studies of genomic structure across cell-lines and different species.","[Paulsen, Jonas] Univ Oslo, Inst Basic Med Sci, Fac Med, Dept Mol Med, N-0317 Oslo, Norway; Univ Oslo, Norwegian Ctr Stem Cell Res, N-0317 Oslo, Norway","Paulsen, J (reprint author), Univ Oslo, Inst Basic Med Sci, Fac Med, Dept Mol Med, N-0317 Oslo, Norway.",jonaspau@medisin.uio.no,,,Research Council of Norway; Molecular Life Science Program of the University of Oslo,"This work was supported by the Research Council of Norway (JP) and the Molecular Life Science Program of the University of Oslo (OG).

One of the most robust hallmarks of task/stimulus-driven brain dynamics is the decrease of variability with respect to the spontaneous level, an effect seen across multiple experimental conditions and in brain signals observed at different spatiotemporal scales. Recently, it was observed that the trial-to-trial variability and temporal variance of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) signals decrease in the task-driven activity. Here we examined the dynamics of a large-scale model of the human cortex to provide a mechanistic understanding of these observations. The model allows computing the statistics of synaptic activity in the spontaneous condition and in putative tasks determined by external inputs to a given subset of brain regions. We demonstrated that external inputs decrease the variance, increase the covariances, and decrease the autocovariance of synaptic activity as a consequence of single node and large-scale network dynamics. Altogether, these changes in network statistics imply a reduction of entropy, meaning that the spontaneous synaptic activity outlines a larger multidimensional activity space than does the task-driven activity. We tested this model's prediction on fMRI signals from healthy humans acquired during rest and task conditions and found a significant decrease of entropy in the stimulus-driven activity. Altogether, our study proposes a mechanism for increasing the information capacity of brain networks by enlarging the volume of possible activity configurations at rest and reliably settling into a confined stimulus-driven state to allow better transmission of stimulus-related information.","[Ponce-Alvarez, Adrian; Deco, Gustavo] Univ Pompeu Fabra, Dept Informat & Commun Technol, Computat Neurosci Grp, Ctr Brain & Cognit, Barcelona, Spain; [He, Biyu J.] NINDS, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; [Hagmann, Patric] Univ Lausanne Hosp, Dept Radiol, Lausanne, Switzerland; [Hagmann, Patric] Univ Lausanne CHUV UNIL, Lausanne, Switzerland; [Hagmann, Patric] Ecole Polytech Fed Lausanne, Signal Proc Lab 5, Lausanne, Switzerland; [Deco, Gustavo] Univ Pompeu Fabra, Inst Catalana Recerca & Estudis Avancats, Barcelona, Spain","Ponce-Alvarez, A (reprint author), Univ Pompeu Fabra, Dept Informat & Commun Technol, Computat Neurosci Grp, Ctr Brain & Cognit, Barcelona, Spain.",adrian.ponce@upf.edu,"Ponce-Alvarez, Adrian/A-5698-2018; DECO, GUSTAVO/A-6341-2008","Ponce-Alvarez, Adrian/0000-0003-1446-7392; DECO, GUSTAVO/0000-0002-8995-7583; He, Biyu/0000-0003-1549-1351","SEMAINE ERA-Net NEURON Project; ERC Advanced Grant: DYSTRUCTURE [295129]; FP7-ICT BrainScales; Leenaards Foundation; Intramural Research Program of the National Institutes of Health, National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke; ICREA","APA was supported by SEMAINE ERA-Net NEURON Project.

Amongst the cellular effects induced by cholinergic modulation are a reduction in spike-frequency adaptation (SFA) and a shift in the phase response curve (PRC). We demonstrate in a biophysical model how changes in neural excitability and network structure interact to create three distinct functional regimes: localized asynchronous, traveling asynchronous, and traveling synchronous. Our results qualitatively match those observed experimentally. Cortical activity during slow wave sleep (SWS) differs from that during REM sleep or waking states. During SWS there are traveling patterns of activity in the cortex; in other states stationary patterns occur. Our model is a network composed of Hodgkin-Huxley type neurons with a M-current regulated by ACh. Regulation of ACh level can account for dynamical changes between functional regimes. Reduction of the magnitude of this current recreates the reduction in SFA the shift from a type 2 to a type 1 PRC observed in the presence of ACh. When SFA is minimal (in waking or REM sleep state, high ACh) patterns of activity are localized and easily pinned by network inhomogeneities. When SFA is present (decreasing ACh), traveling waves of activity naturally arise. A further decrease in ACh leads to a high degree of synchrony within traveling waves. We also show that the level of ACh determines how sensitive network activity is to synaptic heterogeneity. These regimes may have a profound functional significance as stationary patterns may play a role in the proper encoding of external input as memory and traveling waves could lead to synaptic regularization, giving unique insights into the role and significance of ACh in determining patterns of cortical activity and functional differences arising from the patterns.","[Roach, James P.; Zochowski, Michal R.] Univ Michigan, Grad Program Neurosci, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Ben-Jacob, Eshel] Tel Aviv Univ, Sch Phys & Astron, IL-69978 Tel Aviv, Israel; [Ben-Jacob, Eshel] Rice Univ, Ctr Theoret Biol Phys, Houston, TX USA; [Ben-Jacob, Eshel] Rice Univ, Dept Biochem & Cell Biol, Houston, TX 77251 USA; [Sander, Leonard M.; Zochowski, Michal R.] Univ Michigan, Dept Phys, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Sander, Leonard M.; Zochowski, Michal R.] Univ Michigan, Ctr Studies Complex Syst, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Zochowski, Michal R.] Univ Michigan, Biophys Program, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA","Roach, JP (reprint author), Univ Michigan, Grad Program Neurosci, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",roachjp@umich.edu,,"Roach, James P./0000-0002-1034-9615","NSF Graduate Research Fellowship Program [DGE 1256260]; Rackham Merit Fellowship, University of Michigan; Tauber Family Funds; Maguy-Glass Chair in Physics of Complex Systems at Tel Aviv University; NSF Center for Theoretical Biological Physics [PHY-1427654, NSF-MCB-1214457]; NSF [PoLS 1058034, CMMI 1029388]","This work was supported by: NSF Graduate Research Fellowship Program under Grant No. DGE 1256260 (JPR) www.nsf.gov; Rackham Merit Fellowship, University of Michigan www.umich.edu; Tauber Family Funds and the Maguy-Glass Chair in Physics of Complex Systems at Tel Aviv University (EBJ), www.tau.ac.il; NSF Center for Theoretical Biological Physics Grants PHY-1427654 and NSF-MCB-1214457 (EBJ) www.nsf.gov; NSF CMMI 1029388 (MRZ) www.nsf.gov; and NSF PoLS 1058034 (MRZ & LMS) www.nsf.gov.

Unexpectedly, these experiments often find that proteins are tolerant to most amino acid substitutions, including substitutions in positions that are highly conserved in nature. To obtain a more realistic distribution of the effects of protein mutations, we applied a laboratory drift comprising 17 rounds of random mutagenesis and selection of M.HaeIII, a DNA methyltransferase. During this drift, multiple mutations gradually accumulated. Deep sequencing of the drifted gene ensembles allowed determination of the relative effects of all possible single nucleotide mutations. Despite being averaged across many different genetic backgrounds, about 67% of all nonsynonymous, missense mutations were evidently deleterious, and an additional 16% were likely to be deleterious. In the early generations, the frequency of most deleterious mutations remained high. However, by the 17th generation, their frequency was consistently reduced, and those remaining were accepted alongside compensatory mutations. The tolerance to mutations measured in this laboratory drift correlated with sequence exchanges seen in M. HaeIII's natural orthologs. The biophysical constraints dictating purging in nature and in this laboratory drift also seemed to overlap. Our experiment therefore provides an improved method for measuring the effects of protein mutations that more closely replicates the natural evolutionary forces, and thereby a more realistic view of the mutational space of proteins.","[Rockah-Shmuel, Liat; Toth-Petroczy, Agnes; Tawfik, Dan S.] Weizmann Inst Sci, Dept Biol Chem, IL-76100 Rehovot, Israel","Rockah-Shmuel, L (reprint author), Weizmann Inst Sci, Dept Biol Chem, IL-76100 Rehovot, Israel.",tawfik@weizmann.ac.il,,,Israel Science Foundation [606/10]; DTRA [HDTRA1-11-C-0026],"Financial support by the Israel Science Foundation (606/10) and DTRA (HDTRA1-11-C-0026) are gratefully acknowledged.

Therefore, a mathematical description of sprouting angiogenesis has to take into consideration biological signals as well as relevant physical processes, in particular the mechanical interplay between adjacent endothelial cells and the extracellular micro-environment. In this work, we introduce the first phase-field continuous model of sprouting angiogenesis capable of predicting sprout morphology as a function of the elastic properties of the tissues and the traction forces exerted by the cells. The model is very compact, only consisting of three coupled partial differential equations, and has the clear advantage of a reduced number of parameters. This model allows us to describe sprout growth as a function of the cell-cell adhesion forces and the traction force exerted by the sprout tip cell. In the absence of proliferation, we observe that the sprout either achieves a maximum length or, when the traction and adhesion are very large, it breaks. Endothelial cell proliferation alters significantly sprout morphology, and we explore how different types of endothelial cell proliferation regulation are able to determine the shape of the growing sprout. The largest region in parameter space with well formed long and straight sprouts is obtained always when the proliferation is triggered by endothelial cell strain and its rate grows with angiogenic factor concentration. We conclude that in this scenario the tip cell has the role of creating a tension in the cells that follow its lead. On those first stalk cells, this tension produces strain and/or empty spaces, inevitably triggering cell proliferation. The new cells occupy the space behind the tip, the tension decreases, and the process restarts. Our results highlight the ability of mathematical models to suggest relevant hypotheses with respect to the role of forces in sprouting, hence underlining the necessary collaboration between modelling and molecular biology techniques to improve the current state-of-the-art.","[Santos-Oliveira, Patricia; Travasso, Rui D.

Due to the central functional significance of this local connectivity in the placement of beta cells in an islet, it is important to characterize it quantitatively. However, quantification of the seemingly stochastic cytoarchitecture of beta cells in an islet requires mathematical methods that can capture topological connectivity in the entire beta-cell population in an islet. Graph theory provides such a framework. Using large-scale imaging data for thousands of islets containing hundreds of thousands of cells in human organ donor pancreata, we show that quantitative graph characteristics differ between control and type 2 diabetic islets. Further insight into the processes that shape and maintain this architecture is obtained by formulating a stochastic theory of beta-cell rearrangement in whole islets, just as the normal equilibrium distribution of the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process can be viewed as the result of the interplay between a random walk and a linear restoring force. Requiring that rearrangements maintain the observed quantitative topological graph characteristics strongly constrained possible processes. Our results suggest that beta-cell rearrangement is dependent on its connectivity in order to maintain an optimal cluster size in both normal and T2D islets.","[Striegel, Deborah A.; Periwal, Vipul] NIDDK, Lab Biol Modeling, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; [Hara, Manami] Univ Chicago, Dept Med, Chicago, IL 60637 USA","Striegel, DA (reprint author), NIDDK, Lab Biol Modeling, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA.",vipulp@mail.nih.gov,,,"Intramural Research Program of the National Institutes of Health, NIDDK","This work was supported by Intramural Research Program of the National Institutes of Health, NIDDK.

Although SM, CS, and DS have been used to predict TF binding sites, a predictive model that jointly considers CS and DS has not been developed to predict either TF-specific binding or general binding properties of TFs. Using budding yeast as model, we found that machine learning classifiers trained with either CS or DS features alone perform better in predicting TF-specific binding compared to SM-based classifiers. In addition, simultaneously considering CS and DS further improves the accuracy of the TF binding predictions, indicating the highly complementary nature of these two properties. The contributions of SM, CS, and DS features to binding site predictions differ greatly between TFs, allowing TF-specific predictions and potentially reflecting different TF binding mechanisms. In addition, a ""TF-agnostic"" predictive model based on three DNA ""intrinsic properties"" (in silico predicted nucleosome occupancy, major groove geometry, and dinucleotide free energy) that can be calculated from genomic sequences alone has performance that rivals the model incorporating experiment-derived data. This intrinsic property model allows prediction of binding regions not only across TFs, but also across DNA-binding domain families with distinct structural folds. Furthermore, these predicted binding regions can help identify TF binding sites that have a significant impact on target gene expression. Because the intrinsic property model allows prediction of binding regions across DNA-binding domain families, it is TF agnostic and likely describes general binding potential of TFs. Thus, our findings suggest that it is feasible to establish a TF agnostic model for identifying functional regulatory regions in potentially any sequenced genome.","[Tsai, Zing Tsung-Yeh; Tsai, Huai-Kuang] Acad Sinica, Inst Informat Sci, Taipei, Taiwan; [Tsai, Zing Tsung-Yeh; Shiu, Shin-Han] Michigan State Univ, Dept Plant Biol, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA","Tsai, ZTY (reprint author), Acad Sinica, Inst Informat Sci, Taipei, Taiwan.",shius@msu.edu; hktsai@iis.sinica.edu.tw,"Shiu, Shin-Han/R-6117-2016","Shiu, Shin-Han/0000-0001-6470-235X; Tsai, Zing Tsung-Yeh/0000-0002-4006-1559","Taiwan Ministry of Science and Technology [MOST104-2917-I-564-070, MOST103-2221-E-001-024-MY2]; US National Science Foundation [MCB-1119778]","This work was partly supported by the Taiwan Ministry of Science and Technology (http:// www.most.gov.tw) [MOST104-2917-I-564-070 to ZTYT and MOST103-2221-E-001-024-MY2 to HKT] and the US National Science Foundation (http://www.nsf.gov) [MCB-1119778 to SHS].

While the current structural coverage of proteins is almost exclusively provided by template-based techniques, the modeling of the rest of the protein sequences increasingly require template-free methods. However, template-free modeling methods are much less reliable and are usually applicable for smaller proteins, leaving much space for improvement. We present here a novel computational method that uses a library of supersecondary structure fragments, known as Smotifs, to model protein structures. The library of Smotifs has saturated over time, providing a theoretical foundation for efficient modeling. The method relies on weak sequence signals from remotely related protein structures to create a library of Smotif fragments specific to the target protein sequence. This Smotif library is exploited in a fragment assembly protocol to sample decoys, which are assessed by a composite scoring function. Since the Smotif fragments are larger in size compared to the ones used in other fragment-based methods, the proposed modeling algorithm, SmotifTF, can employ an exhaustive sampling during decoy assembly. SmotifTF successfully predicts the overall fold of the target proteins in about 50% of the test cases and performs competitively when compared to other state of the art prediction methods, especially when sequence signal to remote homologs is diminishing. Smotif-based modeling is complementary to current prediction methods and provides a promising direction in addressing the structure prediction problem, especially when targeting larger proteins for modeling.","[Vallat, Brinda; Madrid-Aliste, Carlos; Fiser, Andras] Albert Einstein Coll Med, Dept Syst & Computat Biol, Bronx, NY 10467 USA","Vallat, B (reprint author), Albert Einstein Coll Med, Dept Syst & Computat Biol, Bronx, NY 10467 USA.",andras.fiser@einstein.yu.edu,,,"National Institute of Health [GM094665, GM096041]","This work was supported by National Institute of Health [grants numbers GM094665 to AF; GM096041 to AF]; The funders had no role in study design, data collection and analysis, decision to publish, or preparation of the manuscript.",,59,6,6,0,7,PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE,SAN FRANCISCO,"1160 BATTERY STREET, STE 100, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94111 USA",1553-734X,1553-7358,,PLOS COMPUT BIOL,PLoS Comput.

The obtained oscillatory patterns provide vital functions as timekeepers, pacemakers and spacemarkers. Models based on control theory have been introduced to explain how specific oscillatory behaviors stem from protein interaction feedbacks, whereas the energy dissipation through the oscillating processes and its role in the regulatory function remain unexplored. Here we developed a general framework to assess an oscillator's regulation performance at different dissipation levels. Using the Escherichia coli MinCDE oscillator as a model system, we showed that a sufficient amount of energy dissipation is needed to switch on the oscillation, which is tightly coupled to the system's regulatory performance. Once the dissipation level is beyond this threshold, unlike stationary regulators' monotonic performance-to-cost relation, excess dissipation at certain steps in the oscillating process damages the oscillator's regulatory performance. We further discovered that the chemical free energy from ATP hydrolysis has to be strategically assigned to the MinE-aided MinD release and the MinD immobilization steps for optimal performance, and a higher energy budget improves the robustness of the oscillator. These results unfold a novel mode by which living systems trade energy for regulatory function.","[Xiong, Liping; Lan, Ganhui] George Washington Univ, Dept Phys, Washington, DC 20052 USA","Xiong, LP (reprint author), George Washington Univ, Dept Phys, Washington, DC 20052 USA.",glan@gwu.edu,,,Columbian College Facilitating Fund from the George Washington University; Outreach Pilot Award from Johns Hopkins University [2001907751],"LX and GL are partially supported by the Columbian College Facilitating Fund from the George Washington University and the Outreach Pilot Award from Johns Hopkins University (2001907751 to GL).

Under normal conditions two axonal cytoskeletal polymers, microtubules and neurofilaments, align longitudinally in axons and are interspersed in axonal cross-sections. However, in many neurotoxic and neurodegenerative disorders, microtubules and neurofilaments segregate apart from each other, with microtubules and membranous organelles clustered centrally and neurofilaments displaced to the periphery. This striking segregation precedes the abnormal and excessive neurofilament accumulation in these diseases, which in turn leads to focal axonal swellings. While neurofilament accumulation suggests an impairment of neurofilament transport along axons, the underlying mechanism of their segregation from microtubules remains poorly understood for over 30 years. To address this question, we developed a stochastic multiscale model for the cross-sectional distribution of microtubules and neurofilaments in axons. The model describes microtubules, neurofilaments and organelles as interacting particles in a 2D cross-section, and is built upon molecular processes that occur on a time scale of seconds or shorter. It incorporates the longitudinal transport of neurofilaments and organelles through this domain by allowing stochastic arrival and departure of these cargoes, and integrates the dynamic interactions of these cargoes with microtubules mediated by molecular motors. Simulations of the model demonstrate that organelles can pull nearby microtubules together, and in the absence of neurofilament transport, this mechanism gradually segregates microtubules from neurofilaments on a time scale of hours, similar to that observed in toxic neuropathies. This suggests that the microtubule-neurofilament segregation can be a consequence of the selective impairment of neurofilament transport. The model generates the experimentally testable prediction that the rate and extent of segregation will be dependent on the sizes of the moving organelles as well as the density of their","[Xue, Chuan] Ohio State Univ, Dept Math, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [Shtylla, Blerta] Pomona Coll, Dept Math, Claremont, CA 91711 USA; [Brown, Anthony] Ohio State Univ, Dept Neurosci, Columbus, OH 43210 USA","Xue, C (reprint author), Ohio State Univ, Dept Math, 231 W 18th Ave, Columbus, OH 43210 USA.",cxue@math.osu.edu,"Xue, Chuan/E-1571-2013","Brown, Anthony/0000-0003-2295-2929","NSF [DMS1312966, DMS 1358932]; Mathematical Biosciences Institute (MBI) at the Ohio State University; Mathematics Research Institute at the Ohio State University; MBI; NIH [R01 NS038526]","This project was supported by NSF DMS1312966 to CX.

A key goal in cell signaling studies is to identify the set of kinases that underlie key signaling events. In a typical phosphoproteomics study, phosphorylation sites (substrates) of active kinases are quantified proteome-wide. By analyzing the activities of phosphorylation sites over a time-course, the temporal dynamics of signaling cascades can be elucidated. Since many substrates of a given kinase have similar temporal kinetics, clustering phosphorylation sites into distinctive clusters can facilitate identification of their respective kinases. Here we present a knowledge-based CLUster Evaluation (CLUE) approach for identifying the most informative partitioning of a given temporal phosphoproteomics data. Our approach utilizes prior knowledge, annotated kinase-substrate relationships mined from literature and curated databases, to first generate biologically meaningful partitioning of the phosphorylation sites and then determine key kinases associated with each cluster. We demonstrate the utility of the proposed approach on two time-series phosphoproteomics datasets and identify key kinases associated with human embryonic stem cell differentiation and insulin signaling pathway.

Microbial classification based on similarity of physiological and genetic organism traits (polyphasic similarity) is experimentally difficult and, arguably, subjective. Evolutionary relatedness, inferred from phylogenetic markers, facilitates classification but does not guarantee functional identity between members of the same taxon or lack of similarity between different taxa. Using over thirteen hundred sequenced bacterial genomes, we built a novel function-based microorganism classification scheme, functional-repertoire similarity-based organism network (FuSiON; flattened to fusion). Our scheme is phenetic, based on a network of quantitatively defined organism relationships across the known prokaryotic space. It correlates significantly with the current taxonomy, but the observed discrepancies reveal both (1) the inconsistency of functional diversity levels among different taxa and (2) an (unsurprising) bias towards prioritizing, for classification purposes, relatively minor traits of particular interest to humans. Our dynamic network- based organism classification is independent of the arbitrary pairwise organism similarity cut-offs traditionally applied to establish taxonomic identity. Instead, it reveals natural, functionally defined organism groupings and is thus robust in handling organism diversity. Additionally, fusion can use organism meta-data to highlight the specific environmental factors that drive microbial diversification. Our approach provides a complementary view to cladistic assignments and holds important clues for further exploration of microbial lifestyles. Fusion is a more practical fit for biomedical, industrial, and ecological applications, as many of these rely on understanding the functional capabilities of the microbes in their environment and are less concerned with phylogenetic descent.","[Zhu, Chengsheng; Bromberg, Yana] Rutgers State Univ, Dept Biochem & Microbiol, New Brunswick, NJ 08903 USA; [Delmont, Tom O.; Vogel, Timothy M.] Univ Lyon, Ecole Cent Lyon, Lab Ampere, Environm Microbial Genom, Ecully, France; [Bromberg, Yana] Tech Univ Munich, Inst Adv Study, Garching, Germany","Zhu, CS (reprint author), Rutgers State Univ, Dept Biochem & Microbiol, New Brunswick, NJ 08903 USA.",czhu@bromberglab.org; yanab@rci.rutgers.edu,"Zhu, Chengsheng/J-7449-2019; Delmont, Tom/A-4331-2018","Delmont, Tom/0000-0001-7053-7848; Bromberg, Yana/0000-0002-8351-0844",Rutgers start-up funds; Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation [GBMF2807]; USDA-NIFA [1015:0228906]; Technische Universitat Munchen - Institute for Advanced Study Hans Fischer Fellowship - German Excellence Initiative and the European Union Seventh Framework Programme [291763]; French National Research Agency (Agence National de Recherche) project Metasoil [ANR-08-GENM-025]; Rhone-Alpes Region,"The work of CZ and YB was supported by Rutgers start-up funds (to YB); the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation (GBMF2807 to YB); the USDA-NIFA (1015:0228906 to YB); and the Technische Universitat Munchen - Institute for Advanced Study Hans Fischer Fellowship, funded by the German Excellence Initiative and the European Union Seventh Framework Programme, grant agreement 291763 (to YB).

An extensive library of radiation tracks for different particle types is created to score energy deposition in small voxels and volume segments describing a neuron's morphology that later are sampled for given particle fluence or dose. Methods included the construction of in silico mouse hippocampal granule cells from neuromorpho.org with spine and filopodia segments stochastically distributed along the dendritic branches. The model is tested with high-energy Fe-56, C-12, and H-1 particles and electrons. Results indicate that the tree-like structure of the neuronal morphology and the microscopic dose deposition of distinct particles may lead to different outcomes when cellular injury is assessed, leading to differences in structural damage for the same absorbed dose. The significance of the microscopic dose in neuron components is to introduce specific local and global modes of cellular injury that likely contribute to spine, filopodia, and dendrite pruning, impacting cognition and possibly the collapse of the neuron. Results show that the heterogeneity of heavy particle tracks at low doses, compared to the more uniform dose distribution of electrons, juxtaposed with neuron morphology make it necessary to model the spatial dose painting for specific neuronal components. Going forward, this work can directly support the development of biophysical models of the modifications of spine and dendritic morphology observed after low dose charged particle irradiation by providing accurate descriptions of the underlying physical insults to complex neuron structures at the nano-meter scale.","[Alp, Murat; Cucinotta, Francis A.] Univ Nevada, Dept Hlth Phys & Diagnost Sci, Las Vegas, NV 89154 USA; [Parihar, Vipan K.; Limoli, Charles L.] Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Radiat Oncol, Irvine, CA USA","Alp, M (reprint author), Univ Nevada, Dept Hlth Phys & Diagnost Sci, Las Vegas, NV 89154 USA.",francis.cucinotta@unlv.edu,,,,,,51,16,16,0,8,PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE,SAN FRANCISCO,"1160 BATTERY STREET, STE 100, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94111 USA",,1553-7358,,PLOS COMPUT BIOL,PLoS Comput.

We test this hypothesis using an agent-based simulation framework in which each agent is based on the biophysical model of an individual M. xanthus cell. We show that model agents, under realistic cell flexibility values, can align and form cell clusters but only when periodic reversals of cell directions are suppressed. However, by extending our model to introduce the observed ability of cells to deposit and follow slime trails, we show that effective trail-following leads to clusters in reversing cells. Furthermore, we conclude that mechanical cell alignment combined with slime-trail-following is sufficient to explain the distinct clustering behaviors observed for wild-type and non-reversing M. xanthus mutants in recent experiments. Our results are robust to variation in model parameters, match the experimentally observed trends and can be applied to understand surface motility patterns of other bacterial species.","[Balagam, Rajesh] Rice Univ, Dept Bioengn, Houston, TX 77005 USA; Rice Univ, Ctr Theoret Biol Phys, Houston, TX USA","Balagam, R (reprint author), Rice Univ, Dept Bioengn, Houston, TX 77005 USA.",igoshin@rice.edu,,,"NSF [MCB-1411780, PHY- 1427654, K2I 2014/15]","The research is supported by NSF awards MCB-1411780, PHY- 1427654 and K2I 2014/15 OG HPC workshop graduate fellowship.

Although current consensus states that the brain accumulates evidence extracted from noisy sensory information, open questions remain about how this simple model relates to other perceptual phenomena such as flexibility in decisions, decision-dependent modulation of sensory gain, or confidence about a decision. We propose a novel approach of how perceptual decisions are made by combining two influential formalisms into a new model. Specifically, we embed an attractor model of decision making into a probabilistic framework that models decision making as Bayesian inference. We show that the new model can explain decision making behaviour by fitting it to experimental data. In addition, the new model combines for the first time three important features: First, the model can update decisions in response to switches in the underlying stimulus. Second, the probabilistic formulation accounts for top-down effects that may explain recent experimental findings of decision-related gain modulation of sensory neurons. Finally, the model computes an explicit measure of confidence which we relate to recent experimental evidence for confidence computations in perceptual decision tasks.","[Bitzer, Sebastian; Bruineberg, Jelle; Kiebel, Stefan J.] Max Planck Inst Human Cognit & Brain Sci, Dept Neurol, D-04103 Leipzig, Germany; [Bitzer, Sebastian; Kiebel, Stefan J.] Tech Univ Dresden, Dept Psychol, D-01062 Dresden, Germany; [Bruineberg, Jelle] Univ Amsterdam, Inst Log Language & Computat, Dept Philosophy, NL-1012 GC Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Kiebel, Stefan J.] Univ Hosp Jena, Hans Berger Clin Neurol, Biomagnet Ctr, D-07747 Jena, Germany","Bitzer, S (reprint author), Max Planck Inst Human Cognit & Brain Sci, Dept Neurol, D-04103 Leipzig, Germany.",sebastian.bitzer@tu-dresden.de,"Kiebel, Stefan/B-1551-2009","Kiebel, Stefan/0000-0002-5052-1117; Bruineberg, Jelle/0000-0001-5675-3376",Erasmus Internship scholarship,"JB was partly funded by an Erasmus Internship scholarship.

With access to accurate and reliable forecasts of a current or upcoming influenza epidemic's behavior, policy makers can design and implement more effective countermeasures. This past year, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention hosted the ""Predict the Influenza Season Challenge"", with the task of predicting key epidemiological measures for the 2013-2014 U.S. influenza season with the help of digital surveillance data. We developed a framework for in-season forecasts of epidemics using a semiparametric Empirical Bayes framework, and applied it to predict the weekly percentage of outpatient doctors visits for influenza-like illness, and the season onset, duration, peak time, and peak height, with and without using Google Flu Trends data. Previous work on epidemic modeling has focused on developing mechanistic models of disease behavior and applying time series tools to explain historical data. However, tailoring these models to certain types of surveillance data can be challenging, and overly complex models with many parameters can compromise forecasting ability. Our approach instead produces possibilities for the epidemic curve of the season of interest using modified versions of data from previous seasons, allowing for reasonable variations in the timing, pace, and intensity of the seasonal epidemics, as well as noise in observations. Since the framework does not make strict domain-specific assumptions, it can easily be applied to some other diseases with seasonal epidemics. This method produces a complete posterior distribution over epidemic curves, rather than, for example, solely point predictions of forecasting targets. We report prospective influenza-like-illness forecasts made for the 2013-2014 U.S. influenza season, and compare the framework's cross-validated prediction error on historical data to that of a variety of simpler baseline predictors.","[Brooks, Logan C.; Farrow, David C.; Rosenfeld, Roni] Carnegie Mellon Univ, Sch Comp Sci, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA; [Hyun, Sangwon; Tibshirani, Ryan J.] Carnegie Mellon Univ, Dept Stat, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA","Brooks, LC (reprint author), Carnegie Mellon Univ, Sch Comp Sci, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA.",Roni.Rosenfeld@cs.cmu.edu,,,National Institute Of General Medical Sciences of the National Institutes of Health [U54 GM088491]; National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship Program [DGE-1252522]; NIH T32 training grant as part of the HHMI-NIBIB Interfaces Initiative [T32 EB009403]; NSF [DMS-1309174],"Research reported in this publication was supported by the National Institute Of General Medical Sciences of the National Institutes of Health under Award Number U54 GM088491.

Innate immunity provides both a very early defense to influenza virus invasion and an effective control of viral growth. Previous modelling studies of virus-innate immune response interactions have focused on infection with a single virus and, while improving our understanding of viral and immune dynamics, have been unable to effectively evaluate the relative feasibility of different hypothesised mechanisms of antiviral immunity. In recent experiments, we have applied consecutive exposures to different virus strains in a ferret model, and demonstrated that viruses differed in their ability to induce a state of temporary immunity or viral interference capable of modifying the infection kinetics of the subsequent exposure. These results imply that virus-induced early immune responses may be responsible for the observed viral hierarchy. Here we introduce and analyse a family of within-host models of re-infection viral kinetics which allow for different viruses to stimulate the innate immune response to different degrees. The proposed models differ in their hypothesised mechanisms of action of the non-specific innate immune response. We compare these alternative models in terms of their abilities to reproduce the re-exposure data. Our results show that 1) a model with viral control mediated solely by a virus-resistant state, as commonly considered in the literature, is not able to reproduce the observed viral hierarchy; 2) the synchronised and desynchronised behaviour of consecutive virus infections is highly dependent upon the interval between primary virus and challenge virus exposures and is consistent with virus-dependent stimulation of the innate immune response. Our study provides the first mechanistic explanation for the recently observed influenza viral hierarchies and demonstrates the importance of understanding the host response to multi-strain viral infections. Re-exposure experiments provide a new paradigm in which to study the immune response to influenza and its role in viral control.","[Cao, Pengxing; Yan, Ada W.

Recent efforts to computationally predict drug combination responses retain this experimental search space, as model definitions typically rely on extensive drug perturbation data. We developed a dynamical model representing a cell fate decision network in the AGS gastric cancer cell line, relying on background knowledge extracted from literature and databases. We defined a set of logical equations recapitulating AGS data observed in cells in their baseline proliferative state. Using the modeling software GINsim, model reduction and simulation compression techniques were applied to cope with the vast state space of large logical models and enable simulations of pairwise applications of specific signaling inhibitory chemical substances. Our simulations predicted synergistic growth inhibitory action of five combinations from a total of 21 possible pairs. Four of the predicted synergies were confirmed in AGS cell growth real-time assays, including known effects of combined MEK-AKT or MEK-PI3K inhibitions, along with novel synergistic effects of combined TAK1-AKT or TAK1-PI3K inhibitions. Our strategy reduces the dependence on a priori drug perturbation experimentation for well-characterized signaling networks, by demonstrating that a model predictive of combinatorial drug effects can be inferred from background knowledge on unperturbed and proliferating cancer cells. Our modeling approach can thus contribute to preclinical discovery of efficient anticancer drug combinations, and thereby to development of strategies to tailor treatment to individual cancer patients.","[Flobak, Asmund; Thommesen, Liv; Laegreid, Astrid] Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol NTNU, Dept Canc Res & Mol Med, Trondheim, Norway; [Baudot, Anais; Remy, Elisabeth] Aix Marseille Univ, CNRS, Cent Marseille, I2M,UMR 7373, Marseille, France; [Thommesen, Liv] Sor Trondelag Univ Coll, Fac Technol, Trondheim, Norway; [Thieffry, Denis] Ecole Normale Super IBENS, Inst Biol, Paris, France; [Thieffry, Denis] CNRS, UMR 8197, Paris, France; [Thieffry, Denis] INSERM, U1024, Paris, France; [Kuiper, Martin] Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol NTNU, Dept Biol, Trondheim, Norway","Flobak, A (reprint author), Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol NTNU, Dept Canc Res & Mol Med, Trondheim, Norway.",asmund.flobak@ntnu.no; astrid.lagreid@ntnu.no,"Baudot, Anais/G-9963-2011","Baudot, Anais/0000-0003-0885-7933; Thieffry, Denis/0000-0003-0271-1757",Liaison Committee; EMBO,"This work was supported by the Liaison Committee between the Central Norway Regional Health Authority (RHA) and the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU).

The link between protein kinetics and interactions that gives rise to high cooperativity is not yet fully explained from experiments or previous biophysical models. We propose a biophysical ODE-based representation of cross-bridge (XB), tropomyosin and troponin within a contractile regulatory unit (RU) to investigate the mechanisms behind cooperative activation, as well as the role of cooperativity in dynamic tension generation across different species. The model includes cooperative interactions between regulatory units (RU-RU), between crossbridges (XB-XB), as well more complex interactions between crossbridges and regulatory units (XB-RU interactions). For the steady-state force-calcium relationship, our framework predicts that: (1) XB-RU effects are key in shifting the half-activation value of the force-calcium relationship towards lower [Ca2+], but have only small effects on cooperativity. (2) XB-XB effects approximately double the duty ratio of myosin, but do not significantly affect cooperativity. (3) RU-RU effects derived from the long-range action of tropomyosin are a major factor in cooperative activation, with each additional unblocked RU increasing the rate of additional RU's unblocking. (4) Myosin affinity for short (1-4 RU) unblocked stretches of actin of is very low, and the resulting suppression of force at low [Ca2+] is a major contributor in the biphasic force-calcium relationship. We also reproduce isometric tension development across mouse, rat and human at physiological temperature and pacing rate, and conclude that species differences require only changes in myosin affinity and troponin I/troponin C affinity. Furthermore, we show that the calcium dependence of the rate of tension redevelopment k(tr) is explained by transient blocking of RU's by a temporary decrease in XB-RU effects.","[Land, Sander; Niederer, Steven A.] Kings Coll London, Dept Biomed Engn, London, England","Land, S (reprint author), Kings Coll London, Dept Biomed Engn, London, England.",sander.land@kcl.ac.uk,,"Land, Sander/0000-0001-8572-251X; Niederer, Steven/0000-0002-4612-6982","Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council [BB/J017272/1]; British Heart Foundation [PG/11/101/29212, PG/13/37/30280]; EU FP7 [HEALTH-F4-2013-602156]; Department of Health via the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) comprehensive Biomedical Research Centre","SL is supported by the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BB/J017272/1).

To quantify this phenomenon via particle-based mesoscopic simulations, we developed a general framework for open boundary conditions in multiphase flows that is effective even for high hematocrit levels. The inflow at the inlet is duplicated from a fully developed flow generated in a pilot simulation with periodic boundary conditions. The outflow is controlled by adaptive forces to maintain the flow rate and velocity gradient at fixed values, while the particles leaving the arteriole at the outlet are removed from the system. Upon validation of this approach, we performed systematic 3D simulations to study plasma skimming in arterioles of diameters 20 to 32 microns. For a flow rate ratio 6: 1 at the branches, we observed the ""all-or-nothing"" phenomenon with plasma only entering the low flow rate branch. We then simulated blood-plasma separation in arteriolar bifurcations with different bifurcation angles and same diameter of the daughter branches. Our simulations predict a significant increase in RBC flux through the main daughter branch as the bifurcation angle is increased.

Pluripotent genes such as Oct4 and Nanog are activated in the pluripotent state, and their expression decreases during cell differentiation. Inversely, expression of differentiation genes such as Gata6 and Gata4 is promoted during differentiation. The gene regulatory network controlling the expression of these genes has been described, and slower-scale epigenetic modifications have been uncovered. Although the differentiation of pluripotent stem cells is normally irreversible, reprogramming of cells can be experimentally manipulated to regain pluripotency via overexpression of certain genes. Despite these experimental advances, the dynamics and mechanisms of differentiation and reprogramming are not yet fully understood. Based on recent experimental findings, we constructed a simple gene regulatory network including pluripotent and differentiation genes, and we demonstrated the existence of pluripotent and differentiated states from the resultant dynamical-systems model. Two differentiation mechanisms, interaction-induced switching from an expression oscillatory state and noise-assisted transition between bistable stationary states, were tested in the model. The former was found to be relevant to the differentiation process. We also introduced variables representing epigenetic modifications, which controlled the threshold for gene expression. By assuming positive feedback between expression levels and the epigenetic variables, we observed differentiation in expression dynamics. Additionally, with numerical reprogramming experiments for differentiated cells, we showed that pluripotency was recovered in cells by imposing overexpression of two pluripotent genes and external factors to control expression of differentiation genes. Interestingly, these factors were consistent with the four Yamanaka factors, Oct4, Sox2, Klf4, and Myc, which were necessary for the establishment of induced pluripotent stem cells. These results, based on a gene regulatory network and expression dynamics, contribute to our wider understanding of pluripotency, differentiation, and reprogramming of cells, and they provide a fresh viewpoint on robustness and control during development.","[Miyamoto, Tadashi; Kaneko, Kunihiko] Univ Tokyo, Dept Basic Sci, Meguro Ku, Tokyo, Japan; [Furusawa, Chikara] RIKEN, Quantitat Biol Ctr QBiC, Suita, Osaka, Japan","Miyamoto, T (reprint author), Univ Tokyo, Dept Basic Sci, Meguro Ku, Tokyo, Japan.",kaneko@complex.c.u-tokyo.ac.jp,"Furusawa, Chikara/N-6103-2015","Furusawa, Chikara/0000-0003-3554-4975","Japan Society for the Promotion of Science; Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology of Japan; Japan Science and Technology Agency","This work was funded by: the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science, TM; the Platform for Dynamic Approaches to Living System from the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology of Japan, KK; and the Dynamical Micro-scale Reaction Environment Project of the Japan Science and Technology Agency, KK.

Recent advancements in the detection and identification of palmitoylated proteins have led to multiple palmitoylation proteomics studies but these datasets are contained within large supplemental tables, making downstream analysis and data mining time-consuming and difficult. Consequently, we curated the data from 15 palmitoylation proteomics studies into one compendium containing 1,838 genes encoding palmitoylated proteins; representing approximately 10% of the genome. Enrichment analysis revealed highly significant enrichments for Gene Ontology biological processes, pathway maps, and process networks related to the nervous system. Strikingly, 41% of synaptic genes encode a palmitoylated protein in the compendium. The top disease associations included cancers and diseases and disorders of the nervous system, with Schizophrenia, HD, and pancreatic ductal carcinoma among the top five, suggesting that aberrant palmitoylation may play a pivotal role in the balance of cell death and survival. This compendium provides a much-needed resource for cell biologists and the palmitoylation field, providing new perspectives for cancer and neurodegeneration.","[Sanders, Shaun S.; Martin, Dale D.

However, current methods based on local approximations or on Monte-Cario sampling cope only insufficiently with high-dimensional parameter spaces associated with complex network models. Here, we propose an alternative deterministic methodology that relies on sparse polynomial approximations. We propose a deterministic computational interpolation scheme which identifies most significant expansion coefficients adaptively. We present its performance in kinetic model equations from computational systems biology with several hundred parameters and state variables, leading to numerical approximations of the parametric solution on the entire parameter space. The scheme is based on adaptive Smolyak interpolation of the parametric solution at judiciously and adaptively chosen points in parameter space. As Monte-Cario sampling, it is ""non-intrusive"" and well-suited for massively parallel implementation, but affords higher convergence rates. This opens up new avenues for large-scale dynamic network analysis by enabling scaling for many applications, including parameter estimation, uncertainty quantification, and systems design.","[Schillings, Claudia; Schwab, Christoph] ETH, Seminar Appl Math, Zurich, Switzerland; [Sunnaker, Mikael; Stelling, Joerg] ETH, Dept Biosyst Sci & Engn, Zurich, Switzerland; [Sunnaker, Mikael; Stelling, Joerg] ETH, Swiss Inst Bioinformat, Zurich, Switzerland","Schillings, C (reprint author), Univ Warwick, Inst Math, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England.",joerg.stelling@bsse.ethz.ch; christoph.schwab@sam.math.ethz.ch,"Stelling, Joerg/F-7499-2010","Stelling, Joerg/0000-0002-1145-891X",Swiss Initiative for Systems Biology SystemsX.ch; European Research Council (ERC) under ERC AdG [247277]; Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council [EP/K034154/1],"This work was supported by the Swiss Initiative for Systems Biology SystemsX.ch evaluated by the Swiss National Science Foundation (RTD project YeastX; to MS and JS) and by the European Research Council (ERC) under ERC AdG 247277 (to CSchi and CSchw).

In particular, school effects may predominate in pandemic seasons marked by an atypical concentration of cases among children. For the 2009 A/H1N1 pandemic, Mexico is a particularly interesting case study due to its broad geographic extent encompassing temperate and tropical regions, well-documented regional variation in the occurrence of pandemic outbreaks, and coincidence of several school breaks during the pandemic period. Here we fit a series of transmission models to daily laboratory-confirmed influenza data in 32 Mexican states using MCMC approaches, considering a meta-population framework or the absence of spatial coupling between states. We use these models to explore the effect of environmental, school-related and travel factors on the generation of spatially-heterogeneous pandemic waves. We find that the spatial structure of the pandemic is best understood by the interplay between regional differences in specific humidity (explaining the occurrence of pandemic activity towards the end of the school term in late May-June 2009 in more humid southeastern states), school vacations (preventing influenza transmission during July-August in all states), and regional differences in residual susceptibility (resulting in large outbreaks in early fall 2009 in central and northern Mexico that had yet to experience fully-developed outbreaks). Our results are in line with the concept that very high levels of specific humidity, as present during summer in southeastern Mexico, favor influenza transmission, and that school cycles are a strong determinant of pandemic wave timing.","[Tamerius, James] Univ Iowa, Dept Geog & Sustainabil Sci, Iowa City, IA 52242 USA; [Viboud, Cecile] NIH, Fogarty Int Ctr, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; [Shaman, Jeffrey] Columbia Univ, Environm Hlth Sci, New York, NY USA; [Chowell, Gerardo] Georgia State Univ, Sch Publ Hlth, Atlanta, GA 30303 USA","Tamerius, J (reprint author), Univ Iowa, Dept Geog & Sustainabil Sci, Iowa City, IA 52242 USA.",james-tamerius@uiowa.edu,,,"NIH [1U54GM088558]; NIEHS Center grant [ES009089]; RAPIDD program of the Science and Technology Directorate, US Department of Homeland Security; Fogarty International Center, NIH; Office of Global Affairs' International Influenza Unit, Office of the Secretary, US Department of Health and Human Services","Funding was provided by the NIH Models of Infectious Disease Agent Study program through cooperative agreement 1U54GM088558 (JT, JS), as well as NIEHS Center grant ES009089 (JS), the RAPIDD program of the Science and Technology Directorate, US Department of Homeland Security (JS), and the in-house influenza research program of the Fogarty International Center, NIH, funded by the Office of Global Affairs' International Influenza Unit, Office of the Secretary, US Department of Health and Human Services.

Nevertheless, we know little of how cell volume affects neuronal dynamics. We here performed the first detailed study of the effects of cell volume on neuronal dynamics. By incorporating cell swelling together with dynamic ion concentrations and oxygen supply into Hodgkin-Huxley type spiking dynamics, we demonstrate the spontaneous transition between epileptic seizure and spreading depression states as the cell swells and contracts in response to changes in osmotic pressure. Our use of volume as an order parameter further revealed a dynamical definition for the experimentally described physiological ceiling that separates seizure from spreading depression, as well as predicted a second ceiling that demarcates spreading depression from anoxic depolarization. Our model highlights the neuroprotective role of glial K buffering against seizures and spreading depression, and provides novel insights into anoxic depolarization and the relevant cell swelling during ischemia. We argue that the dynamics of seizures, spreading depression, and anoxic depolarization lie along a continuum of the repertoire of the neuron membrane that can be understood only when the dynamic ion concentrations, oxygen homeostasis, and cell swelling in response to osmotic pressure are taken into consideration. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of a unified framework for a wide range of neuronal behaviors that may be of substantial importance in the understanding of and potentially developing universal intervention strategies for these pathological states.","[Ullah, Ghanim] Univ S Florida, Dept Phys, Tampa, FL 33620 USA; [Wei, Yina] Univ Calif Riverside, Dept Cell Biol & Neurosci, Riverside, CA 92501 USA; [Dahlem, Markus A.] Humboldt Univ, D-10115 Berlin, Germany; [Wechselberger, Martin] Univ Sydney, Sch Math & Stat, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia; [Schiff, Steven J.] Penn State Univ, Ctr Neural Engn, Dept Engn Sci & Mech, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; [Schiff, Steven J.] Penn State Univ, Ctr Neural Engn, Dept Neurosurg, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; [Schiff, Steven J.] Penn State Univ, Ctr Neural Engn, Dept Phys, University Pk, PA 16802 USA","Ullah, G (reprint author), Univ S Florida, Dept Phys, Tampa, FL 33620 USA.",gullah@usf.edu,"Wei, Yina/I-8744-2016","Wei, Yina/0000-0001-8715-5715; Wechselberger, Martin/0000-0003-2681-3440",USF College of Arts and Sciences; NIH US-German Collaborative Research in Computational Neuroscience [1R01EB014641-01]; Bundesministerium fur Bildung und Forschung BMBF [01GQ1109]; Mathematical Biosciences Institute; National Science Foundation [DMS 0931642]; Australian Research Counsel (ARC) Future Fellowship grant,"Startup grant from USF College of Arts and Sciences (GU), NIH US-German Collaborative Research in Computational Neuroscience 1R01EB014641-01 (SJS), the Bundesministerium fur Bildung und Forschung BMBF 01GQ1109 (MAD), an Early Career Award (GU) and long-term visitor support (SJS, MW, MAD) from the Mathematical Biosciences Institute and the National Science Foundation under grant DMS 0931642, and Australian Research Counsel (ARC) Future Fellowship grant (MW).

A fundamental step in analyzing WGS and WES data is mapping short sequencing reads back to the reference genome. This is an important issue because incorrectly mapped reads affect the downstream variant discovery, genotype calling and association analysis. Although many read mapping algorithms have been developed, the majority of them uses the universal reference genome and do not take sequence variants into consideration. Given that genetic variants are ubiquitous, it is highly desirable if they can be factored into the read mapping procedure. In this work, we developed a novel strategy that utilizes genotypes obtained a priori to customize the universal haploid reference genome into a personalized diploid reference genome. The new strategy is implemented in a program named RefEditor. When applying RefEditor to real data, we achieved encouraging improvements in read mapping, variant discovery and genotype calling. Compared to standard approaches, RefEditor can significantly increase genotype calling consistency (from 43% to 61% at 4X coverage; from 82% to 92% at 20X coverage) and reduce Mendelian inconsistency across various sequencing depths. Because many WGS and WES studies are conducted on cohorts that have been genotyped using array-based genotyping platforms previously or concurrently, we believe the proposed strategy will be of high value in practice, which can also be applied to the scenario where multiple NGS experiments are conducted on the same cohort.

Here, we model a descending neural pathway that mediates short-latency proprioceptive information from a tactile sensor on the head to thoracic neural networks. We studied the nocturnal stick insect Carausius morosus, a model organism for the study of adaptive locomotion, including tactually mediated reaching movements. Like mammals, insects need to move their tactile sensors for probing the environment. Cues about sensor position and motion are therefore crucial for the spatial localization of tactile contacts and the coordination of fast, adaptive motor responses. Our model explains how proprioceptive information about motion and position of the antennae, the main tactile sensors in insects, can be encoded by a single type of mechanosensory afferents. Moreover, it explains how this information is integrated and mediated to thoracic neural networks by a diverse population of descending interneurons (DINs). First, we quantified responses of a DIN population to changes in antennal position, motion and direction of movement. Using principal component ( PC) analysis, we find that only two PCs account for a large fraction of the variance in the DIN response properties. We call the two-dimensional space spanned by these PCs `coding-space' because it captures essential features of the entire DIN population. Second, we model the mechanoreceptive input elements of this descending pathway, a population of proprioceptive mechanosensory hairs monitoring deflection of the antennal joints. Finally, we propose a computational framework that can model the response properties of all important DIN types, using the hair field model as its only input. This DIN model is validated by comparison of tuning characteristics, and by mapping the modelled neurons into the two-dimensional coding-space of the real DIN population. This reveals the versatility of the framework for modelling a complete descending neural pathway.","[Ache, Jan M.; Duerr, Volker] Univ Bielefeld, Fak Biol, Dept Biol Cybernet, Bielefeld, Germany; [Ache, Jan M.; Duerr, Volker] Univ Bielefeld, Cognit Interact Technol, Ctr Excellence, Bielefeld, Germany","Ache, JM (reprint author), Univ Bielefeld, Fak Biol, Dept Biol Cybernet, Bielefeld, Germany.",jan.m.ache@gmail.com; volker.duerr@uni-bielefeld.de,,"Ache, Jan M./0000-0001-7355-7860; Durr, Volker/0000-0001-9239-4964","Cluster of Excellence 277 ""Cognitive Interaction Technology"" (CITEC) - Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft [SP10]","This work was supported by grant SP10, awarded to VD by the Cluster of Excellence 277 ""Cognitive Interaction Technology"" (CITEC), funded through the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft.

Bayesian statistical inference describes how sensory and prior information can be combined optimally to guide behavior. An outstanding open question of how neural coding supports Bayesian inference includes how sensory cues are optimally integrated over time. Here we address what neural response properties allow a neural system to perform Bayesian prediction, i.e., predicting where a source will be in the near future given sensory information and prior assumptions. The work here shows that the population vector decoder will perform Bayesian prediction when the receptive fields of the neurons encode the target dynamics with shifting receptive fields. We test the model using the system that underlies sound localization in barn owls. Neurons in the owl's midbrain show shifting receptive fields for moving sources that are consistent with the predictions of the model. We predict that neural populations can be specialized to represent the statistics of dynamic stimuli to allow for a vector read-out of Bayes-optimal predictions.","[Cox, Weston] Seattle Univ, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Seattle, WA 98122 USA; [Fischer, Brian J.] Seattle Univ, Dept Math, Seattle, WA 98122 USA","Cox, W (reprint author), Seattle Univ, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Seattle, WA 98122 USA.",fischer9@seattleu.edu,,,U.S. National Institutes of Health grant [DC012949],"This work was funded by U.S. National Institutes of Health grant DC012949 to BJF.

Theoretical studies over the last twenty years have described various computational advantages for such regimes in neuronal systems. Nevertheless, it still remains unclear whether chaos requires specific cellular properties or network architectures, or whether it is a generic property of neuronal circuits. We investigate the dynamics of networks of excitatory-inhibitory (EI) spiking neurons with random sparse connectivity operating in the regime of balance of excitation and inhibition. Combining Dynamical Mean-Field Theory with numerical simulations, we show that chaotic, asynchronous firing rate fluctuations emerge generically for sufficiently strong synapses. Two different mechanisms can lead to these chaotic fluctuations. One mechanism relies on slow I-I inhibition which gives rise to slow subthreshold voltage and rate fluctuations. The decorrelation time of these fluctuations is proportional to the time constant of the inhibition. The second mechanism relies on the recurrent E-I-E feedback loop. It requires slow excitation but the inhibition can be fast. In the corresponding dynamical regime all neurons exhibit rate fluctuations on the time scale of the excitation. Another feature of this regime is that the population-averaged firing rate is substantially smaller in the excitatory population than in the inhibitory population. This is not necessarily the case in the I-I mechanism. Finally, we discuss the neurophysiological and computational significance of our results.","[Harish, Omri; Hansel, David] Univ Paris 05, Ctr Neurophys Physiol & Pathol, CNRS, UMR8119, Paris, France; [Harish, Omri; Hansel, David] Univ Paris 05, Inst Neurosci & Cognit, Paris, France; [Hansel, David] Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Alexander Silberman Inst Life Sci, Jerusalem, Israel","Harish, O (reprint author), Univ Paris 05, Ctr Neurophys Physiol & Pathol, CNRS, UMR8119, Paris, France.",david.hansel@parisdescartes.fr,,,Agence Nationale de la Recherche; France-Israel Laboratory of Neuroscience; France-Israel High Council for Science and Technology,"This work was funded by Agence Nationale de la Recherche, DH, France-Israel Laboratory of Neuroscience, DH, and France-Israel High Council for Science and Technology, DH.

While homeostasis is believed to be crucial for neural function, a systematic analysis of homeostatic control has largely been lacking. The analysis presented here analyses the necessary conditions for stable homeostatic control. We consider networks of neurons with homeostasis and show that homeostatic control that is stable for single neurons, can destabilize activity in otherwise stable recurrent networks leading to strong non-abating oscillations in the activity. This instability can be prevented by slowing down the homeostatic control. The stronger the network recurrence, the slower the homeostasis has to be. Next, we consider how non-linearities in the neural activation function affect these constraints. Finally, we consider the case that homeostatic feedback is mediated via a cascade of multiple intermediate stages. Counter-intuitively, the addition of extra stages in the homeostatic control loop further destabilizes activity in single neurons and networks. Our theoretical framework for homeostasis thus reveals previously unconsidered constraints on homeostasis in biological networks, and identifies conditions that require the slow time-constants of homeostatic regulation observed experimentally.","[Harnack, Daniel; Pelko, Miha; van Rossum, Mark C.

Two important derivations will be the translation of this information into a multiscale understanding of pathogenic variants and leveraging existing data to increase the power of existing and future studies through prioritization. We explore edge prediction on heterogeneous networks-graphs with multiple node and edge types-for accomplishing both tasks. First we constructed a network with 18 node types-genes, diseases, tissues, pathophysiologies, and 14 MSigDB (molecular signatures database) collections-and 19 edge types from high-throughput publicly-available resources. From this network composed of 40,343 nodes and 1,608,168 edges, we extracted features that describe the topology between specific genes and diseases. Next, we trained a model from GWAS associations and predicted the probability of association between each protein-coding gene and each of 29 well-studied complex diseases. The model, which achieved 132-fold enrichment in precision at 10% recall, outperformed any individual domain, highlighting the benefit of integrative approaches. We identified pleiotropy, transcriptional signatures of perturbations, pathways, and protein interactions as influential mechanisms explaining pathogenesis. Our method successfully predicted the results (with AUROC = 0.79) from a withheld multiple sclerosis (MS) GWAS despite starting with only 13 previously associated genes. Finally, we combined our network predictions with statistical evidence of association to propose four novel MS genes, three of which (JAK2, REL, RUNX3) validated on the masked GWAS. Furthermore, our predictions provide biological support highlighting REL as the causal gene within its gene-rich locus. Users can browse all predictions online (http://het.io). Heterogeneous network edge prediction effectively prioritized genetic associations and provides a powerful new approach for data integration across multiple domains.","[Himmelstein, Daniel S.; Baranzini, Sergio E.] Univ Calif San Francisco, Biol & Med Informat, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; [Baranzini, Sergio E.] Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Neurol, San Francisco, CA USA; [Baranzini, Sergio E.] Univ Calif San Francisco, Inst Human Genet, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA","Himmelstein, DS (reprint author), Univ Calif San Francisco, Biol & Med Informat, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA.",sebaran@cgl.ucsf.edu,"Himmelstein, Daniel S/J-8986-2013","Himmelstein, Daniel S/0000-0002-3012-7446",National Science Foundation [1144247]; National Multiple Sclerosis Society; National Institutes of Health [R01 NS088155],"This material is based upon work supported by the National Science Foundation under Grant No. 1144247 to DSH.

Therefore there exists a growing interest in the optimization of TCRs for medical purposes like adoptive T-cell therapy. However, the molecular mechanisms behind T-cell signaling are still predominantly unknown. For small sets of TCRs it was observed that the angle between their V alpha-and V beta-domains, which bind the epitope, can vary and might be important for epitope recognition. Here we present a comprehensive, quantitative study of the variation in the V alpha/V beta interdomain-angle and its influence on epitope recognition, performing a systematic bioinformatics analysis based on a representative set of experimental TCR structures. For this purpose we developed a new, cuboid-based superpositioning method, which allows a unique, quantitative analysis of the V alpha/V beta-angles. Angle-based clustering led to six significantly different clusters. Analysis of these clusters revealed the unexpected result that the angle is predominantly influenced by the TCR-clonotype, whereas the bound epitope has only a minor influence. Furthermore we could identify a previously unknown center of rotation (CoR), which is shared by all TCRs. All TCR geometries can be obtained by rotation around this center, rendering it a new, common TCR feature with the potential of improving the accuracy of TCR structure prediction considerably. The importance of V alpha/V beta rotation for signaling was confirmed as we observed larger variances in the V alpha/V beta-angles in unbound TCRs compared to epitope-bound TCRs. Our results strongly support a two-step mechanism for TCR-epitope: First, preformation of a flexible TCR geometry in the unbound state and second, locking of the V alpha/V beta-angle in a TCR-type specific geometry upon epitope-MHC association, the latter being driven by rotation around the unique center of rotation.","[Hoffmann, Thomas; Antes, Iris] Tech Univ Munich, Dept Biosci, Freising Weihenstephan, Germany; [Hoffmann, Thomas; Antes, Iris] Tech Univ Munich, Ctr Integrated Prot Sci Munich, Freising Weihenstephan, Germany; [Krackhardt, Angela M.] Tech Univ Munich, Med Klin 3, Innere Med Schwerpunkt Hamatol & Onkol, D-80290 Munich, Germany; [Krackhardt, Angela M.] Helmholtz Zentrum Munchen GmbH, German Ctr Environm Hlth, Clin Cooperat Grp, Antigen Specif T Cell Therapy, Munich, Germany; [Krackhardt, Angela M.] German Canc Consortium DKTK, Munich, Germany","Hoffmann, T (reprint author), Tech Univ Munich, Dept Biosci, Freising Weihenstephan, Germany.",antes@tum.de,,,CIPSM cluster of excellence [SFB1035]; DJCLS [R11/23];  [F2-F5121.7.3-10c/23932];  [110281],"TH and IA were funded by: CIPSM cluster of excellence; http://www.dfg.de/SFB1035; http://www.dfg.de/.AMK was funded by: DJCLS R11/23; https://www.carreras-stiftung.de/ F2-F5121.7.3-10c/23932; http://www.bayimmunet.de/ 110281; http://www.krebshilfe.de.

Despite intensive studies, molecular mechanisms of how Ago recognizes miRNA remain largely elusive. In this study, we propose a two-step mechanism for this molecular recognition: selective binding followed by structural re-arrangement. Our model is based on the results of a combination of Markov State Models (MSMs), large-scale protein-RNA docking, and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Using MSMs, we identify an open state of apo human Ago-2 in fast equilibrium with partially open and closed states. Conformations in this open state are distinguished by their largely exposed binding grooves that can geometrically accommodate miRNA as indicated in our protein-RNA docking studies. miRNA may then selectively bind to these open conformations. Upon the initial binding, the complex may perform further structural re-arrangement as shown in our MD simulations and eventually reach the stable binary complex structure. Our results provide novel insights in Ago-miRNA recognition mechanisms and our methodology holds great potential to be widely applied in the studies of other important molecular recognition systems.","[Jiang, Hanlun; Huang, Xuhui] Hong Kong Univ Sci & Technol, Div Biomed Engn, Bioengn Grad Program, Kowloon, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Jiang, Hanlun; Zhu, Lizhe; Huang, Xuhui] HKUST Shenzhen Res Inst, Shenzhen, Peoples R China; [Sheong, Fu Kit; Zhu, Lizhe; Huang, Xuhui] Hong Kong Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Chem, Kowloon, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Zhu, Lizhe; Huang, Xuhui] Hong Kong Univ Sci & Technol, Ctr Syst Biol & Human Hlth, Sch Sci, Kowloon, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Zhu, Lizhe; Huang, Xuhui] Hong Kong Univ Sci & Technol, Inst Adv Study, Kowloon, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Gao, Xin] King Abdullah Univ Sci & Technol, Comp Elect & Math Sci & Engn Div, Thuwal, Saudi Arabia; [Bernauer, Julie] Inria Saclay Ile France, Palaiseau, France; [Bernauer, Julie] Ecole Polytech, Lab Informat Ecole Polytech LIX, CNRS, UMR 7161, Palaiseau, France","Jiang, HL (reprint author), Hong Kong Univ Sci & Technol, Div Biomed Engn, Bioengn Grad Program, Kowloon, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",julie.bernauer@inria.fr; xuhuihuang@ust.hk,"Zhu, Lizhe/K-1139-2012; Gao, Xin/D-5487-2013","Zhu, Lizhe/0000-0001-8252-7807; Gao, Xin/0000-0002-7108-3574; Huang, Xuhui/0000-0002-7119-9358; Sheong, Fu Kit/0000-0002-3803-9985","National Science Foundation of China [21273188]; Hong Kong Research Grants Council [ECS 60981, AoE/M-09/12, T13-607/12R]; King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST); PROCORE-France/Hong Kong Joint Research Scheme - Research Grants Council; Consulate General of France in Hong Kong [F-HK29/11T]","XH acknowledges the support from National Science Foundation of China (no. 21273188), Hong Kong Research Grants Council ECS 60981, AoE/M-09/12, and T13-607/12R.

To understand this data we must comprehend how cells are distributed in a high-dimensional gene expression space. One open question is whether cell types form discrete clusters or whether gene expression forms a continuum of states. If such a continuum exists, what is its geometry? Recent theory on evolutionary trade-offs suggests that cells that need to perform multiple tasks are arranged in a polygon or polyhedron (line, triangle, tetrahedron and so on, generally called polytopes) in gene expression space, whose vertices are the expression profiles optimal for each task. Here, we analyze single-cell data from human and mouse tissues profiled using a variety of single-cell technologies. We fit the data to shapes with different numbers of vertices, compute their statistical significance, and infer their tasks. We find cases in which single cells fill out a continuum of expression states within a polyhedron. This occurs in intestinal progenitor cells, which fill out a tetrahedron in gene expression space. The four vertices of this tetrahedron are each enriched with genes for a specific task related to stemness and early differentiation. A polyhedral continuum of states is also found in spleen dendritic cells, known to perform multiple immune tasks: cells fill out a tetrahedron whose vertices correspond to key tasks related to maturation, pathogen sensing and communication with lymphocytes. A mixture of continuum-like distributions and discrete clusters is found in other cell types, including bone marrow and differentiated intestinal crypt cells. This approach can be used to understand the geometry and biological tasks of a wide range of single-cell datasets. The present results suggest that the concept of cell type may be expanded. In addition to discreet clusters in gene-expression space, we suggest a new possibility: a continuum of states within a polyhedron, in which the vertices represent specialists at key tasks.","[Korem, Yael; Szekely, Pablo; Hart, Yuval; Sheftel, Hila; Hausser, Jean; Mayo, Avi; Alon, Uri] Weizmann Inst Sci, Dept Mol Cell Biol, IL-76100 Rehovot, Israel; [Rothenberg, Michael E.] Stanford Univ, Dept Med, Div Gastroenterol & Hepatol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Rothenberg, Michael E.] Stanford Univ, Inst Stem Cell Biol & Regenerat Med, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Kalisky, Tomer] Bar Ilan Univ, Fac Engn, Ramat Gan, Israel","Korem, Y (reprint author), Weizmann Inst Sci, Dept Mol Cell Biol, IL-76100 Rehovot, Israel.",urialon@weizmann.ac.il,"mayo, avi/N-3756-2019","mayo, avi/0000-0002-4479-3423; Hausser, Jean/0000-0002-3321-7199","Human Frontier Science Program; Israel Science Foundation (ICORE) [1902/12, 1634/13, 2017/13]; Israel Cancer Association [20150911]; Israel Ministry of Health [3-10146]","The research leading to these results has received funding from The Human Frontier Science Program.

The DCM is an ensemble based statistical mechanical approach that accounts for enthalpy/entropy compensation due to network rigidity, which has been quite successful in elucidating conformational flexibility and Quantitative Stability/Flexibility Relationships (QSFR) in proteins. Applied to three disparate antibody systems changes in QSFR quantities indicate that the VH domain is typically rigidified, whereas the VL domain and CDR L2 loop become more flexible during affinity maturation. The increase in CDR H3 loop rigidity is consistent with other studies in the literature. The redistribution of conformational flexibility is largely controlled by nonspecific changes in the H-bond network, although certain Arg to Asp salt bridges create highly localized rigidity increases.

During development, emergence of Hebbian plasticity leads to formation of functional circuits. By modeling the dynamics of neurotransmitter release during early postnatal cortical development we show that a developmentally regulated switch in vesicle exocytosis mode triggers associative (i.e. Hebbian) plasticity. Early in development spontaneous vesicle exocytosis (SVE), often considered as 'synaptic noise', is important for homogenization of synaptic weights and maintenance of synaptic weights in the appropriate dynamic range. Our results demonstrate that SVE has a permissive, whereas subsequent evoked vesicle exocytosis (EVE) has an instructive role in the expression of Hebbian plasticity. A timed onset for Hebbian plasticity can be achieved by switching from SVE to EVE and the balance between SVE and EVE can control the effective rate of Hebbian plasticity. We further show that this developmental switch in neurotransmitter release mode enables maturation of spike-timing dependent plasticity. A mis-timed or inadequate SVE to EVE switch may lead to malformation of brain networks thereby contributing to the etiology of neurodevelopmental disorders.","[Martens, Marijn B.; Tiesinga, Paul H.

During neural network development in the brain, synapses are massively over-produced and then pruned-back over time. This strategy is not commonly used when designing engineered networks, since adding connections that will soon be removed is considered wasteful. Here, we show that for large distributed routing networks, network function is markedly enhanced by hyper-connectivity followed by aggressive pruning and that the global rate of pruning, a developmental parameter not previously studied by experimentalists, plays a critical role in optimizing network structure. We first used high-throughput image analysis techniques to quantify the rate of pruning in the mammalian neocortex across a broad developmental time window and found that the rate is decreasing over time. Based on these results, we analyzed a model of computational routing networks and show using both theoretical analysis and simulations that decreasing rates lead to more robust and efficient networks compared to other rates. We also present an application of this strategy to improve the distributed design of airline networks. Thus, inspiration from neural network formation suggests effective ways to design distributed networks across several domains.","[Navlakha, Saket] Salk Inst Biol Studies, Ctr Integrat Biol, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA; [Barth, Alison L.] Carnegie Mellon Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Ctr Neural Basis Cognit, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA; [Bar-Joseph, Ziv] Carnegie Mellon Univ, Lane Ctr Computat Biol, Machine Learning Dept, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA","Navlakha, S (reprint author), Salk Inst Biol Studies, Ctr Integrat Biol, 10010 N Torrey Pines Rd, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA.",barth@cmu.edu; zivbj@cs.cmu.edu,,,"National Institutes of Health [F32-MH099784, 0171-088]; McKnight Foundation; McDonnell Foundation programme on Studying Complex System; US National Science Foundation [DBI-0965316, DBI-1356505]","This work was supported in part by the National Institutes of Health award no.

To understand how changes in intracellular magnesium concentration regulate the influx of Mg2+ into cells, we examine early events in the relaxation of Mg2+ channel CorA toward its open state using massively-repeated molecular dynamics simulations conducted either with or without regulatory ions. The pore of CorA contains a 2-nm-long hydrophobic bottleneck which remained dehydrated in most simulations. However, rapid hydration or ""wetting"" events concurrent with small-amplitude fluctuations in pore diameter occurred spontaneously and reversibly. In the absence of regulatory ions, wetting transitions are more likely and include a wet state that is significantly more stable and more hydrated. The free energy profile for Mg2+ permeation presents a barrier whose magnitude is anticorrelated to pore diameter and the extent of hydrophobic hydration. These findings support an allosteric mechanism whereby wetting of a hydrophobic gate couples changes in intracellular magnesium concentration to the onset of ionic conduction.","[Neale, Chris; Chakrabarti, Nilmadhab; Pomes, Regis] Hosp Sick Children, Mol Struct & Funct, Toronto, ON M5G 1X8, Canada; [Neale, Chris; Pai, Emil F.; Pomes, Regis] Univ Toronto, Dept Biochem, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Pomorski, Pawel] Univ Waterloo, Dept Phys & Astron, Shared Hierarch Acad Res Comp Network, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1, Canada; [Pai, Emil F.] Univ Toronto, Dept Med Biophys, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Pai, Emil F.] Univ Toronto, Dept Mol Genet, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Pai, Emil F.] Campbell Family Inst Canc Res, Ontario Canc Inst, Princess Margaret Canc Ctr, Toronto, ON, Canada","Neale, C (reprint author), Hosp Sick Children, Mol Struct & Funct, 555 Univ Ave, Toronto, ON M5G 1X8, Canada.",pomes@sickkids.ca,"Pai, Emil/R-8908-2019","Pai, Emil/0000-0002-1162-7242","Canadian Institutes of Health Research; Research Training Center at the Hospital for Sick Children; University of Toronto; SHARCNET; Canadian Institutes of Health Research Operating Grant [MOP-86548, MOP-43949, MOP-43998]; Ontario Ministry of Health and Long Term Care; Canada Foundation for Innovation (CFI); Government of Ontario; Ontario Research Fund - Research Excellence","CN is funded by a postdoctoral fellowship from the Canadian Institutes of Health Research, by the Research Training Center at the Hospital for Sick Children, and by the University of Toronto.

For example, the galactose utilization network in Saccharomyces cerevisiae is activated by the presence of galactose but repressed by glucose. If both sugars are present, the yeast will first metabolize glucose, depleting it from the extracellular environment. Upon depletion of glucose, the genes encoding galactose metabolic proteins will activate. Here, we show that the rate at which glucose levels are depleted determines the timing and variability of galactose gene activation. Paradoxically, we find that Gal1p, an enzyme needed for galactose metabolism, accumulates more quickly if glucose is depleted slowly rather than taken away quickly. Furthermore, the variability of induction times in individual cells depends non-monotonically on the rate of glucose depletion and exhibits a minimum at intermediate depletion rates. Our mathematical modeling suggests that the dynamics of the metabolic transition from glucose to galactose are responsible for the variability in galactose gene activation. These findings demonstrate that environmental dynamics can determine the phenotypic outcome at both the single-cell and population levels.","[Nguyen-Huu, Truong D.; Ma, Bo; Bennett, Matthew R.] Rice Univ, Dept Biosci, Houston, TX 77005 USA; [Gupta, Chinmaya; Ott, William; Josic, Kresimir] Univ Houston, Dept Math, Houston, TX 77204 USA; [Josic, Kresimir] Univ Houston, Dept Biol & Biochem, Houston, TX USA; [Bennett, Matthew R.] Rice Univ, Inst Biosci & Bioengn, Houston, TX USA","Nguyen-Huu, TD (reprint author), Rice Univ, Dept Biosci, Houston, TX 77005 USA.",matthew.bennett@rice.edu,"Bennett, Matthew/B-3700-2008; Bennett, Maxwell/J-8504-2015","Bennett, Matthew/0000-0002-4975-8854; ",National Institutes of Health through NSF/NIGMS [R01GM104974]; Robert A.

Structurally characterizing these exchanges is challenging, both experimentally and computationally. Large, diffusional motions are often on timescales that are difficult to access with molecular dynamics simulations, especially for large proteins and their complexes. The low frequency modes of normal mode analysis (NMA) report on molecular fluctuations associated with biological activity. However, NMA is limited to a second order expansion about a minimum of the potential energy function, which limits opportunities to observe diffusional motions. By contrast, kino-geometric conformational sampling (KGS) permits large perturbations while maintaining the exact geometry of explicit conformational constraints, such as hydrogen bonds. Here, we extend KGS and show that a conformational ensemble of the subunit Gas of heterotrimeric stimulatory protein Gs exhibits structural features implicated in its activation pathway. Activation of protein Gs by G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) is associated with GDP release and large conformational changes of its a-helical domain. Our method reveals a coupled a-helical domain opening motion while, simultaneously, Gas helix a(5) samples an activated conformation. These motions are moderated in the activated state. The motion centers on a dynamic hub near the nucleotide-binding site of Gas, and radiates to helix a(4). We find that comparative NMA-based ensembles underestimate the amplitudes of the motion. Additionally, the ensembles fall short in predicting the accepted direction of the full activation pathway. Taken together, our findings suggest that nullspace sampling with explicit, holonomic constraints yields ensembles that illuminate molecular mechanisms involved in GDP release and protein Gs activation, and further establish conformational coupling between key structural elements of Gas.","[Pachov, Dimitar V.] Stanford Univ, Dept Chem, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [van den Bedem, Henry] Stanford Univ, Joint Ctr Struct Genom, Stanford Synchrotron Radiat Lightsource, Stanford, CA 94305 USA","Pachov, DV (reprint author), Stanford Univ, Dept Chem, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",vdbedem@stanford.edu,,"van den Bedem, Henry/0000-0003-2358-841X",US National Institute of General Medical Sciences Protein Structure Initiative [U54GM094586]; SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory LDRD (Laboratory Directed Research and Development) [SLAC-LDRD-0014-13-2],"HvdB is supported by the US National Institute of General Medical Sciences Protein Structure Initiative (U54GM094586) at the Joint Center for Structural Genomics.

Unfortunately, this information is distributed throughout the unstructured text of over 23 million articles. The creation of structured resources that catalog the relationships between drugs and genes would accelerate the translation of basic molecular knowledge into discoveries of genomic biomarkers for drug response and prediction of unexpected drug-drug interactions. Extracting these relationships from natural language sentences on such a large scale, however, requires text mining algorithms that can recognize when different looking statements are expressing similar ideas. Here we describe a novel algorithm, Ensemble Biclustering for Classification (EBC), that learns the structure of biomedical relationships automatically from text, overcoming differences in word choice and sentence structure. We validate EBC's performance against manually-curated sets of (1) pharmaco-genomic relationships from PharmGKB and (2) drug-target relationships from DrugBank, and use it to discover new drug-gene relationships for both knowledge bases. We then apply EBC to map the complete universe of drug-gene relationships based on their descriptions in Medline, revealing unexpected structure that challenges current notions about how these relationships are expressed in text. For instance, we learn that newer experimental findings are described in consistently different ways than established knowledge, and that seemingly pure classes of relationships can exhibit interesting chimeric structure.

The method has two components: a MM/PBSA-based component, and an additional set of statistical terms delivered from statistical investigation of physico-chemical properties of protein complexes. While the approach is rigid body approach and does not explicitly consider plausible conformational changes caused by the binding, the effect of conformational changes, including changes away from binding interface, on electrostatics are mimicked with amino acid specific dielectric constants. This provides significant improvement of SAAMBE predictions as indicated by better match against experimentally determined binding free energy changes over 1300 mutations in 43 proteins.

The CTD in its alpha-helical fold is stabilized by interactions with the N-terminal domain (NTD), masking an RNA polymerase binding site until a specific recruitment site is encountered. Domain dissociation is triggered upon binding to DNA, allowing the NTD to interact with RNA polymerase to facilitate transcription while the CTD refolds into the alpha-barrel conformation that interacts with the ribosome to activate translation. However, structural details of this transformation process in the context of the full protein remain to be elucidated. Here, we explore the mechanism of the alpha-to-beta conformational transition of RfaH in the full-length protein using a dual-basin structure-based model. Our simulations capture several features described experimentally, such as the requirement of disruption of interdomain contacts to trigger the alpha-to-beta transformation, confirms the roles of previously indicated residues E48 and R138, and suggests a new important role for F130, in the stability of the interdomain interaction. These native basins are connected through an intermediate state that builds up upon binding to the NTD and shares features from both folds, in agreement with previous in silico studies of the isolated CTD. We also examine the effect of RNA polymerase binding on the stabilization of the beta fold. Our study shows that native-biased models are appropriate for interrogating the detailed mechanisms of structural rearrangements during the dramatic transformation process of RfaH.","[Ramirez-Sarmiento, Cesar A.; Valenzuela, Sandro L.] Univ Chile, Fac Ciencias, Dept Biol, Santiago, Chile; [Noel, Jeffrey K.] Rice Univ, Ctr Theoret Biol Phys, Houston, TX USA; [Artsimovitch, Irina] Ohio State Univ, Dept Microbiol, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [Artsimovitch, Irina] Ohio State Univ, Ctr RNA Biol, Columbus, OH 43210 USA","Ramirez-Sarmiento, CA (reprint author), Univ Chile, Fac Ciencias, Dept Biol, Santiago, Chile.",ceramirez@uchile.cl; artsimovitch.1@osu.edu,"Artsimovitch, Irina/L-3467-2019","Ramirez, Cesar/0000-0003-4647-903X","FONDECYT [11140601]; NIH [GM67153]; supercomputing infrastructure of the NLHPC [ECM-02]; Welch Foundation [C-1792]; Center for Theoretical Biological Physics - NSF [PHY-1427654, NSF-MCB-1214457]","This work was supported by FONDECYT (Initiation into Research Grant No. 11140601 to CARS), the NIH (Grant GM67153 to IA) and partially supported by the supercomputing infrastructure of the NLHPC (ECM-02).

Natural populations interact with each other in a variety of ways and, although most published ecological networks only include information about a single interaction type (e.g., feeding, pollination), ecologists are beginning to consider networks which combine multiple interaction types. Here we extend the group model to signed directed networks such as ecological interaction webs. As a specific application of this method, we examine the effects of including or excluding specific interaction types on our understanding of species roles in ecological networks. We consider all three currently available interaction webs, two of which are extended plant-mutualist networks with herbivores and parasitoids added, and one of which is an extended intertidal food web with interactions of all possible sign structures (+/+, -/ 0, etc.). Species in the extended food web grouped similarly with all interactions, only trophic links, and only nontrophic links. However, removing mutualism or herbivory had a much larger effect in the extended plant-pollinator webs. Species removal even affected groups that were not directly connected to those that were removed, as we found by excluding a small number of parasitoids. These results suggest that including additional species in the network provides far more information than additional interactions for this aspect of network structure. Our methods provide a useful framework for simplifying networks to their essential structure, allowing us to identify generalities in network structure and better understand the roles species play in their communities.","[Sander, Elizabeth L.; Wootton, J.

Here we investigate how particular features of network connectivity underpin the propensity of neural networks to generate slow-switching assembly (SSA) dynamics, i.e., sustained epochs of increased firing within assemblies of neurons which transition slowly between different assemblies throughout the network. We show that the emergence of SSA activity is linked to spectral properties of the asymmetric synaptic weight matrix. In particular, the leading eigenvalues that dictate the slow dynamics exhibit a gap with respect to the bulk of the spectrum, and the associated Schur vectors exhibit a measure of block-localization on groups of neurons, thus resulting in coherent dynamical activity on those groups. Through simple rate models, we gain analytical understanding of the origin and importance of the spectral gap, and use these insights to develop new network topologies with alternative connectivity paradigms which also display SSA activity. Specifically, SSA dynamics involving excitatory and inhibitory neurons can be achieved by modifying the connectivity patterns between both types of neurons. We also show that SSA activity can occur at multiple timescales reflecting a hierarchy in the connectivity, and demonstrate the emergence of SSA in small-world like networks. Our work provides a step towards understanding how network structure (uncovered through advancements in neuroanatomy and connectomics) can impact on spatio-temporal neural activity and constrain the resulting dynamics.","[Schaub, Michael T.; Barahona, Mauricio] Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Dept Math, London, England; [Billeh, Yazan N.] CALTECH, Computat & Neural Syst Program, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA; [Anastassiou, Costas A.; Koch, Christof] Allen Inst Brain Sci, Seattle, WA USA","Schaub, MT (reprint author), Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Dept Math, London, England.",michael.schaub09@imperial.ac.uk; ybilleh@caltech.edu,"Barahona, Mauricio/M-9747-2019; Barahona, Mauricio/C-3638-2008","Barahona, Mauricio/0000-0002-1089-5675; Barahona, Mauricio/0000-0002-1089-5675; Billeh, Yazan/0000-0001-5200-4992; Koch, Christof/0000-0001-6482-8067","Studienstiftung des deutschen Volkes; Santander Mobility Award; Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) of UK [EP/I017267/1]; Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF) [PA00P3-131470]; Human Frontier Sciences Program (HFSP) [RGP0032/2011]; National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) [R01 NS074015]; Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council [EP/I017267/1, EP/I032223/1]","MTS acknowledges support from the Studienstiftung des deutschen Volkes and a Santander Mobility Award.

Multi-specificity design (MSD), on the other hand, involves considering the stability of multiple protein states simultaneously. We have developed a novel MSD algorithm, which we refer to as REstrained CONvergence in multi-specificity design (RECON). The algorithm allows each state to adopt its own sequence throughout the design process rather than enforcing a single sequence on all states. Convergence to a single sequence is encouraged through an incrementally increasing convergence restraint for corresponding positions. Compared to MSD algorithms that enforce (constrain) an identical sequence on all states the energy landscape is simplified, which accelerates the search drastically. As a result, RECON can readily be used in simulations with a flexible protein backbone. We have benchmarked RECON on two design tasks. First, we designed antibodies derived from a common germline gene against their diverse targets to assess recovery of the germline, polyspecific sequence. Second, we design ""promiscuous"", polyspecific proteins against all binding partners and measure recovery of the native sequence. We show that RECON is able to efficiently recover native-like, biologically relevant sequences in this diverse set of protein complexes.","[Sevy, Alexander M.; Meiler, Jens] Vanderbilt Univ, Struct Biol Ctr, Nashville, TN 37235 USA; [Jacobs, Tim M.] Univ N Carolina, Dept Biochem, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA; [Crowe, James E., Jr.] Vanderbilt Univ, Med Ctr, Vanderbilt Vaccine Ctr, Nashville, TN USA; [Meiler, Jens] Vanderbilt Univ, Dept Chem, Nashville, TN USA","Sevy, AM (reprint author), Vanderbilt Univ, Struct Biol Ctr, 221 Kirkland Hall, Nashville, TN 37235 USA.",jens.meiler@vanderbilt.edu,"Crowe, James E./B-5549-2009","Crowe, James E./0000-0002-0049-1079; Jacobs, Tim/0000-0002-1062-2634; Meiler, Jens/0000-0001-8945-193X","National Institute of Allergy and Infection Disease/National Institutes of Health [R56 AI 110750, T32 AI 89554]","This work was supported by National Institute of Allergy and Infection Disease/National Institutes of Health R56 AI 110750 and National Institute of Allergy and Infection Disease/National Institutes of Health T32 AI 89554.

In particular, all vertebrates descend from two rounds of WGDs, that occurred in their jawless ancestor some 500 MY ago. Paralogs retained from WGD, also coined 'ohnologs' after Susumu Ohno, have been shown to be typically associated with development, signaling and gene regulation. Ohnologs, which amount to about 20 to 35% of genes in the human genome, have also been shown to be prone to dominant deleterious mutations and frequently implicated in cancer and genetic diseases. Hence, identifying ohnologs is central to better understand the evolution of vertebrates and their susceptibility to genetic diseases. Early computational analyses to identify vertebrate ohnologs relied on content-based synteny comparisons between the human genome and a single invertebrate outgroup genome or within the human genome itself. These approaches are thus limited by lineage specific rearrangements in individual genomes. We report, in this study, the identification of vertebrate ohnologs based on the quantitative assessment and integration of synteny conservation between six amniote vertebrates and six invertebrate outgroups. Such a synteny comparison across multiple genomes is shown to enhance the statistical power of ohnolog identification in vertebrates compared to earlier approaches, by overcoming lineage specific genome rearrangements. Ohnolog gene families can be browsed and downloaded for three statistical confidence levels or recompiled for specific, user-defined, significance criteria at http://ohnologs.curie.fr/. In the light of the importance of WGD on the genetic makeup of vertebrates, our analysis provides a useful resource for researchers interested in gaining further insights on vertebrate evolution and genetic diseases.","[Singh, Param Priya; Arora, Jatin; Isambert, Herve] UPMC, CNRS UMR168, Inst Curie, Res Ctr, Paris, France","Singh, PP (reprint author), Stanford Univ, Dept Genet, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",param@stanford.edu; herve.isambert@curie.fr,,"Arora, Jatin/0000-0002-7754-9566",Erasmus Mundus (UPMC); La Ligue Contre le Cancer; Foundation Pierre-Gilles de Gennes [FPGG025],"PPS acknowledges a PhD fellowship from Erasmus Mundus (UPMC) and La Ligue Contre le Cancer.

In the preceding stage of the cell cycle (the ""stalked"" cell), DivL is localized uniformly along the cell membrane and maintained in an inactive form by DivK similar to P. It is unclear how DivL overcomes inhibition by DivK similar to P in the predivisional cell simply by changing its location to the new pole. It has been suggested that co-localization of DivL with PleC phosphatase at the new pole is essential to DivL's activity there. However, there are contrasting views on whether the bifunctional enzyme, PleC, acts as a kinase or phosphatase at the new pole. To explore these ambiguities, we formulated a mathematical model of the spatiotemporal distributions of DivL, PleC and associated proteins (DivJ, DivK, CckA, and CtrA) during the asymmetric division cycle of a Caulobacter cell. By varying localization profiles of DivL and PleC in our model, we show how the physiologically observed spatial distributions of these proteins are essential for the transition from a stalked cell to a predivisional cell. Our simulations suggest that PleC is a kinase in predivisional cells, and that, by sequestering DivK similar to P, the kinase form of PleC enables DivL to be reactivated at the new pole. Hence, co-localization of PleC kinase and DivL is essential to establishing cellular asymmetry. Our simulations reproduce the experimentally observed spatial distribution and phosphorylation status of CtrA in wild-type and mutant cells. Based on the model, we explore novel combinations of mutant alleles, making predictions that can be tested experimentally.","[Subramanian, Kartik] Virginia Polytech Inst & State Univ, Grad Program Genet Bioinformat & Computat Biol, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA; [Paul, Mark R.] Virginia Polytech Inst & State Univ, Dept Mech Engn, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA; [Tyson, John J.] Virginia Polytech Inst & State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA; [Tyson, John J.] Virginia Polytech Inst & State Univ, Virginia Bioinformat Inst, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA","Subramanian, K (reprint author), Virginia Polytech Inst & State Univ, Grad Program Genet Bioinformat & Computat Biol, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA.",tyson@vt.edu,"Paul, Mark/E-3567-2014; Tyson, John J/A-2942-2014","Paul, Mark/0000-0002-0701-1955; Tyson, John J/0000-0001-7560-6013; Subramanian, Kartik/0000-0002-6900-8882",National Science Foundation (Division of Mathematical Sciences) [1225160],"This work was funded by National Science Foundation (Division of Mathematical Sciences-1225160).

NO provides homeostatic control of intrinsic excitability. Here we conduct a theoretical investigation of the distinguishing roles of NO-mediated diffusive homeo-stasis in comparison with canonical non-diffusive homeostasis in cortical networks. We find that both forms of homeostasis provide a robust mechanism for maintaining stable activity following perturbations. However, the resulting networks differ, with diffusive homeostasis maintaining substantial heterogeneity in activity levels of individual neurons, a feature disrupted in networks with non-diffusive homeostasis. This results in networks capable of representing input heterogeneity, and linearly responding over a broader range of inputs than those undergoing non-diffusive homeostasis. We further show that these properties are preserved when homeostatic and Hebbian plasticity are combined.

A CTF scheme that relied on a codon-based prediction of translational rates exhibited folding probability markedly higher than that by the refolding scheme. When the CTF schedule is speeded up, the success rate dropped. These agree with experiments. Structural investigation clarified that misfolding of the middle domain was much more frequent in the refolding scheme than that in the codon-based CTF scheme. The middle domain is less stable and can fold via interactions with the folded N-terminal domain.

Electrically asynchronous activation causes myocardial contraction heterogeneity that can be detrimental for cardiac function. Computational models provide a tool for understanding pathological consequences of dyssynchronous contraction. Simulations of mechanical dyssynchrony within the heart are typically performed using the finite element method, whose computational intensity may present an obstacle to clinical deployment of patient-specific models. We present an alternative based on the CircAdapt lumped-parameter model of the heart and circulatory system, called the MultiPatch module. Cardiac walls are subdivided into an arbitrary number of patches of homogeneous tissue. Tissue properties and activation time can differ between patches. All patches within a wall share a common wall tension and curvature. Consequently, spatial location within the wall is not required to calculate deformation in a patch. We test the hypothesis that activation time is more important than tissue location for determining mechanical deformation in asynchronous hearts. We perform simulations representing an experimental study of myocardial deformation induced by ventricular pacing, and a patient with LBBB and heart failure using endocardial recordings of electrical activation, wall volumes, and end-diastolic volumes. Direct comparison between simulated and experimental strain patterns shows both qualitative and quantitative agreement between model fibre strain and experimental circumferential strain in terms of shortening and rebound stretch during ejection. Local myofibre strain in the patient simulation shows qualitative agreement with circumferential strain patterns observed in the patient using tagged MRI. We conclude that the MultiPatch module produces realistic regional deformation patterns in the asynchronous heart and that activation time is more important than tissue location within a wall for determining myocardial deformation. The CircAdapt model is therefore capable of fast and realistic simulations of dyssynchronous myocardial deformation embedded within the closed-loop cardiovascular system.","[Walmsley, John; Arts, Theo; Delhaas, Tammo; Lumens, Joost] Maastricht Univ, Dept Biomed Engn, Cardiovasc Res Inst Maastricht CARIM, Maastricht, Netherlands; [Derval, Nicolas; Bordachar, Pierre; Cochet, Hubert; Ploux, Sylvain; Lumens, Joost] CHU Bordeaux, Hop Cardiol Haut Leveque, IHU LIRYC, Bordeaux, France; [Prinzen, Frits W.] Maastricht Univ, Dept Physiol, Cardiovasc Res Inst Maastricht CARIM, Maastricht, Netherlands","Walmsley, J (reprint author), Maastricht Univ, Dept Biomed Engn, Cardiovasc Res Inst Maastricht CARIM, Maastricht, Netherlands.",j.walmsley@maastrichtuniversity.nl,,"Cochet, Hubert/0000-0001-7772-5331; Lumens, Joost/0000-0001-8129-7384","French Government, Agence National de la Recherche au titre du programme Investissements d'Avenir","JW and JL were funded through a personal grant within the framework of the Dr E.

Recent analyses of commuting patterns and travel behavior in high-income countries have led to the suggestion that these models are highly generalizable, and as a result, gravity and radiation models have become standard tools for describing population mobility dynamics for infectious disease epidemiology. Communities in Sub-Saharan Africa may not conform to these models, however; physical accessibility, availability of transport, and cost of travel between locations may be variable and severely constrained compared to high-income settings, informal labor movements rather than regular commuting patterns are often the norm, and the rise of mega-cities across the continent has important implications for travel between rural and urban areas. Here, we first review how infectious disease frameworks incorporate human mobility on different spatial scales and use anonymous mobile phone data from nearly 15 million individuals to analyze the spatiotemporal dynamics of the Kenyan population. We find that gravity and radiation models fail in systematic ways to capture human mobility measured by mobile phones; both severely overestimate the spatial spread of travel and perform poorly in rural areas, but each exhibits different characteristic patterns of failure with respect to routes and volumes of travel. Thus, infectious disease frameworks that rely on spatial interaction models are likely to misrepresent population dynamics important for the spread of disease in many African populations.","[Wesolowski, Amy; Eagle, Nathan; Buckee, Caroline O.] Harvard Univ, Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Epidemiol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Wesolowski, Amy; Buckee, Caroline O.] Harvard Univ, Sch Publ Hlth, Ctr Communicable Dis Dynam, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [O'Meara, Wendy Prudhomme] Duke Univ, Dept Med, Durham, NC USA; [O'Meara, Wendy Prudhomme] Duke Global Hlth Inst, Durham, NC USA; [Eagle, Nathan] Northeastern Univ, Coll Comp & Informat Sci, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Tatem, Andrew J.] Univ Southampton, Dept Geog & Environm, Southampton, Hants, England; [Tatem, Andrew J.] NIH, Fogarty Int Ctr, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA","Wesolowski, A (reprint author), Harvard Univ, Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Epidemiol, Boston, MA 02115 USA.",cbuckee@hsph.harvard.edu,,,"National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship [0750271]; James S.

However, in subtropical and tropical regions, influenza epidemics can occur throughout the year, making routine forecast of influenza more challenging. Here we develop and report forecast systems that are able to predict irregular non-seasonal influenza epidemics, using either the ensemble adjustment Kalman filter or a modified particle filter in conjunction with a susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) model. We applied these model-filter systems to retrospectively forecast influenza epidemics in Hong Kong from January 1998 to December 2013, including the 2009 pandemic. The forecast systems were able to forecast both the peak timing and peak magnitude for 44 epidemics in 16 years caused by individual influenza strains (i.e., seasonal influenza A(H1N1), pandemic A (H1N1), A(H3N2), and B), as well as 19 aggregate epidemics caused by one or more of these influenza strains. Average forecast accuracies were 37% (for both peak timing and magnitude) at 1-3 week leads, and 51% (peak timing) and 50% (peak magnitude) at 0 lead. Forecast accuracy increased as the spread of a given forecast ensemble decreased; the forecast accuracy for peak timing (peak magnitude) increased up to 43% (45%) for H1N1, 93% (89%) for H3N2, and 53% (68%) for influenza B at 1-3 week leads. These findings suggest that accurate forecasts can be made at least 3 weeks in advance for subtropical and tropical regions.","[Yang, Wan; Shaman, Jeffrey] Columbia Univ, Dept Environm Hlth Sci, Mailman Sch Publ Hlth, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Cowling, Benjamin J.; Lau, Eric H.

Despite numerous biochemical and biophysical studies, it remains elusive whether the ""secondary channel"" is the only route for NTP to reach the active site of the enzyme or if the ""main channel"" could be an alternative. On this regard, crystallographic structures of Pol II have been extremely useful to understand the structural basis of transcription, however, the conformation of the unpaired non-template DNA part of the full transcription bubble (TB) is still unknown. Since diffusion routes of the nucleoside triphosphate (NTP) substrate through the main channel might overlap with the TB region, gaining structural information of the full TB is critical for a complete understanding of Pol II transcription process. In this study, we have built a structural model of Pol II with a complete transcription bubble based on multiple sources of existing structural data and used Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations together with structural analysis to shed light on NTP entry pathways. Interestingly, we found that although both channels have enough space to allow NTP loading, the percentage of MD conformations containing enough space for NTP loading through the secondary channel is twice higher than that of the main channel. Further energetic study based on MD simulations with NTP loaded in the channels has revealed that the diffusion of the NTP through the main channel is greatly disfavored by electrostatic repulsion between the NTP and the highly negatively charged backbones of nucleotides in the non-template DNA strand. Taken together, our results suggest that the secondary channel is the major route for NTP entry during Pol II transcription.","[Zhang, Lu; Silva, Daniel-Adriano; Pardo-Avila, Fatima; Huang, Xuhui] Hong Kong Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Sci & IAS, Dept Chem, Ctr Syst Biol & Human Hlth, Kowloon, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Lu; Silva, Daniel-Adriano; Pardo-Avila, Fatima; Huang, Xuhui] Hong Kong Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Sci & IAS, State Key Lab Mol Neurosci, Ctr Syst Biol & Human Hlth, Kowloon, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Wang, Dong] Univ Calif San Diego, Skaggs Sch Pharm & Pharmaceut Sci, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA","Zhang, L (reprint author), Hong Kong Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Sci & IAS, Dept Chem, Ctr Syst Biol & Human Hlth, Kowloon, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",xuhuihuang@ust.hk,,"Silva Manzano, Daniel/0000-0002-3195-9009; Huang, Xuhui/0000-0002-7119-9358","Hong Kong Research Grant Council [16302214, 609813, AoE/M-09/12, M-HKUST601/13, T13-607/12R]; National Science Foundation of China [21273188]; National Institutes of Health [GM102362]; Hong Kong PhD Fellowship Scheme [PF10-17123]; Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Technologia Fellowship [215482]","This work was supported by the Hong Kong Research Grant Council http://www.ugc.edu.hk/eng/rgc/[grant numbers 16302214, 609813, AoE/M-09/12, M-HKUST601/13, and T13-607/12R to XH]; National Science Foundation of China http://www.nsfc.gov.cn/publish/portal1/ [grant number 21273188 to XH]; National Institutes of Health http://grants.nih.gov/grants/oer.htm [grant number GM102362 to DW]; Hong Kong PhD Fellowship Scheme www.ugc.edu.hk/eng/rgc/hkphd/ [grant number PF10-17123 to FPA] and Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Technologia Fellowship www.conacyt.mx [grant number 215482 to FPA].

While modeling studies could potentially shed light on the critical role played by inhibition in cortical computation, there is a gap between the simplicity of many models of sensory coding and the biological complexity of the inhibitory subpopulation. In particular, many models do not respect that inhibition must be implemented in a separate subpopulation, with those inhibitory interneurons having a diversity of tuning properties and characteristic E/I cell ratios. In this study we demonstrate a computational framework for implementing inhibition in dynamical systems models that better respects these biophysical observations about inhibitory interneurons. The main approach leverages recent work related to decomposing matrices into low-rank and sparse components via convex optimization, and explicitly exploits the fact that models and input statistics often have low-dimensional structure that can be exploited for efficient implementations. While this approach is applicable to a wide range of sensory coding models (including a family of models based on Bayesian inference in a linear generative model), for concreteness we demonstrate the approach on a network implementing sparse coding. We show that the resulting implementation stays faithful to the original coding goals while using inhibitory interneurons that are much more biophysically plausible.","[Zhu, Mengchen] Georgia Inst Technol, Wallace H Coulter Dept Biomed Engn, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA; [Rozell, Christopher J.] Georgia Inst Technol, Sch Elect & Comp Engn, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA","Zhu, MC (reprint author), Georgia Inst Technol, Wallace H Coulter Dept Biomed Engn, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA.",crozell@gatech.edu,,,NIH under CRCNS program [R01EY019965],"This work was partially supported by NIH grant R01EY019965 awarded under the CRCNS program.

Hence, evidence of asymmetry may provide clues to underlying population structure, even when direct information on, for example, stage of infection or contact rates, are missing. However, current tests of phylogenetic asymmetry (a) suffer from false positives when the tips of the phylogeny are sampled at different times and (b) only test for global asymmetry, and hence suffer from false negatives when asymmetry is localised to part of a phylogeny. We present a simple permutation-based approach for testing for asymmetry in a phylogeny, where we compare the observed phylogeny with random phylogenies with the same sampling and coalescence times, to reduce the false positive rate. We also demonstrate how profiles of measures of asymmetry calculated over a range of evolutionary times in the phylogeny can be used to identify local asymmetry. In combination with different metrics of asymmetry, this combined approach offers detailed insights of how phylogenies reconstructed from real viral datasets may deviate from the simplistic assumptions of commonly used coalescent and birth-death process models.","[Dearlove, Bethany L.; Frost, Simon D.

These data are available for users to test the software, complete tutorials and develop novel GMS pipeline configurations.","[Griffith, Malachi; Griffith, Obi L.; Smith, Scott M.; Ramu, Avinash; Callaway, Matthew B.; Brummett, Anthony M.; Kiwala, Michael J.; Coffman, Adam C.; Regier, Allison A.; Oberkfell, Ben J.; Sanderson, Gabriel E.; Mooney, Thomas P.; Nutter, Nathaniel G.; Belter, Edward A.; Du, Feiyu; Long, Robert L.; Abbott, Travis E.; Ferguson, Ian T.; Morton, David L.; Burnett, Mark M.; Weible, James V.; Peck, Joshua B.; Dukes, Adam; McMichael, Joshua F.; Lolofie, Justin T.; Derickson, Brian R.; Hundal, Jasreet; Skidmore, Zachary L.; Ainscough, Benjamin J.; Dees, Nathan D.; Schierding, William S.; Kandoth, Cyriac; Kim, Kyung H.; Lu, Charles; Harris, Christopher C.; Maher, Christopher A.; Magrini, Vincent J.; Abbott, Benjamin S.; Chen, Ken; Clark, Eric; Das, Indraniel; Fan, Xian; Hawkins, Amy E.; Hepler, Todd G.; Wylie, Todd N.; Leonard, Shawn M.; Schroeder, William E.; Shi, Xiaoqi; Carmichael, Lynn K.; Weil, Matthew R.; Wohlstadter, Richard W.; Stiehr, Gary; McLellan, Michael D.; Pohl, Craig S.; Miller, Christopher A.; Koboldt, Daniel C.; Walker, Jason R.; Eldred, James M.; Larson, David E.; Dooling, David J.; Ding, Li; Mardis, Elaine R.; Wilson, Richard K.] Washington Univ, Genome Inst, St Louis, MO 63130 USA; [Griffith, Malachi; Magrini, Vincent J.; Larson, David E.; Ding, Li; Mardis, Elaine R.; Wilson, Richard K.] Washington Univ, Sch Med, Dept Genet, St Louis, MO 63110 USA; [Griffith, Obi L.; Maher, Nicole; Maher, Christopher A.; Mardis, Elaine R.; Wilson, Richard K.] Washington Univ, Sch Med, Dept Med, St Louis, MO 63110 USA; [Maher, Christopher A.; Ding, Li; Mardis, Elaine R.; Wilson, Richard K.] Washington Univ, Sch Med, Siteman Canc Ctr, St Louis, MO USA; [Mardis, Elaine R.; Wilson, Richard K.] Washington Univ, Sch Med, Dept Mol Microbiol, St Louis, MO 63110 USA","Griffith, M (reprint author), Washington Univ, Genome Inst, St Louis, MO 63130 USA.",mgriffit@genome.wustl.edu; ogriffit@genome.wustl.edu,"Griffith, Malachi/P-1285-2014; Griffith, Obi/P-1286-2014","Griffith, Malachi/0000-0002-6388-446X; Miller, Christopher/0000-0003-4266-6700; Ramu, Avinash/0000-0003-3799-809X; Skidmore, Zachary/0000-0003-1928-7139; Ainscough, Benjamin/0000-0001-8340-514X; Schierding, William/0000-0001-5659-2701; Griffith, Obi/0000-0002-0843-4271",NHGRI Large Scale Sequencing and Analysis Center grant [U54 HG003079]; NHGRI Genome Sequencing Informatics Tools (GS-IT) Program [U01 HG006517]; Amazon AWS in Education Research Grant,"The development of the Genome Modeling System was funded by an NHGRI Large Scale Sequencing and Analysis Center grant (U54 HG003079) to RKW.

Some microbes interact via syntrophic associations, in which the metabolic by-products of one species serve as nutrients for another. These associations sustain a variety of natural communities, including those involved in methanogenesis. In anaerobic syntrophic communities, energy is transferred from one species to another, either through direct contact and exchange of electrons, or through small molecule diffusion. Thermodynamics plays an important role in governing these interactions, as the oxidation reactions carried out by the first community member are only possible because degradation products are consumed by the second community member. This work presents the development and analysis of genome-scale network reconstructions of the bacterium Syntrophobacter fumaroxidans and the methanogenic archaeon Methanospirillum hungatei. The models were used to verify proposed mechanisms of ATP production within each species. We then identified additional constraints and the cellular objective function required to match experimental observations. The thermodynamic S. fumaroxidans model could not explain why S. fumaroxidans does not produce H-2 in monoculture, indicating that current methods might not adequately estimate the thermodynamics, or that other cellular processes (e.g., regulation) play a role. We also developed a thermodynamic coculture model of the association between the organisms. The coculture model correctly predicted the exchange of both H2 and formate between the two species and suggested conditions under which H2 and formate produced by S. fumaroxidans would be fully consumed by M. hungatei.","[Hamilton, Joshua J.; Contreras, Montserrat Calixto; Reed, Jennifer L.] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Chem & Biol Engn, Madison, WI 53706 USA","Hamilton, JJ (reprint author), Univ Wisconsin, Dept Chem & Biol Engn, Madison, WI 53706 USA.",reed@engr.wisc.edu,"Reed, Jennifer/E-5137-2011","Reed, Jennifer/0000-0001-7854-6220; Hamilton, Joshua/0000-0001-9790-3609",National Science Foundation through CAREER grant [NSF 1053712]; National Science Foundation through Graduate Research Fellowship [DGE-0718123],"This work was funded by the National Science Foundation through a CAREER grant to JLR (NSF 1053712) and a Graduate Research Fellowship to JJH (DGE-0718123).

The latter has classically been described by contrast-induced gain changes that depend on temporal frequency. Here, we explored a new perspective on contrast-induced changes in temporal filtering by using spike-triggered covariance analysis to extract multiple parallel temporal filters for individual ganglion cells. Based on multielectrode-array recordings from ganglion cells in the isolated salamander retina, we found that contrast adaptation of temporal filtering can largely be captured by contrast-invariant sets of filters with contrast-dependent weights. Moreover, differences among the ganglion cells in the filter sets and their contrast-dependent contributions allowed us to phenomenologically distinguish three types of filter changes. The first type is characterized by newly emerging features at higher contrast, which can be reproduced by computational models that contain response-triggered gain-control mechanisms. The second type follows from stronger adaptation in the Off pathway as compared to the On pathway in On-Off-type ganglion cells. Finally, we found that, in a subset of neurons, contrast-induced filter changes are governed by particularly strong spike-timing dynamics, in particular by pronounced stimulus-dependent latency shifts that can be observed in these cells. Together, our results show that the contrast dependence of temporal filtering in retinal ganglion cells has a multifaceted phenomenology and that a multi-filter analysis can provide a useful basis for capturing the underlying signal-processing dynamics.","[Liu, Jian K.; Gollisch, Tim] Univ Med Ctr Groningen, Dept Ophthalmol, Gottingen, Germany; [Liu, Jian K.; Gollisch, Tim] Bernstein Ctr Computat Neurosci Gottingen, Gottingen, Germany","Liu, JK (reprint author), Univ Med Ctr Groningen, Dept Ophthalmol, Gottingen, Germany.",tim.gollisch@med.uni-goettingen.de,"Liu, Jian K./E-1748-2013; 889, CRC/L-1607-2018; Liu, Jian/S-3197-2019","Liu, Jian K./0000-0002-5391-7213; 889, CRC/0000-0002-6678-3138; Liu, Jian/0000-0002-5391-7213; Gollisch, Tim/0000-0003-3998-533X","International Human Frontier Science Program Organization by Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft [GO 1408/2-1]; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (Collaborative Research Cente); European Union Seventh Framework Program [FP7-ICT-2011.9.11, 600954]","This work was supported by the International Human Frontier Science Program Organization, by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (GO 1408/2-1 and Collaborative Research Center 889, C1), and by the European Union Seventh Framework Programme (FP7-ICT-2011.9.11) under grant agreement no 600954 (""VISUALISE"").

It is still unclear how the information from different neurons can be combined together to estimate the position of an object. Here we recorded a large population of ganglion cells in a dense patch of salamander and guinea pig retinas while displaying a bar moving diffusively. We show that the bar's position can be reconstructed from retinal activity with a precision in the hyperacuity regime using a linear decoder acting on 100+ cells. We then took advantage of this unprecedented precision to explore the spatial structure of the retina's population code. The classical view would have suggested that the firing rates of the cells form a moving hill of activity tracking the bar's position. Instead, we found that most ganglion cells in the salamander fired sparsely and idiosyncratically, so that their neural image did not track the bar. Furthermore, ganglion cell activity spanned an area much larger than predicted by their receptive fields, with cells coding for motion far in their surround. As a result, population redundancy was high, and we could find multiple, disjoint subsets of neurons that encoded the trajectory with high precision. This organization allows for diverse collections of ganglion cells to represent high-accuracy motion information in a form easily read out by downstream neural circuits.","[Marre, Olivier; Berry, Michael J., II] Princeton Univ, Dept Mol Biol, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [Marre, Olivier; Berry, Michael J., II] Princeton Univ, Inst Neurosci, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [Marre, Olivier] UPMC UM 80, CNRS UMR 7210, Inst Vis, INSERM UMRS 968, Paris, France; [Botella-Soler, Vicente; Tkacik, Gasper] IST Austria, Klosterneuburg, Austria; [Simmons, Kristina D.] Univ Penn, Dept Psychol, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Mora, Thierry] Ecole Normale Super, Phys Stat Lab, CNRS, F-75231 Paris, France; [Mora, Thierry] UPMC, Paris, France","Marre, O (reprint author), Princeton Univ, Dept Mol Biol, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA.",olivier.marre@inserm.fr,"Marre, Olivier/F-2751-2017; Botella-Soler, Vicente/C-6702-2012","Marre, Olivier/0000-0002-0090-6190; Botella-Soler, Vicente/0000-0002-8790-1914","ANR OPTIMA; French State program Investissements d'Avenir [ANR-10-LABX-65]; EC grant from Human Brain Project (CLAP); Austrian Research Foundation [FWF P25651]; MEC, Spain [AYA2010- 22111-C03-02, AYA2013-48623-C2-2]; MEC, Spain (FEDER Fund);  [EY 014196];  [EY 017934]","This work was supported by grants EY 014196 and EY 017934 to MJB, ANR OPTIMA, the French State program Investissements d'Avenir managed by the Agence Nationale de la Recherche [LIFESENSES: ANR-10-LABX-65], and by a EC grant from the Human Brain Project (CLAP) to OM, the Austrian Research Foundation FWF P25651 to VBS and GT.

Much of this research has focused on surveys of microbial diversities across a variety of host species, including humans, with a view to understanding how these microbiomes are distributed across space and time, and how they correlate with host health, disease, phenotype, physiology and ecology. Fewer studies have focused on how these microbiomes may have evolved. In this paper, we develop an agent-based framework to study the dynamics of microbiome evolution. Our framework incorporates neutral models of how hosts acquire their microbiomes, and how the environmental microbial community that is available to the hosts is assembled. Most importantly, our framework also incorporates a Wright-Fisher genealogical model of hosts, so that the dynamics of microbiome evolution is studied on an evolutionary timescale. Our results indicate that the extent of parental contribution to microbial availability from one generation to the next significantly impacts the diversity of microbiomes: the greater the parental contribution, the less diverse the microbiomes. In contrast, even when there is only a very small contribution from a constant environmental pool, microbial communities can remain highly diverse. Finally, we show that our models may be used to construct hypotheses about the types of processes that operate to assemble microbiomes over evolutionary time.","[Zeng, Qinglong; Sukumaran, Jeet; Wu, Steven; Rodrigo, Allen] Duke Univ, Dept Biol, Durham, NC 27708 USA","Zeng, QL (reprint author), Duke Univ, Dept Biol, Durham, NC 27708 USA.",a.rodrigo@duke.edu,"Rodrigo, Allen/E-8905-2015","Rodrigo, Allen/0000-0002-8327-7317","US National Science Foundation; NIH [R01-GM101352, R01-HG007178]","AR was partially supported by the US National Science Foundation through a grant awarded to the National Evolutionary Synthesis Center.

While there is much supporting evidence for the expression of alternative transcripts, the same is not true for the alternatively spliced protein products. Large-scale mass spectroscopy experiments have identified evidence of alternative splicing at the protein level, but with conflicting results. Here we carried out a rigorous analysis of the peptide evidence from eight large-scale proteomics experiments to assess the scale of alternative splicing that is detectable by high-resolution mass spectroscopy. We find fewer splice events than would be expected: we identified peptides for almost 64% of human protein coding genes, but detected just 282 splice events. This data suggests that most genes have a single dominant isoform at the protein level. Many of the alternative isoforms that we could identify were only subtly different from the main splice isoform. Very few of the splice events identified at the protein level disrupted functional domains, in stark contrast to the two thirds of splice events annotated in the human genome that would lead to the loss or damage of functional domains. The most striking result was that more than 20% of the splice isoforms we identified were generated by substituting one homologous exon for another. This is significantly more than would be expected from the frequency of these events in the genome. These homologous exon substitution events were remarkably conserved-all the homologous exons we identified evolved over 460 million years ago-and eight of the fourteen tissue-specific splice isoforms we identified were generated from homologous exons. The combination of proteomics evidence, ancient origin and tissue-specific splicing indicates that isoforms generated from homologous exons may have important cellular roles.","[Abascal, Federico; Rodriguez-Rivas, Juan; Valencia, Alfonso; Tress, Michael L.] Spanish Natl Canc Res Ctr CNIO, Struct Biol & Bioinformat Programme, Madrid, Spain; [Ezkurdia, Iakes] CNIC, Unidad Prote, Madrid, Spain; [Manuel Rodriguez, Jose; Valencia, Alfonso] Spanish Natl Canc Res Ctr CNIO, INB, Madrid, Spain; [del Pozo, Angela] Hosp Univ La Paz, Inst Genet Med & Mol, Madrid, Spain; [Vazquez, Jesus] CNIC, Lab Prote Cardiovasc, Madrid, Spain","Abascal, F (reprint author), Spanish Natl Canc Res Ctr CNIO, Struct Biol & Bioinformat Programme, Madrid, Spain.",valencia@cnio.es; mtress@cnio.es,"Valencia, Alfonso/I-3127-2015; Rodriguez, Jose josemrc/R-4018-2018; Vazquez, Jesus/B-7697-2015; Ezkurdia, Iakes/H-9334-2015","Valencia, Alfonso/0000-0002-8937-6789; Rodriguez, Jose josemrc/0000-0002-9948-5073; Vazquez, Jesus/0000-0003-1461-5092; del Pozo, Angela/0000-0001-6690-1619; Ezkurdia, Iakes/0000-0001-9074-5302; Rodriguez-Rivas, Juan/0000-0001-6262-9371","National Institutes of Health [U41 HG007234]; Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation [BIO2012-40205, BIO2012/37926, RD07-0067-0014]; Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation [COMBIOMED]; Instituto de Salud Carlos III [RIC-RD12/0042/0056, PT13/0001/0017]; Spanish National Institute of Bioinformatics, ""Instituto de Salud Carlos III"" [INB-ISCIII] [PRB2]","This work was supported by the National Institutes of Health [grant number U41 HG007234], by the Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation [grant numbers BIO2012-40205, BIO2012/37926 and RD07-0067-0014, COMBIOMED] and by the ""Instituto de Salud Carlos III"" [grant numbers RIC-RD12/0042/0056 and PT13/0001/0017].

Models that incorporate decision-making mechanisms can furthermore capture how behaviour-driven aspects of transmission such as vaccination choices and the use of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) interact with disease dynamics. However, these two interventions are usually modelled separately. Here, we construct a simulation model of influenza transmission through a contact network, where individuals can choose whether to become vaccinated and/or practice NPIs. These decisions are based on previous experience with the disease, the current state of infection amongst one's contacts, and the personal and social impacts of the choices they make. We find that the interventions interfere with one another: because of negative feedback between intervention uptake and infection prevalence, it is difficult to simultaneously increase uptake of all interventions by changing utilities or perceived risks. However, on account of vaccine efficacy being higher than NPI efficacy, measures to expand NPI practice have only a small net impact on influenza incidence due to strongly mitigating feedback from vaccinating behaviour, whereas expanding vaccine uptake causes a significant net reduction in influenza incidence, despite the reduction of NPI practice in response. As a result, measures that support expansion of only vaccination (such as reducing vaccine cost), or measures that simultaneously support vaccination and NPIs (such as emphasizing harms of influenza infection, or satisfaction from preventing infection in others through both interventions) can significantly reduce influenza incidence, whereas measures that only support expansion of NPI practice (such as making hand sanitizers more available) have little net impact on influenza incidence. (However, measures that improve NPI efficacy may fare better.) We conclude that the impact of interference on programs relying on multiple interventions should be more carefully studied, for both influenza and other infectious diseases.","[Andrews, Michael A.; Bauch, Chris T.] Univ Guelph, Dept Math & Stat, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada; [Bauch, Chris T.] Univ Waterloo, Dept Appl Math, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1, Canada","Andrews, MA (reprint author), Univ Guelph, Dept Math & Stat, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada.",mandre04@uoguelph.ca,,,Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (NSERC) Discovery Grant [298305-2009],"This research was supported by the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (NSERC) Discovery Grant to CTB (Grant #: 298305-2009, http://www.nserc-crsng.gc.ca/).

In our study, we carried out all-atom molecular dynamics simulations for arbitrarily long microtubules that have either GDP or GTP molecules in the E-site of beta-tubulin. A detailed energy balance of the MM/GBSA inter-dimer interaction energy per residue contributing to the overall lateral and longitudinal structural stability was performed. The obtained results identified the key residues and tubulin domains according to their energetic contributions. They also identified the molecular forces that drive microtubule disassembly. At the tip of the plus end of the microtubule, the uneven distribution of longitudinal interaction energies within a protofilament generates a torque that bends tubulin outwardly with respect to the cylinder's axis causing disassembly. In the presence of GTP, this torque is opposed by lateral interactions that prevent outward curling, thus stabilizing the whole microtubule. Once GTP hydrolysis reaches the tip of the microtubule (lateral cap), lateral interactions become much weaker, allowing tubulin dimers to bend outwards, causing disassembly. The role of magnesium in the process of outward curling has also been demonstrated. This study also showed that the microtubule seam is the most energetically labile inter-dimer interface and could serve as a trigger point for disassembly. Based on a detailed balance of the energetic contributions per amino acid residue in the microtubule, numerous other analyses could be performed to give additional insights into the properties of microtubule dynamic instability.","[Ayoub, Ahmed T.; Klobukowski, Mariusz] Univ Alberta, Dept Chem, Edmonton, AB, Canada; [Tuszynski, Jack A.] Univ Alberta, Dept Oncol, Edmonton, AB, Canada; [Tuszynski, Jack A.] Univ Alberta, Dept Phys, Edmonton, AB, Canada","Ayoub, AT (reprint author), Univ Alberta, Dept Chem, Edmonton, AB, Canada.",jackt@ualberta.ca,,,Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC),"MK and JAT received partial funding for this project from individual Discovery grant provided by the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC).

However, cooperative traits are vulnerable to exploitation by non-cooperators (cheaters). We expand our understanding of the molecular mechanisms that allow multicellular systems to remain robust in the face of cheating by dissecting the dynamic regulation of cooperative rhamnolipids required for swarming in Pseudomonas aeruginosa. We combine mathematical modeling and experiments to quantitatively characterize the integration of metabolic and population density signals (quorum sensing) governing expression of the rhamnolipid synthesis operon rhlAB. The combined computational/experimental analysis reveals that when nutrients are abundant, rhlAB promoter activity increases gradually in a density dependent way. When growth slows down due to nutrient limitation, rhlAB promoter activity can stop abruptly, decrease gradually or even increase depending on whether the growth-limiting nutrient is the carbon source, nitrogen source or iron. Starvation by specific nutrients drives growth on intracellular nutrient pools as well as the qualitative rhlAB promoter response, which itself is modulated by quorum sensing. Our quantitative analysis suggests a supply-driven activation that integrates metabolic prudence with quorum sensing in a non-digital manner and allows P. aeruginosa cells to invest in cooperation only when the population size is large enough (quorum sensing) and individual cells have enough metabolic resources to do so (metabolic prudence). Thus, the quantitative description of rhlAB regulatory dynamics brings a greater understating to the regulation required to make swarming cooperation stable.","[Boyle, Kerry E.; Xavier, Joao B.] Weill Cornell Grad Sch Med Sci, Program Immunol & Microbial Pathogenesis, New York, NY 10065 USA; [Boyle, Kerry E.; Monaco, Hilary; van Ditmarsch, Dave; Deforet, Maxime; Xavier, Joao B.] Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, Program Computat Biol, New York, NY 10021 USA; [Monaco, Hilary; Xavier, Joao B.] Triinst Training Program Computat Biol & Med, New York, NY USA","Boyle, KE (reprint author), Weill Cornell Grad Sch Med Sci, Program Immunol & Microbial Pathogenesis, New York, NY 10065 USA.",xavierj@mskcc.org,"Deforet, Maxime/I-3591-2019","Deforet, Maxime/0000-0002-1377-6727; van Ditmarsch, Dave/0000-0001-7780-0119","Lucille Castori Center for Microbes, Inflammation, and Cancer; Office of the Director, National Institutes of Health of the National Institutes of Health [DP2OD008440, T32 AI007621]; National Science Foundation [GRFP DGE-1257284 2012]","This work was supported by the Lucille Castori Center for Microbes, Inflammation, and Cancer, and by the Office of the Director, National Institutes of Health of the National Institutes of Health under Award Number DP2OD008440 to JBX, and Award Number T32 AI007621 to KEB and a National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship GRFP DGE-1257284 2012 to HM.

It has previously been hypothesized that this regression results from an intrinsic volatility in these memories, resulting in an inevitable decay in the absence of ongoing error signals. However, a recently-proposed alternative posits that even recently-acquired motor memories are intrinsically stable, decaying only if a change in context is detected. This new theory, the context-dependent decay hypothesis, makes two key predictions: (1) after error signals are withheld, decay onset should be systematically delayed until the context change is detected; and (2) manipulations that impair detection by masking context changes should result in prolonged delays in decay onset and reduced decay amplitude at any given time. Here we examine the decay of motor adaptation following the learning of novel environmental dynamics in order to carefully evaluate this hypothesis. To account for potential issues in previous work that supported the context-dependent decay hypothesis, we measured decay using a balanced and baseline-referenced experimental design that allowed for direct comparisons between analogous masked and unmasked context changes. Using both an unbiased variant of the previous decay onset analysis and a novel highly-powered group-level version of this analysis, we found no evidence for systematically delayed decay onset nor for the masked context change affecting decay amplitude or its onset time. We further show how previous estimates of decay onset latency can be substantially biased in the presence of noise, and even more so with correlated noise, explaining the discrepancy between the previous results and our findings. Our results suggest that the decay of motor memories is an intrinsic feature of error-based learning that does not depend on context change detection.","[Brennan, Andrew E.; Smith, Maurice A.] Harvard Univ, Sch Engn & Appl Sci, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Smith, Maurice A.] Harvard Univ, Ctr Brain Sci, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA","Brennan, AE (reprint author), Harvard Univ, Sch Engn & Appl Sci, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",mas@seas.harvard.edu,,,McKnight Scholar Award; Sloan Research Fellowship; National Institute of Aging [R01 AG041878]; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada,"This work was supported in part by the McKnight Scholar Award, a Sloan Research Fellowship, and a grant from the National Institute of Aging (R01 AG041878) to MAS and by Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada Postgraduate Scholarship-Doctoral to AEB.

The understanding of mechanisms leading to group cohesion is essential for understanding the collective dynamics of groups and the spatio-temporal distribution of organisms in environment. In this view, social aggregation in terrestrial isopods represents an interesting model due to its recurrence both in the field and in the laboratory. In this study, and under a perturbation context, we experimentally tested the stability of groups of woodlice according to group size and time spent in group. Our results indicate that the response to the disturbance of groups decreases with increases in these two variables. Models neglecting social effects cannot reproduce experimental data, attesting that cohesion of aggregation in terrestrial isopods is partly governed by a social effect. In particular, models involving calmed and excited individuals and a social transition between these two behavioural states more accurately reproduced our experimental data. Therefore, we concluded that group cohesion (and collective response to stimulus) in terrestrial isopods is governed by a transitory resting state under the influence of density of conspecifics and time spent in group. Lastly, we discuss the nature of direct or indirect interactions possibly implicated.","[Broly, Pierre; Deneubourg, Jean-Louis] Univ Libre Bruxelles, Unite Ecol Sociale, Brussels, Belgium; [Broly, Pierre] Univ Lille Nord France, UCLILLE, Fac Gest Econ & Sci, Lab Ecol & Biodivers, Lille, France","Broly, P (reprint author), Univ Libre Bruxelles, Unite Ecol Sociale, Campus Plaine, Brussels, Belgium.",pierre.broly@icl-lille.fr,,,"FRIA grant (Fonds pour la Recherche dans l'Industrie et dans l'Agriculture, FRS-FNRS)","PB is supported by a FRIA grant (Fonds pour la Recherche dans l'Industrie et dans l'Agriculture, FRS-FNRS).

In this study, we combine previously reported biochemical and high-resolution crystallographic data with structural mass spectroscopy and electron microscopic data to derive a detailed, experimentally-supported quaternary structure of the spectrin heterotetramer. In addition to explaining spectrin's physiological resting length of similar to 55-65 nm, our model provides a mechanism by which spectrin is able to undergo a seamless three-fold extension while remaining a linear filament, an experimentally observed property. According to the proposed model, spectrin's quaternary structure and mechanism of extension is similar to a Chinese Finger Trap: at shorter molecular lengths spectrin is a hollow cylinder that extends by increasing the pitch of each spectrin repeat, which decreases the internal diameter. We validated our model with electron microscopy, which demonstrated that, as predicted, spectrin is hollow at its biological resting length of similar to 55-65 nm. The model is further supported by zero-length chemical crosslink data indicative of an approximately 90 degree bend between adjacent spectrin repeats. The domain-domain interactions in our model are entirely consistent with those present in the prototypical linear antiparallel heterotetramer as well as recently reported inter-strand chemical crosslinks. The model is consistent with all known physical properties of spectrin, and upon full extension our Chinese Finger Trap Model reduces to the similar to 180-200 nm molecular model currently in common use.","[Brown, Jeffrey W.; Bullitt, Esther; McKnight, C.

Here clarification was sought for cases where interactions of different ligands with the same disordered protein region yield qualitatively different results. Specifically, conformational ensembles for the disordered lid region of the N-terminal domain of the oncoprotein MDM2 in the presence of different ligands were computed by means of a novel combination of accelerated molecular dynamics, umbrella sampling, and variational free energy profile methodologies. The resulting conformational ensembles for MDM2, free and bound to p53 TAD (17-29) peptide identify lid states compatible with previous NMR measurements. Remarkably, the MDM2 lid region is shown to adopt distinct conformational states in the presence of different small-molecule ligands. Detailed analyses of small-molecule bound ensembles reveal that the ca. 25-fold affinity improvement of the piperidinone family of inhibitors for MDM2 constructs that include the full lid correlates with interactions between ligand hydrophobic groups and the C-terminal lid region that is already partially ordered in apo MDM2. By contrast, Nutlin or benzodiazepinedione inhibitors, that bind with similar affinity to full lid and lid-truncated MDM2 constructs, interact additionally through their solubilizing groups with N-terminal lid residues that are more disordered in apo MDM2.","[Bueren-Calabuig, Juan A.; Michel, Julien] Univ Edinburgh, EaStCHEM Sch Chem, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland","Bueren-Calabuig, JA (reprint author), Univ Edinburgh, EaStCHEM Sch Chem, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland.",julien.michel@ed.ac.uk,,"Bueren-Calabuig, Juan A./0000-0003-3665-9002","Royal Society University Research Fellowship; Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) [EP/K002082/1]; Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council [EP/L000253/1, EP/K002082/1]","JM is supported by a Royal Society University Research Fellowship (https://royalsociety.org/).

While both experimental and modeling work has been conducted to understand the molecular genetic mechanisms involved in CD4+ T cell responses and fate attainment, the dynamic role of intrinsic (produced by CD4+ T lymphocytes) versus extrinsic (produced by other cells) components remains unclear, and the mechanistic and dynamic understanding of the plastic responses of these cells remains incomplete. In this work, we studied a regulatory network for the core transcription factors involved in CD4+ T cell-fate attainment. We first show that this core is not sufficient to recover common CD4+ T phenotypes. We thus postulate a minimal Boolean regulatory network model derived from a larger and more comprehensive network that is based on experimental data. The minimal network integrates transcriptional regulation, signaling pathways and the micro-environment. This network model recovers reported configurations of most of the characterized cell types (Th0, Th1, Th2, Th17, Tfh, Th9, iTreg, and Foxp3-independent T regulatory cells). This transcriptional-signaling regulatory network is robust and recovers mutant configurations that have been reported experimentally. Additionally, this model recovers many of the plasticity patterns documented for different T CD4 + cell types, as summarized in a cell-fate map. We tested the effects of various micro-environments and transient perturbations on such transitions among CD4+ T cell types. Interestingly, most cell-fate transitions were induced by transient activations, with the opposite behavior associated with transient inhibitions. Finally, we used a novel methodology was used to establish that T-bet, TGF-beta and suppressors of cytokine signaling proteins are keys to recovering observed CD4+ T cell plastic responses. In conclusion, the observed CD4+ T cell-types and transition patterns emerge from the feedback between the intrinsic or intracellular regulatory core and the micro-environment. We discuss the broader use of this approach for other plastic systems and possible therapeutic interventions.","[Esther Martinez-Sanchez, Mariana; Alvarez-Buylla, Elena R.] Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Inst Ecol, Dept Ecol Func, Mexico City 04510, DF, Mexico; [Esther Martinez-Sanchez, Mariana; Villarreal, Carlos; Alvarez-Buylla, Elena R.] Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Ctr Ciencias Complejidad, Mexico City 04510, DF, Mexico; [Mendoza, Luis] Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Inst Invest Biomed, Dept Biol Mol & Biotecnol, Mexico City 04510, DF, Mexico; [Villarreal, Carlos] Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Inst Fis, Dept Fis Teor, Mexico City 01000, DF, Mexico","Martinez-Sanchez, ME (reprint author), Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Inst Ecol, Dept Ecol Func, Mexico City 04510, DF, Mexico.",eabuylla@gmail.com,"Villarreal, Carlos/D-7530-2016; Mendoza, Luis/A-3167-2009","Mendoza, Luis/0000-0002-3321-3083","Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia Mexico [180380, 180098]; Programa de Apoyo a Proyectos de Investigacion e Innovacion Tecnologica Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico [IN203113, IN204011, IN226510-3, IN203814, IN200514]; graduate program ""Doctorado en Ciencias Biomedicas, de la Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico""","This work was supported by grants from: Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia Mexico (www.conacyt.mx): 180380 to CV and ERAB, and 180098 to (ERAB).

The time-course gene set analysis (TcGSA) introduced here is an extension of gene set analysis to longitudinal data. The proposed method relies on random effects modeling with maximum likelihood estimates. It allows to use all available repeated measurements while dealing with unbalanced data due to missing at random (MAR) measurements. TcGSA is a hypothesis driven method that identifies a priori defined gene sets with significant expression variations over time, taking into account the potential heterogeneity of expression within gene sets. When biological conditions are compared, the method indicates if the time patterns of gene sets significantly differ according to these conditions. The interest of the method is illustrated by its application to two real life datasets: an HIV therapeutic vaccine trial (DALIA-1 trial), and data from a recent study on influenza and pneumococcal vaccines. In the DALIA-1 trial TcGSA revealed a significant change in gene expression over time within 69 gene sets during vaccination, while a standard univariate individual gene analysis corrected for multiple testing as well as a standard a Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) for time series both failed to detect any significant pattern change over time. When applied to the second illustrative data set, TcGSA allowed the identification of 4 gene sets finally found to be linked with the influenza vaccine too although they were found to be associated to the pneumococcal vaccine only in previous analyses. In our simulation study TcGSA exhibits good statistical properties, and an increased power compared to other approaches for analyzing time-course expression patterns of gene sets. The method is made available for the community through an R package.","[Hejblum, Boris P.; Thiebaut, Rodolphe] Univ Bordeaux, ISPED, Ctr INSERM Epidemiol Biostat U897, F-33000 Bordeaux, France; [Hejblum, Boris P.; Thiebaut, Rodolphe] INSERM, ISPED, Ctr INSERM Epidemiol Biostat U897, F-33000 Bordeaux, France; [Hejblum, Boris P.; Thiebaut, Rodolphe] INRIA, Team SISTM, F-33000 Bordeaux, France; [Hejblum, Boris P.; Skinner, Jason; Thiebaut, Rodolphe] Hop Henri Mondor, VRI, F-94010 Creteil, France; [Hejblum, Boris P.; Skinner, Jason; Thiebaut, Rodolphe] Baylor Inst Immunol Res, Dallas, TX USA","Hejblum, BP (reprint author), Univ Bordeaux, ISPED, Ctr INSERM Epidemiol Biostat U897, F-33000 Bordeaux, France.",rodolphe.thiebaut@u-bordeaux.fr,,"Hejblum, Boris/0000-0003-0646-452X; Skinner, Jason/0000-0002-2408-7695","Investissements d'Avenir program [ANR-10-LABX-77]; Vaccine Research Institute (VRI), Creteil, France; Ecole des Hautes Etudes en Sante Publique (EHESP) Doctoral Network; French National Agency for Research on AIDS and Viral Hepatitis (ANRS: L'Agence Nationale pour la Recherche contre le SIDA et les hepatites virales)","This work was supported by the Investissements d'Avenir program managed by the ANR under reference ANR-10-LABX-77 and by the Vaccine Research Institute (VRI), F-94010 Creteil, France.

They have been the target of various recent experiments, with healthy participants and psychiatric populations engaging as dyads in multi-round exchanges such as a repeated trust task. Behaviour in such exchanges involves complexities related to each agent's preference for equity with their partner, beliefs about the partner's appetite for equity, beliefs about the partner's model of their partner, and so on. Agents may also plan different numbers of steps into the future. Providing a computationally precise account of the behaviour is an essential step towards understanding what underlies choices. A natural framework for this is that of an interactive partially observable Markov decision process (IPOMDP). However, the various complexities make IPOMDPs inordinately computationally challenging. Here, we show how to approximate the solution for the multi-round trust task using a variant of the Monte-Carlo tree search algorithm. We demonstrate that the algorithm is efficient and effective, and therefore can be used to invert observations of behavioural choices. We use generated behaviour to elucidate the richness and sophistication of interactive inference.","[Hula, Andreas; Montague, P.

In order to understand how this neural variability constrains behavioral performance, we need to be able to measure the reliability with which a sensory stimulus is encoded in a given population. However, such measures are challenging for two reasons: First, they must take into account noise correlations which can have a large influence on reliability. Second, they need to be as efficient as possible, since the number of trials available in a set of neural recording is usually limited by experimental constraints. Traditionally, cross-validated decoding has been used as a reliability measure, but it only provides a lower bound on reliability and underestimates reliability substantially in small datasets. We show that, if the number of trials per condition is larger than the number of neurons, there is an alternative, direct estimate of reliability which consistently leads to smaller errors and is much faster to compute. The superior performance of the direct estimator is evident both for simulated data and for neuronal population recordings from macaque primary visual cortex. Furthermore we propose generalizations of the direct estimator which measure changes in stimulus encoding across conditions and the impact of correlations on encoding and decoding, typically denoted by I-shuffle and I-diag respectively.","[Kanitscheider, Ingmar; Coen-Cagli, Ruben; Pouget, Alexandre] Univ Geneva, Dept Basic Neurosci, Geneva, Switzerland; [Kanitscheider, Ingmar] Univ Texas Austin, Ctr Learning & Memory, Austin, TX 78712 USA; [Kanitscheider, Ingmar] Univ Texas Austin, Dept Neurosci, Austin, TX 78712 USA; [Kohn, Adam] Albert Einstein Coll Med, Dominick Purpura Dept Neurosci, Bronx, NY 10467 USA; [Kohn, Adam] Albert Einstein Coll Med, Dept Ophthalmol & Visual Sci, Bronx, NY 10467 USA; [Pouget, Alexandre] Univ Rochester, Dept Brain & Cognit Sci, Rochester, NY USA; [Pouget, Alexandre] Gatsby Computat Neurosci Unit, London, England","Kanitscheider, I (reprint author), Univ Geneva, Dept Basic Neurosci, Geneva, Switzerland.",ruben.coencagli@unige.ch,"Kanitscheider, Ingmar/C-6213-2018","Kanitscheider, Ingmar/0000-0002-6144-9659; Coen-Cagli, Ruben/0000-0003-2052-5894","Swiss National Science Foundation [31003A 143707, PAIBA3-145045]; Simons Foundation; NIH [EY016774]","AP was supported by a grant from the Swiss National Science Foundation (31003A 143707) and a grant from the Simons Foundation.

Models of chromosome organization in the yeast nucleus obtained from genome-wide chromosome conformation data or biophysical simulations provide important insights into the average behavior but fail to reveal features from dynamic or transient events that are only visible in a fraction of cells at any given moment. We developed a method to determine chromosome conformation from relative positions of three fluorescently tagged DNA in living cells imaged in 3D. Cell type specific chromosome folding properties could be assigned based on positional combinations between three loci on yeast chromosome 3. We determined that the shorter left arm of chromosome 3 is extended in MATa cells, but can be crumpled in MATa cells. Furthermore, we implemented a new mathematical model that provides for the first time an estimate of the relative physical constraint of three linked loci related to cellular identity. Variations in this estimate allowed us to predict functional consequences from chromatin structural alterations in asf1 and recombination enhancer deletion mutant cells.

Understanding these dynamic events is critical for understanding pathogenic mechanisms and development of effective treatment. Currently, there is a lack of computational methods that enable analysis of multiple gene networks, each of which exhibits differential activity compared to the network of the baseline/healthy condition. We describe the iMDM algorithm to identify both unique and shared gene modules across multiple differential co-expression networks, termed M-DMs (multiple differential modules). We applied iMDM to a time-course RNA-Seq dataset generated using a murine heart failure model generated on two genotypes. We showed that iMDM achieves higher accuracy in inferring gene modules compared to using single or multiple co-expression networks. We found that condition-specific M-DMs exhibit differential activities, mediate different biological processes, and are enriched for genes with known cardiovascular phenotypes. By analyzing M-DMs that are present in multiple conditions, we revealed dynamic changes in pathway activity and connectivity across heart failure conditions. We further showed that module dynamics were correlated with the dynamics of disease phenotypes during the development of heart failure. Thus, pathway dynamics is a powerful measure for understanding pathogenesis. iMDM provides a principled way to dissect the dynamics of gene pathways and its relationship to the dynamics of disease phenotype. With the exponential growth of omics data, our method can aid in generating systems-level insights into disease progression.","[Ma, Xiaoke; Gao, Peng; Tan, Kai] Univ Iowa, Dept Internal Med, Iowa City, IA 52242 USA; [Gao, Long] Univ Iowa, Dept Biomed Engn, Iowa City, IA 52242 USA; [Karamanlidis, Georgios; Lee, Chi Fung; Garcia-Menendez, Lorena; Tian, Rong] Univ Washington, Sch Med, Dept Anesthesiol & Pain Med, Mitochondria & Metab Ctr, Seattle, WA USA","Ma, XK (reprint author), Univ Iowa, Dept Internal Med, Iowa City, IA 52242 USA.",kai-tan@uiowa.edu,,"Lee, Chi Fung/0000-0002-5395-6925; Tian, Rong/0000-0002-3676-3830; Gao, Long/0000-0002-2631-6914","National Institutes of Health [GM108716, HL110349]","This work was supported by National Institutes of Health grants GM108716 to KT and HL110349 to RT.

It has long been recognized that both the user and decoding system can adapt to increase the accuracy of the end effector. Co-adaptation is the process whereby a user learns to control the system in conjunction with the decoder adapting to learn the user's neural patterns. We provide a mathematical framework for co-adaptation and relate co-adaptation to the joint optimization of the user's control scheme (""encoding model"") and the decoding algorithm's parameters. When the assumptions of that framework are respected, co-adaptation cannot yield better performance than that obtainable by an optimal initial choice of fixed decoder, coupled with optimal user learning. For a specific case, we provide numerical methods to obtain such an optimized decoder. We demonstrate our approach in a model brain-computer interface system using an online prosthesis simulator, a simple human-in-the-loop pyschophysics setup which provides a non-invasive simulation of the BCI setting.

Usually, their DNA-binding cooperativity originates from either direct interactions or DNA-mediated allostery. Here, we performed unbiased molecular simulations followed by simulations of protein-DNA unbinding and free energy profiling to study the cooperative DNA recognition by OCT4 and SOX2, key components of enhanceosomes in pluripotent cells. We found that SOX2 influences the orientation and dynamics of the DNA-bound configuration of OCT4. In addition SOX2 modifies the unbinding free energy profiles of both DNA-binding domains of OCT4, the POU specific and POU homeodomain, despite interacting directly only with the first. Thus, we demonstrate that the OCT4-SOX2 cooperativity is modulated by an interplay between protein-protein interactions and DNA-mediated allostery. Further, we estimated the change in OCT4-DNA binding free energy due to the cooperativity with SOX2, observed a good agreement with experimental measurements, and found that SOX2 affects the relative DNA-binding strength of the two OCT4 domains. Based on these findings, we propose that available interaction partners in different biological contexts modulate the DNA exploration routes of multi-domain transcription factors such as OCT4. We consider the OCT4-SOX2 cooperativity as a paradigm of how specificity of transcriptional regulation is achieved through concerted modulation of protein-DNA recognition by different types of interactions.","[Merino, Felipe; Cojocaru, Vlad] Max Planck Inst Mol Biomed, Dept Cell & Dev Biol, Computat Struct Biol Grp, D-48149 Munster, Germany; [Merino, Felipe; Cojocaru, Vlad] Univ Munster, Ctr Multiscale Theory & Computat, D-48149 Munster, Germany; [Bouvier, Benjamin] Univ Lyon 1, CNRS, UMR5086,IBCP, Bioinformat Struct & Interact Bases Mol & Struct, F-69365 Lyon, France","Merino, F (reprint author), Max Planck Inst Mol Biomed, Dept Cell & Dev Biol, Computat Struct Biol Grp, D-48149 Munster, Germany.",vlad.cojocaru@mpi-muenster.mpg.de,"Merino, Felipe/D-2740-2013","Merino, Felipe/0000-0003-4166-8747","Max Planck Society (MPG); German Research Foundation (DFG) through the priority program ""Pluripotency and Cellular Reprogramming"" [SPP1356, CO 975/1-1]; Agence Nationale de la Recherche (CHROME project) [ANR-12 BSV5-0017-01]","FM and VC are financially supported by the Max Planck Society (MPG) and the German Research Foundation (DFG) through the priority program ""SPP1356-Pluripotency and Cellular Reprogramming"" (grant number CO 975/1-1).

However, many classical models reduce the learning process to the updating of parameter estimates and neglect the fact that learning is also frequently accompanied by a variable ""feeling of knowing"" or confidence. The characteristics and the origin of these subjective confidence estimates thus remain largely unknown. Here we investigate whether, during learning, humans not only infer a model of their environment, but also derive an accurate sense of confidence from their inferences. In our experiment, humans estimated the transition probabilities between two visual or auditory stimuli in a changing environment, and reported their mean estimate and their confidence in this report. To formalize the link between both kinds of estimate and assess their accuracy in comparison to a normative reference, we derive the optimal inference strategy for our task. Our results indicate that subjects accurately track the likelihood that their inferences are correct. Learning and estimating confidence in what has been learned appear to be two intimately related abilities, suggesting that they arise from a single inference process. We show that human performance matches several properties of the optimal probabilistic inference. In particular, subjective confidence is impacted by environmental uncertainty, both at the first level (uncertainty in stimulus occurrence given the inferred stochastic characteristics) and at the second level (uncertainty due to unexpected changes in these stochastic characteristics). Confidence also increases appropriately with the number of observations within stable periods. Our results support the idea that humans possess a quantitative sense of confidence in their inferences about abstract non-sensory parameters of the environment. This ability cannot be reduced to simple heuristics; it seems instead a core property of the learning process.","[Meyniel, Florent; Schlunegger, Daniel; Dehaene, Stanislas] INSERM, U992, Cognit Neuroimaging Unit, Gif Sur Yvette, France; [Meyniel, Florent; Schlunegger, Daniel; Dehaene, Stanislas] CEA, DSV I2BM, NeuroSpin Ctr, Gif Sur Yvette, France; [Dehaene, Stanislas] Coll France, F-75231 Paris, France","Meyniel, F (reprint author), INSERM, U992, Cognit Neuroimaging Unit, Gif Sur Yvette, France.",florent.meyniel@gmail.com,,"Meyniel, Florent/0000-0002-6992-678X","INSERM, CEA, College de France, Universite Paris Sud; European Union [604102]","This work was supported by INSERM, CEA, College de France, Universite Paris Sud.

Both in signaling networks and gene regulation there are two main mechanisms by which the concentration can be encoded internally: amplitude modulation (AM), where the absolute concentration of an internal signaling molecule encodes the stimulus, and frequency modulation (FM), where the period between successive bursts represents the stimulus. Although both mechanisms have been observed in biological systems, the question of when it is beneficial for cells to use either AM or FM is largely unanswered. Here, we first consider a simple model for a single receptor (or ion channel), which can either signal continuously whenever a ligand is bound, or produce a burst in signaling molecule upon receptor binding. We find that bursty signaling is more accurate than continuous signaling only for sufficiently fast dynamics. This suggests that modulation based on bursts may be more common in signaling networks than in gene regulation. We then extend our model to multiple receptors, where continuous and bursty signaling are equivalent to AM and FM respectively, finding that AM is always more accurate. This implies that the reason some cells use FM is related to factors other than accuracy, such as the ability to coordinate expression of multiple genes or to implement threshold crossing mechanisms.","[Micali, Gabriele; Aquino, Gerardo; Richards, David M.; Endres, Robert G.] Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Dept Life Sci, London, England; [Micali, Gabriele; Aquino, Gerardo; Richards, David M.; Endres, Robert G.] Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Ctr Integrat Syst Biol & Bioinformat, London, England; [Micali, Gabriele] Univ Milan, Dipartimento Fis, Milan, Italy","Micali, G (reprint author), Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Dept Life Sci, London, England.",r.endres@imperial.ac.uk,"Aquino, Gerardo/G-9924-2018; Aquino, Gerardo/C-5529-2008","Aquino, Gerardo/0000-0003-3228-7520; Aquino, Gerardo/0000-0003-3228-7520; Micali, Gabriele/0000-0001-8463-362X; Richards, David/0000-0001-6255-8761",ERC Starting-Grant [280492-PPHPI]; Leverhulme-Trust [RPG-181]; BBSRC [BB/I019987/1]; Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council [BB/I019987/1],"GM acknowledges funding from ERC Starting-Grant N. 280492-PPHPI.

In a yeast cell undergoing budding, cables are in constant dynamic turnover yet some cables grow from the bud neck toward the back of the mother cell until their length roughly equals the diameter of the mother cell. This raises the question: how is the length of these cables controlled? Here we describe a novel molecular mechanism for cable length control inspired by recent experimental observations in cells. This ""antenna mechanism"" involves three key proteins: formins, which polymerize actin, Smy1 proteins, which bind formins and inhibit actin polymerization, and myosin motors, which deliver Smy1 to formins, leading to a length-dependent actin polymerization rate. We compute the probability distribution of cable lengths as a function of several experimentally tuneable parameters such as the formin-binding affinity of Smy1 and the concentration of myosin motors delivering Smy1. These results provide testable predictions of the antenna mechanism of actin-cable length control.","[Mohapatra, Lishibanya; Kondev, Jane] Brandeis Univ, Dept Phys, Waltham, MA 02254 USA; [Goode, Bruce L.] Brandeis Univ, Dept Biol, Waltham, MA 02254 USA; [Goode, Bruce L.] Brandeis Univ, Rosenstiel Basic Med Sci Res Ctr, Waltham, MA 02254 USA","Mohapatra, L (reprint author), Brandeis Univ, Dept Phys, Waltham, MA 02254 USA.",lishi87@brandeis.edu,,,"Brandeis MRSEC [NSF MRSEC-0820492, MRSEC-142038]; NIH [GM083137]; NSF [DMR-1206146]","This work was supported by Brandeis MRSEC grants NSF MRSEC-0820492 and MRSEC-142038, by an NIH grant (GM083137) to BLG, and an NSF grant (DMR-1206146) to JK.

Posterior probability matching, a variant in which observers match their response probabilities to the posterior probability of each response being correct, is being used increasingly often in models of perception. However, little is known about whether posterior probability matching is consistent with the vast literature on vision and hearing that has developed within signal detection theory. Here we test posterior probability matching models using two tools from detection theory. First, we examine the models' performance in a two-pass experiment, where each block of trials is presented twice, and we measure the proportion of times that the model gives the same response twice to repeated stimuli. We show that at low performance levels, posterior probability matching models give highly inconsistent responses across repeated presentations of identical trials. We find that practised human observers are more consistent across repeated trials than these models predict, and we find some evidence that less practised observers more consistent as well. Second, we compare the performance of posterior probability matching models on a discrimination task to the performance of a theoretical ideal observer that achieves the best possible performance. We find that posterior probability matching is very inefficient at low-to-moderate performance levels, and that human observers can be more efficient than is ever possible according to posterior probability matching models. These findings support classic signal detection models, and rule out a broad class of posterior probability matching models for expert performance on perceptual tasks that range in complexity from contrast discrimination to symmetry detection. However, our findings leave open the possibility that inexperienced observers may show posterior probability matching behaviour, and our methods provide new tools for testing for such a strategy.","[Murray, Richard F.] York Univ, Dept Psychol, Toronto, ON M3J 2R7, Canada; York Univ, Ctr Vis Res, Toronto, ON M3J 2R7, Canada","Murray, RF (reprint author), York Univ, Dept Psychol, Toronto, ON M3J 2R7, Canada.",rfm@yorku.ca,,,Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada [327528-2011]; Canada Foundation for Innovation [12562],"This work was funded by: Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (grant 327528-2011 to RFM), nserc.ca; Canada Foundation for Innovation (grant 12562 to RFM), innovation.ca.

The decrease in new antibiotics' production, combined with increasing frequencies of multi-drug resistant (MDR) bacteria, cause substantial limitations in treatment options for some bacterial infections. To diminish overall resistance, and especially the occurrence of bacteria that are resistant to all antibiotics, certain drugs are deliberately scarcely used-mainly when other options are exhausted. We use a mathematical model to explore the efficiency of such antibiotic restrictions. We assume two commonly used drugs and one restricted drug. The model is examined for the mixing strategy of antibiotic prescription, in which one of the drugs is randomly assigned to each incoming patient. Data obtained from Rabin medical center, Israel, is used to estimate realistic single and double antibiotic resistance frequencies in incoming patients. We find that broad usage of the hitherto restricted drug can reduce the number of incorrectly treated patients, and reduce the spread of bacteria resistant to both common antibiotics. Such double resistant infections are often eventually treated with the restricted drug, and therefore are prone to become resistant to all three antibiotics. Thus, counterintuitively, a broader usage of a formerly restricted drug can sometimes lead to a decrease in the emergence of bacteria resistant to all drugs. We recommend re-examining restriction of specific drugs, when multiple resistance to the relevant alternative drugs already exists.","[Obolski, Uri; Hadany, Lilach] Tel Aviv Univ, Dept Mol Biol & Ecol Plants, IL-69978 Tel Aviv, Israel; [Stein, Gideon Y.] Petah Tikva & Sackler Fac Med, Rabin Med Ctr, Beilinson Hosp, Internal Med B, Tel Aviv, Israel","Obolski, U (reprint author), Tel Aviv Univ, Dept Mol Biol & Ecol Plants, IL-69978 Tel Aviv, Israel.",lhadany@post.tau.ac.il,,,Israeli Science Foundation [1568/13]; Manna Program in Food Safety and Security,"This research has been supported in part by the Israeli Science Foundation 1568/13 (LH), and by a fellowship from the Manna Program in Food Safety and Security (UO).

SGs are hypothesized as a loci of mRNA triage and/or maintenance of proper translation capacity ratio to the pool of mRNAs. In brain ischemia, hippocampal CA3 neurons, which are resilient to ischemia, assemble SGs. In contrast, CA1 neurons, which are vulnerable to ischemia, do not assemble SGs. These results suggest a critical role SG plays in regards to cell fate decisions. Thus SG assembly along with its dynamics should determine the cell fate. However, the process that exactly determines the SG assembly dynamics is largely unknown. In this paper, analyses of experimental data and computer simulations were used to approach this problem. SGs were assembled as a result of applying arsenite to HeLa cells. The number of SGs increased after a short latent period, reached a maximum, then decreased during the application of arsenite. At the same time, the size of SGs grew larger and became localized at the perinuclear region. A minimal mathematical model was constructed, and stochastic simulations were run to test the modeling. Since SGs are discrete entities as there are only several tens of them in a cell, commonly used deterministic simulations could not be employed. The stochastic simulations replicated observed dynamics of SG assembly. In addition, these stochastic simulations predicted a gamma distribution relative to the size of SGs. This same distribution was also found in our experimental data suggesting the existence of multiple fusion steps in the SG assembly. Furthermore, we found that the initial steps in the SG assembly process and microtubules were critical to the dynamics. Thus our experiments and stochastic simulations presented a possible mechanism regulating SG assembly.","[Ohshima, Daisuke; Ichikawa, Kazuhisa] Univ Tokyo, Inst Med Sci, Div Math Oncol, Tokyo, Japan; [Arimoto-Matsuzaki, Kyoko; Tomida, Taichiro] Univ Tokyo, Inst Med Sci, Div Mol Cell Signaling, Tokyo, Japan; [Takekawa, Mutsuhiro] Univ Tokyo, Inst Med Sci, Div Cell Signaling & Mol Med, Tokyo, Japan","Ohshima, D (reprint author), Univ Tokyo, Inst Med Sci, Div Math Oncol, Tokyo, Japan.",kichi@ims.u-tokyo.ac.jp,,"Tomida, Taichiro/0000-0002-1950-4896","Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science","This work was supported by a Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research on Innovative Areas from the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science to KI and MT.

FAAH has been well characterized over the years and, importantly, it represents a promising drug target to treat several diseases, including inflammatory-related diseases and cancer. But its enzymatic mechanism for lipid selection to specifically hydrolyze anandamide, rather than similar bioactive lipids, remains elusive. Here, we clarify this mechanism in FAAH, examining the role of the dynamic paddle, which is formed by the gating residues Phe432 and Trp531 at the boundary between two cavities that form the FAAH catalytic site (the ""membrane-access"" and the ""acyl chain-binding"" pockets). We integrate microsecond-long MD simulations of wild type and double mutant model systems (Phe432Ala and Trp531Ala) of FAAH, embedded in a realistic membrane/water environment, with mutagenesis and kinetic experiments. We comparatively analyze three fatty acid substrates with different hydrolysis rates (anandamide > oleamide > palmitoylethanolamide). Our findings identify FAAH's mechanism to selectively accommodate anandamide into a multi-pocket binding site, and to properly orient the substrate in prereactive conformations for efficient hydrolysis that is interceded by the dynamic paddle. Our findings therefore endorse a structural framework for a lipid selection mechanism mediated by structural flexibility and gating residues between multiple binding cavities, as found in FAAH. Based on the available structural data, this exquisite catalytic strategy for substrate specificity seems to be shared by other lipid-degrading enzymes with similar enzymatic architecture.

Here we address this question by simultaneously recording with large-scale multi-electrode arrays (of up to 128 channels) the activity of cell ensembles (of up to 74 neurons) distributed along all layers of 3-4 neighboring cortical columns in the anesthetized adult rat somatosensory barrel cortex in vivo. Using two different whisker stimulus modalities (location and frequency) we show that individual INH neurons - classified as such according to their distinct extracellular spike waveforms - discriminate better between restricted sets of stimuli (<= 6 stimulus classes) than EXC neurons in granular and infra-granular layers. We also demonstrate that ensembles of INH cells jointly provide as much information about such stimuli as comparable ensembles containing the similar to 20% most informative EXC neurons, however presenting less information redundancy - a result which was consistent when applying both theoretical information measurements and linear discriminant analysis classifiers. These results suggest that a consortium of INH neurons dominates the information conveyed to the neocortical network, thereby efficiently processing incoming sensory activity. This conclusion extends our view on the role of the inhibitory system to orchestrate cortical activity.","[Reyes-Puerta, Vicente; Kim, Suam; Sun, Jyh-Jang; Imbrosci, Barbara; Kilb, Werner; Luhmann, Heiko J.] Johannes Gutenberg Univ Mainz, Inst Physiol, Univ Med Ctr, D-55122 Mainz, Germany","Reyes-Puerta, V (reprint author), Johannes Gutenberg Univ Mainz, Inst Physiol, Univ Med Ctr, D-55122 Mainz, Germany.",reyespue@uni-mainz.de; luhmann@uni-mainz.de,"Luhmann, Heiko J./N-8797-2019; Sun, Jyh-Jang/D-3521-2019","Luhmann, Heiko J./0000-0002-7934-8661; Sun, Jyh-Jang/0000-0002-2326-4864",Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (German Research Foundation),"This work was supported by Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (German Research Foundation) grants to HJL.

Applying multivariate pattern analysis, or ""brain decoding"", methods to magnetoencephalography (MEG) data has allowed researchers to characterize, in high temporal resolution, the emerging representation of object categories that underlie our capacity for rapid recognition. Shortly after stimulus onset, object exemplars cluster by category in a high-dimensional activation space in the brain. In this emerging activation space, the decodability of exemplar category varies over time, reflecting the brain's transformation of visual inputs into coherent category representations. How do these emerging representations relate to categorization behavior? Recently it has been proposed that the distance of an exemplar representation from a categorical boundary in an activation space is critical for perceptual decision-making, and that reaction times should therefore correlate with distance from the boundary. The predictions of this distance hypothesis have been born out in human inferior temporal cortex (IT), an area of the brain crucial for the representation of object categories. When viewed in the context of a time varying neural signal, the optimal time to ""read out"" category information is when category representations in the brain are most decodable. Here, we show that the distance from a decision boundary through activation space, as measured using MEG decoding methods, correlates with reaction times for visual categorization during the period of peak decodability. Our results suggest that the brain begins to read out information about exemplar category at the optimal time for use in choice behaviour, and support the hypothesis that the structure of the representation for objects in the visual system is partially constitutive of the decision process in recognition.","[Ritchie, J.

As synaptic transmission dominates energy consumption, energy can be saved by ensuring that only a few synapses are active. It is therefore likely that the formation of sparse codes and sparse connectivity are fundamental objectives of synaptic plasticity. In this work we study how sparse connectivity can result from a synaptic learning rule of excitatory synapses. Information is maximised when potentiation and depression are balanced according to the mean presynaptic activity level and the resulting fraction of zero-weight synapses is around 50%. However, an imbalance towards depression increases the fraction of zero-weight synapses without significantly affecting performance. We show that imbalanced plasticity corresponds to imposing a regularising constraint on the L-1-norm of the synaptic weight vector, a procedure that is well-known to induce sparseness. Imbalanced plasticity is biophysically plausible and leads to more efficient synaptic configurations than a previously suggested approach that prunes synapses after learning. Our framework gives a novel interpretation to the high fraction of silent synapses found in brain regions like the cerebellum.","[Sacramento, Joao; Wichert, Andreas] Univ Lisbon, INESC ID, Porto Salvo, Portugal; [Sacramento, Joao; Wichert, Andreas] Univ Lisbon, Inst Super Tecn, Porto Salvo, Portugal; [van Rossum, Mark C.

An explanation for this two-stage process was proposed in terms of Hebbian plasticity based on visual experience that would eventually enhance connections between neurons with similar response features. For this to work, however, two conditions must be satisfied: First, orientation selective neuronal responses must exist before specific recurrent synaptic connections can be established. Second, Hebbian learning must be compatible with the recurrent network dynamics contributing to orientation selectivity, and the resulting specific connectivity must remain stable for unspecific background activity. Previous studies have mainly focused on very simple models, where the receptive fields of neurons were essentially determined by feedforward mechanisms, and where the recurrent network was small, lacking the complex recurrent dynamics of large-scale networks of excitatory and inhibitory neurons. Here we studied the emergence of functionally specific connectivity in large-scale recurrent networks with synaptic plasticity. Our results show that balanced random networks, which already exhibit highly selective responses at eye opening, can develop feature-specific connectivity if appropriate rules of synaptic plasticity are invoked within and between excitatory and inhibitory populations. If these conditions are met, the initial orientation selectivity guides the process of Hebbian learning and, as a result, functionally specific and a surplus of bidirectional connections emerge. Our results thus demonstrate the cooperation of synaptic plasticity and recurrent dynamics in large-scale functional networks with realistic receptive fields, highlight the role of inhibition as a critical element in this process, and paves the road for further computational studies of sensory processing in neocortical network models equipped with synaptic plasticity.","[Sadeh, Sadra; Rotter, Stefan] Univ Freiburg, Bernstein Ctr Freiburg, D-79106 Freiburg, Germany; [Sadeh, Sadra; Rotter, Stefan] Univ Freiburg, Fac Biol, D-79106 Freiburg, Germany; [Sadeh, Sadra; Clopath, Claudia] Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Dept Bioengn, London, England","Sadeh, S (reprint author), UCL, Dept Neurosci Physiol & Pharmacol, London, England.",s.sadeh@ucl.ac.uk,,"Sadeh, Sadra/0000-0001-8159-5461",German Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) [BFNT 01GQ0830]; German Research Foundation (DFG) [EXC 1086]; University of Freiburg; Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council [EP/M019780/1],"Funded by the German Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF, grant BFNT 01GQ0830) and the German Research Foundation (DFG, grant EXC 1086).

While there is evidence for a common frontoparietal network underlying both functions and for a key role of dopamine in the modulation of flexible versus stable behavior, the exact neurocomputational mechanisms underlying those executive functions and their adaptation to environmental demands are still unclear. In this work we study the neurocomputational mechanisms underlying cue based task switching (flexibility) and distractor inhibition (stability) in a paradigm specifically designed to probe both functions. We develop a physiologically plausible, explicit model of neural networks that maintain the currently active task rule in working memory and implement the decision process. We simplify the four-choice decision network to a nonlinear drift-diffusion process that we canonically derive from a generic winner-take-all network model. By fitting our model to the behavioral data of individual subjects, we can reproduce their full behavior in terms of decisions and reaction time distributions in baseline as well as distractor inhibition and switch conditions. Furthermore, we predict the individual hemodynamic response timecourse of the rule-representing network and localize it to a frontoparietal network including the inferior frontal junction area and the intraparietal sulcus, using functional magnetic resonance imaging. This refines the understanding of task-switch-related frontoparietal brain activity as reflecting attractor-like working memory representations of task rules. Finally, we estimate the subject-specific stability of the rule-representing attractor states in terms of the minimal action associated with a transition between different rule states in the phase-space of the fitted models. This stability measure correlates with switching-specific thalamocorticostriatal activation, i.e., with a system associated with flexible working memory updating and dopaminergic modulation of cognitive flexibility. These results show that stochastic dynamical systems can implement the basic computations underlying cognitive stability and flexibility and explain neurobiological bases of individual differences.","[Ueltzhoeffer, Kai; Armbruster-Genc, Diana J.

Through intense surveillance, we have collected a unique and highly resolved dataset from the coral reef of Eilat (Israel, Red Sea), that documents the spatiotemporal dynamics of a White Plague Disease (WPD) outbreak over the course of a full season. Based on modern statistical methodologies, we develop a novel spatial epidemiological model that uses a maximum-likelihood procedure to fit the data and assess the transmission pattern of WPD. We link the model to sea surface temperature (SST) and test the possible effect of increasing temperatures on disease dynamics. Our results reveal that the likelihood of a susceptible coral to become infected is governed both by SST and by its spatial location relative to nearby infected corals. The model shows that the magnitude of WPD epidemics strongly depends on demographic circumstances; under one extreme, when recruitment is free-space regulated and coral density remains relatively constant, even an increase of only 0.5 degrees C in SST can cause epidemics to double in magnitude. In reality, however, the spatial nature of transmission can effectively protect the community, restricting the magnitude of annual epidemics. This is because the probability of susceptible corals to become infected is negatively associated with coral density. Based on our findings, we expect that infectious diseases having a significant spatial component, such as Red-Sea WPD, will never lead to a complete destruction of the coral community under increased thermal stress. However, this also implies that signs of recovery of local coral communities may be misleading; indicative more of spatial dynamics than true rehabilitation of these communities. In contrast to earlier generic models, our approach captures dynamics of WPD both in space and time, accounting for the highly seasonal nature of annual WPD outbreaks.","[Zvuloni, Assaf] Israel Nat & Pk Author, Elat, Israel; [Zvuloni, Assaf; Loya, Yossi; Stone, Lewi] Tel Aviv Univ, Dept Zool, IL-69978 Tel Aviv, Israel; [Zvuloni, Assaf] H Steinitz Marine Biol Lab, Elat, Israel; [Artzy-Randrup, Yael] Univ Amsterdam, Inst Biodivers & Ecosyst Dynam, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Katriel, Guy] ORT Braude Coll, Dept Math, Karmiel, Israel; [Stone, Lewi] RMIT Univ, Sch Math & Geospatial Sci, Melbourne, Vic, Australia","Zvuloni, A (reprint author), Israel Nat & Pk Author, Elat, Israel.",Zvuloni@npa.org.il; Yael.Artzy@UvA.nl,"Loya, Yossi/N-3060-2019; Loya, Yossi/J-3039-2012","Loya, Yossi/0000-0001-6870-9444; Stone, Lewi/0000-0002-6465-579X",EU-FP7 grant EPIWORK; Israel Science Foundation,"We received support from EU-FP7 grant EPIWORK and the Israel Science Foundation.

Here, we develop and validate a computational model of the binding of soluble and immobilized ligands to VEGF receptor 2 (VEGFR2), the endosomal trafficking of VEGFR2, and site-specific VEGFR2 tyrosine phosphorylation to study differences in induced signaling between these VEGF isoforms. In capturing essential features of VEGFR2 signaling and trafficking, our model suggests that VEGFR2 trafficking parameters are largely consistent across multiple endothelial cell lines. Simulations demonstrate distinct localization of VEGFR2 phosphorylated on Y1175 and Y1214. This is the first model to clearly show that differences in site-specific VEGFR2 activation when stimulated with immobilized VEGF compared to soluble VEGF can be accounted for by altered trafficking of VEGFR2 without an intrinsic difference in receptor activation. The model predicts that Neuropilin-1 can induce differences in the surface-to-internal distribution of VEGFR2. Simulations also show that ligated VEGFR2 and phosphorylated VEGFR2 levels diverge over time following stimulation. Using this model, we identify multiple key levers that alter how VEGF binding to VEGFR2 results in different coordinated patterns of multiple downstream signaling pathways. Specifically, simulations predict that VEGF immobilization, interactions with Neuropilin-1, perturbations of VEGFR2 trafficking, and changes in expression or activity of phosphatases acting on VEGFR2 all affect the magnitude, duration, and relative strength of VEGFR2 phosphorylation on tyrosines 1175 and 1214, and they do so predictably within our single consistent model framework.","[Clegg, Lindsay Wendel; Mac Gabhann, Feilim] Johns Hopkins Univ, Inst Computat Med, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA; [Clegg, Lindsay Wendel; Mac Gabhann, Feilim] Johns Hopkins Univ, Dept Biomed Engn, Baltimore, MD USA; [Mac Gabhann, Feilim] Johns Hopkins Univ, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA","Clegg, LW (reprint author), Johns Hopkins Univ, Inst Computat Med, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA.",lwendel2@jhmi.edu,"Clegg, Lindsay/D-5945-2014","Clegg, Lindsay/0000-0001-8558-9341","Department of Defense (DoD) National Defense Science & Engineering Graduate Fellowship (NDSEG); NIH [R01HL101200, R00HL093219]; Sloan Research Fellowship","This work was supported by a Department of Defense (DoD) National Defense Science & Engineering Graduate Fellowship (NDSEG) to LWC.

We develop a general model incorporating viral dynamics and pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics to assess how suboptimal adherence affects resistance development and clinical outcomes. We derive design principles and adaptive treatment strategies, identifying a high-risk period when missing doses is particularly risky for de novo resistance, and quantifying the number of additional doses needed to compensate when doses are missed. Using data from large-scale resistance assays, we demonstrate that the risk of resistance can be reduced substantially by applying these principles to a combination therapy of daclatasvir and asunaprevir. By providing a mechanistic framework to link patient characteristics to the risk of resistance, these findings show the potential of rational treatment design.","[Ke, Ruian; Loverdo, Claude; Lloyd-Smith, James O.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Los Angeles, CA USA; [Loverdo, Claude] Univ Paris 06, CNRS, UMR 8237, LJP, Paris, France; [Qi, Hangfei; Sun, Ren] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Mol & Med Pharmacol, Los Angeles, CA USA; [Sun, Ren] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Inst Mol Biol, Los Angeles, CA 90024 USA; [Sun, Ren] Novartis Inst BioMed Res, Dept Infect Dis, Emeryville, CA USA; [Sun, Ren] Zhejiang Univ, Hangzhou 310003, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Lloyd-Smith, James O.] NIH, Fogarty Int Ctr, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA","Ke, RA (reprint author), Los Alamos Natl Lab, Theoret Biol & Biophys T6, MS K710, Los Alamos, NM USA.",rke.work@gmail.com; jlloydsmith@ucla.edu,"Lloyd-Smith, James/K-4080-2012","Lloyd-Smith, James/0000-0001-7941-502X; Loverdo, Claude/0000-0002-0888-1717","National Science Foundation [EF-0928690]; De Logi Chair in Biological Sciences; RAPIDD program of the Science & Technology Directorate, Department of Homeland Security; Fogarty International Center, National Institutes of Health","This work was supported by National Science Foundation (grant number EF-0928690 to JOLS).

ELEGANS; MODEL; POLARITY,"Transformative applications in biomedicine require the discovery of complex regulatory networks that explain the development and regeneration of anatomical structures, and reveal what external signals will trigger desired changes of large-scale pattern. Despite recent advances in bioinformatics, extracting mechanistic pathway models from experimental morphological data is a key open challenge that has resisted automation. The fundamental difficulty of manually predicting emergent behavior of even simple networks has limited the models invented by human scientists to pathway diagrams that show necessary subunit interactions but do not reveal the dynamics that are sufficient for complex, self-regulating pattern to emerge. To finally bridge the gap between high-resolution genetic data and the ability to understand and control patterning, it is critical to develop computational tools to efficiently extract regulatory pathways from the resultant experimental shape phenotypes. For example, planarian regeneration has been studied for over a century, but despite increasing insight into the pathways that control its stem cells, no constructive, mechanistic model has yet been found by human scientists that explains more than one or two key features of its remarkable ability to regenerate its correct anatomical pattern after drastic perturbations. We present a method to infer the molecular products, topology, and spatial and temporal nonlinear dynamics of regulatory networks recapitulating in silico the rich dataset of morphological phenotypes resulting from genetic, surgical, and pharmacological experiments. We demonstrated our approach by inferring complete regulatory networks explaining the outcomes of the main functional regeneration experiments in the planarian literature; By analyzing all the datasets together, our system inferred the first systems-biology comprehensive dynamical model explaining patterning in planarian regeneration. This method provides an automated, highly generalizable framework for identifying the underlying control mechanisms responsible for the dynamic regulation of growth and form.","[Lobo, Daniel; Levin, Michael] Tufts Univ, Dept Biol, Ctr Regenerat & Dev Biol, Medford, MA 02155 USA","Lobo, D (reprint author), Tufts Univ, Dept Biol, Ctr Regenerat & Dev Biol, Medford, MA 02155 USA.",michael.levin@tufts.edu,"Levin, Michael/A-5918-2011","Levin, Michael/0000-0001-7292-8084; Lobo, Daniel/0000-0003-4666-6118","NSF [EF-1124651, OCI-1053575]; NIH [GM078484]; USAMRMC [W81XWH-10-2-0058]; Mathers Foundation; Silicon Mechanics","This work was supported by NSF grant EF-1124651, NIH grant GM078484, USAMRMC grant W81XWH-10-2-0058, and the Mathers Foundation.

While a number of previous experimental studies have observed changes in band 3 distribution after oxidative treatment, the details of how these clusters are formed and how their properties change under different conditions have remained poorly understood. To address these issues, a framework that enables the simultaneous monitoring of the temporal and spatial changes following oxidation is needed. In this study, we established a novel simulation strategy that incorporates deterministic and stochastic reactions with particle reaction-diffusion processes, to model band 3 cluster formation at single molecule resolution. By integrating a kinetic model of RBC antioxidant metabolism with a model of band 3 diffusion, we developed a model that reproduces the time-dependent changes of glutathione and clustered band 3 levels, as well as band 3 distribution during oxidative treatment, observed in prior studies. We predicted that cluster formation is largely dependent on fast reverse reaction rates, strong affinity between clustering molecules, and irreversible hemichrome binding. We further predicted that under repeated oxidative perturbations, clusters tended to progressively grow and shift towards an irreversible state. Application of our model to simulate oxidation in RBCs with cytoskeletal deficiency also suggested that oxidation leads to more enhanced clustering compared to healthy RBCs. Taken together, our model enables the prediction of band 3 spatio-temporal profiles under various situations, thus providing valuable insights to potentially aid understanding mechanisms for removing senescent and premature RBCs.","[Shimo, Hanae; Arjunan, Satya Nanda Vel; Machiyama, Hiroaki; Fujita, Hideaki; Takahashi, Koichi] RIKEN Quantitat Biol Ctr, Lab Biochem Simulat, Osaka, Japan; [Shimo, Hanae; Suematsu, Makoto] Keio Univ, Sch Med, Dept Biochem, Shinjuku Ku, Tokyo, Japan; [Machiyama, Hiroaki; Fujita, Hideaki] Osaka Univ, Immunol Frontier Res Ctr, Osaka, Japan; [Nishino, Taiko; Suematsu, Makoto; Tomita, Masaru; Takahashi, Koichi] Keio Univ, Inst Adv Biosci, Tsuruoka, Yamagata, Japan; [Tomita, Masaru] Keio Univ, Dept Environm & Informat Studies, Fujisawa, Kanagawa, Japan","Shimo, H (reprint author), Univ Cambridge, Dept Biochem, Tennis Court Rd, Cambridge CB2 1QW, England.",ktakahashi@riken.jp,"Fujita, Hideaki/B-7633-2008; Arjunan, Satya/B-3441-2008; Suematsu, Makoto/I-8135-2013","Fujita, Hideaki/0000-0003-3430-5681; Arjunan, Satya/0000-0002-2913-3347; Suematsu, Makoto/0000-0002-7165-6336","Yamagata Prefecture and Tsuruoka City; Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS); JST ERATO, Suematsu Gas Biology Project","This study was supported by research funds from Yamagata Prefecture and Tsuruoka City to Keio University, and by a Grant-in-Aid for Young Scientists of Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) to TN.

Construction of such a signaling pathway network (SPNetwork) can enable identification of novel drug targets and deep understanding of drug action. However, it is challenging to synopsize critical components of these interwoven pathways into one network. To tackle this issue, we developed a novel computational framework, the Drug-specific Signaling Pathway Network (DSPathNet). The DSPathNet amalgamates the prior drug knowledge and drug-induced gene expression via random walk algorithms. Using the drug metformin, we illustrated this framework and obtained one metformin-specific SPNetwork containing 477 nodes and 1,366 edges. To evaluate this network, we performed the gene set enrichment analysis using the disease genes of type 2 diabetes (T2D) and cancer, one T2D genome-wide association study (GWAS) dataset, three cancer GWAS datasets, and one GWAS dataset of cancer patients with T2D on metformin. The results showed that the metformin network was significantly enriched with disease genes for both T2D and cancer, and that the network also included genes that may be associated with metformin-associated cancer survival. Furthermore, from the metformin SPNetwork and common genes to T2D and cancer, we generated a subnetwork to highlight the molecule crosstalk between T2D and cancer. The follow-up network analyses and literature mining revealed that seven genes (CDKN1A, ESR1, MAX, MYC, PPARGC1A, SP1, and STK11) and one novel MYC-centered pathway with CDKN1A, SP1, and STK11 might play important roles in metformin's antidiabetic and anticancer effects. Some results are supported by previous studies. In summary, our study 1) develops a novel framework to construct drug-specific signal transduction networks; 2) provides insights into the molecular mode of metformin; 3) serves a model for exploring signaling pathways to facilitate understanding of drug action, disease pathogenesis, and identification of drug targets.","[Sun, Jingchun; Wu, Yonghui; Xu, Hua] Univ Texas Hlth Sci Ctr Houston, Sch Biomed Informat, Houston, TX 77030 USA; [Sun, Jingchun; Zhao, Min; Jia, Peilin; Denny, Joshua C.; Zhao, Zhongming] Vanderbilt Univ, Sch Med, Dept Biomed Informat, Nashville, TN 37212 USA; [Wang, Lily] Vanderbilt Univ, Sch Med, Dept Biostat, Nashville, TN 37212 USA; [Iverson, Carissa; Aldrich, Melinda C.] Vanderbilt Univ, Sch Med, Dept Thorac Surg, Nashville, TN 37212 USA; [Iverson, Carissa; Aldrich, Melinda C.] Vanderbilt Univ, Ctr Human Genet Res, Nashville, TN 37235 USA; [Zhou, Yubo] Chinese Acad Sci, Shanghai Inst Mat Med, Natl Ctr Drug Screening, Shanghai 200031, Peoples R China; [Bowton, Erica] Vanderbilt Univ, Sch Med, Inst Clin & Translat Res, Nashville, TN 37212 USA; [Roden, Dan M.] Vanderbilt Univ, Sch Med, Dept Med, Nashville, TN 37212 USA; [Roden, Dan M.] Vanderbilt Univ, Sch Med, Dept Pharmacol, Nashville, TN 37212 USA; [Aldrich, Melinda C.] Vanderbilt Univ, Sch Med, Div Epidemiol, Nashville, TN 37212 USA; [Zhao, Zhongming] Vanderbilt Univ, Sch Med, Ctr Quantitat Sci, Nashville, TN 37212 USA; [Zhao, Zhongming] Vanderbilt Univ, Sch Med, Dept Canc Biol, Nashville, TN 37212 USA","Sun, JC (reprint author), Univ Texas Hlth Sci Ctr Houston, Sch Biomed Informat, Houston, TX 77030 USA.",hua.xu@uth.tmc.edu; zhongming.zhao@vanderbilt.edu,"Zhao, Min/J-6588-2019","Zhao, Min/0000-0001-5498-3434; Denny, Josh/0000-0002-3049-7332","National Institutes of Health [R01LM011177, R01LM 010685, K07CA172294, P50CA90949, P50CA095103, P50CA098131, P30CA068485, RC2 GM092618, ULTR000445]; Cancer Prevention & Research Institute of Texas Rising Star Award [CPRIT R1307]; NARSAD Young Investigator Award; American Cancer Society Institutional Research Grant pilot project [IRG-58-009-55]; Ingram Professorship Funds","This project is partially supported by the National Institutes of Health (grant numbers R01LM011177, R01LM 010685, K07CA172294, P50CA90949, P50CA095103, P50CA098131, P30CA068485, RC2 GM092618, ULTR000445), the Cancer Prevention & Research Institute of Texas Rising Star Award (CPRIT R1307), 2013 NARSAD Young Investigator Award, and American Cancer Society Institutional Research Grant pilot project (#IRG-58-009-55) and Ingram Professorship Funds.

However, these experiments are prone to high levels of unexplained technical noise, creating new challenges for identifying genes that show genuine heterogeneous expression within the population of cells under study. BASiCS (Bayesian Analysis of Single-Cell Sequencing data) is an integrated Bayesian hierarchical model where: (i) cell-specific normalisation constants are estimated as part of the model parameters, (ii) technical variability is quantified based on spike-in genes that are artificially introduced to each analysed cell's lysate and (iii) the total variability of the expression counts is decomposed into technical and biological components. BASiCS also provides an intuitive detection criterion for highly (or lowly) variable genes within the population of cells under study. This is formalised by means of tail posterior probabilities associated to high (or low) biological cell-to-cell variance contributions, quantities that can be easily interpreted by users.

With this method, theoretical models of behavior can be lever-aged to find the brain structures underlying variables from specific algorithms, such as prediction errors in reinforcement learning. One potential weakness with this approach is that models often have free parameters and thus the results of the analysis may depend on how these free parameters are set. In this work we asked whether this hypothetical weakness is a problem in practice. We first developed general closed-form expressions for the relationship between results of fMRI analyses using different regressors, e.g., one corresponding to the true process underlying the measured data and one a model-derived approximation of the true generative regressor. Then, as a specific test case, we examined the sensitivity of model-based fMRI to the learning rate parameter in reinforcement learning, both in theory and in two previously-published datasets. We found that even gross errors in the learning rate lead to only minute changes in the neural results. Our findings thus suggest that precise model fitting is not always necessary for model-based fMRI. They also highlight the difficulty in using fMRI data for arbitrating between different models or model parameters. While these specific results pertain only to the effect of learning rate in simple reinforcement learning models, we provide a template for testing for effects of different parameters in other models.","[Wilson, Robert C.] Univ Arizona, Dept Psychol, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA; [Wilson, Robert C.] Univ Arizona, Cognit Sci Program, Tucson, AZ USA; [Niv, Yael] Princeton Univ, Princeton Neurosci Inst, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA","Wilson, RC (reprint author), Univ Arizona, Dept Psychol, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA.",bob@email.arizona.edu,,,National Institute of Health [R01MH098861]; National Institute of Mental Health; National Institute of Drug Abuse [5T32MH065214],"This work was supported by National Institute of Health grant R01MH098861 (http://www.nih.gov/) to YN and National Institute of Mental Health and National Institute of Drug Abuse, training grant 5T32MH065214 (http://www.drugabuse.gov/) to the Princeton Neuroscience Institute.

PU remain a significant burden in cost of care and quality of life despite improved mechanistic understanding and advanced interventions. An agent-based model (ABM) of ischemia/reperfusion-induced inflammation and PU (the PUABM) was created, calibrated to serial images of post-SCI PU, and used to investigate potential treatments in silico. Tissue-level features of the PUABM recapitulated visual patterns of ulcer formation in individuals with SCI. These morphological features, along with simulated cell counts and mediator concentrations, suggested that the influence of inflammatory dynamics caused simulations to be committed to ""better"" vs. ""worse"" outcomes by 4 days of simulated time and prior to ulcer formation. Sensitivity analysis of model parameters suggested that increasing oxygen availability would reduce PU incidence. Using the PUABM, in silico trials of anti-inflammatory treatments such as corticosteroids and a neutralizing antibody targeted at Damage-Associated Molecular Pattern molecules (DAMPs) suggested that, at best, early application at a sufficiently high dose could attenuate local inflammation and reduce pressure-associated tissue damage, but could not reduce PU incidence.

A computational analysis of this network shows that it is not scale-free, and is best approximated by the Watts-Strogatz model, which generates ""small-world"" networks with high clustering and short path lengths. The network is also modular, containing energy level sensing proteins that connect to four output processes: autophagy, fatty acid synthesis, mRNA processing, and MAP kinase signaling. The importance of each protein to network function is dependent on its Katz centrality score, which is related both to the protein's position within a module and to the module's relationship to the network as a whole. The network is also divisible into subnetworks that span modular boundaries and regulate different aspects of fat metabolism. We used a combination of genetics and pharmacology to simultaneously block output from multiple network nodes. The phenotypic results of this blockage define patterns of communication among distant network nodes, and these patterns are consistent with the Watts-Strogatz model.","[Al-Anzi, Bader; Arpp, Patrick; Zinn, Kai] CALTECH, Div Biol & Biol Engn, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA; [Gerges, Sherif] Princeton Univ, Dept Mol Biol, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [Ormerod, Christopher] CALTECH, Div Phys Math & Astron, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA; [Olsman, Noah] CALTECH, Div Engn & Appl Sci, Control & Dynam Syst Opt, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA","Al-Anzi, B (reprint author), CALTECH, Div Biol & Biol Engn, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA.",baderalanzi13@gmail.com; zinnk@caltech.edu,,,National Institutes of Health [NS083874],"This work was funded by a National Institutes of Health R21 grant to KZ, NS083874.

However, the underlying mechanisms of synaptic plasticity are poorly understood. The central controversy is on whether long-term potentiation (LTP) takes a role during sleep and which would be its specific effect on memory. To address this question, we used immunohistochemistry to measure phosphorylation of Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (pCaMKIIa) in the rat hippocampus immediately after specific sleep-wake states were interrupted. Control animals not exposed to novel objects during waking (WK) showed stable pCaMKIIa levels across the sleep-wake cycle, but animals exposed to novel objects showed a decrease during subsequent slow-wave sleep (SWS) followed by a rebound during rapid-eye-movement sleep (REM). The levels of pCaMKIIa during REM were proportional to cortical spindles near SWS/REM transitions. Based on these results, we modeled sleep-dependent LTP on a network of fully connected excitatory neurons fed with spikes recorded from the rat hippocampus across WK, SWS and REM. Sleep without LTP orderly rescaled synaptic weights to a narrow range of intermediate values. In contrast, LTP triggered near the SWS/REM transition led to marked swaps in synaptic weight ranking. To better understand the interaction between rescaling and restructuring during sleep, we implemented synaptic homeostasis and embossing in a detailed hippocampal-cortical model with both excitatory and inhibitory neurons. Synaptic homeostasis was implemented by weakening potentiation and strengthening depression, while synaptic embossing was simulated by evoking LTP on selected synapses. We observed that synaptic homeostasis facilitates controlled synaptic restructuring. The results imply a mechanism for a cognitive synergy between SWS and REM, and suggest that LTP at the SWS/REM transition critically influences the effect of sleep: Its lack determines synaptic homeostasis, its presence causes synaptic restructuring.","[Blanco, Wilfredo; Cota, Vinicius R.; Souza, Annie C.; Renno-Costa, Cesar; Santos, Sharlene; Dias, Gabriella; Tort, Adriano B.

The field of cluster analysis is crowded with diverse methods that make special assumptions about data and address different scientific aims. Despite its shortcomings in accuracy, hierarchical clustering is the dominant clustering method in bioinformatics. Biologists find the trees constructed by hierarchical clustering visually appealing and in tune with their evolutionary perspective. Hierarchical clustering operates on multiple scales simultaneously. This is essential, for instance, in transcriptome data, where one may be interested in making qualitative inferences about how lower-order relationships like gene modules lead to higher-order relationships like pathways or biological processes. The recently developed method of convex clustering preserves the visual appeal of hierarchical clustering while ameliorating its propensity to make false inferences in the presence of outliers and noise. The solution paths generated by convex clustering reveal relationships between clusters that are hidden by static methods such as k-means clustering. The current paper derives and tests a novel proximal distance algorithm for minimizing the objective function of convex clustering. The algorithm separates parameters, accommodates missing data, and supports prior information on relationships. Our program CONVEXCLUSTER incorporating the algorithm is implemented on ATI and nVidia graphics processing units (GPUs) for maximal speed. Several biological examples illustrate the strengths of convex clustering and the ability of the proximal distance algorithm to handle high-dimensional problems.

The goal of this work is to provide insights into the structural changes that characterize the kinetic pathways by which amyloid-beta peptides convert from monomers to oligomers to fibrils. By applying discontinuous molecular dynamics simulations to PRIME20, a force field designed to capture the chemical and physical aspects of protein aggregation, we have been able to trace out the entire aggregation process for a system containing 8 A beta 17-42 peptides. We uncovered two fibrillization mechanisms that govern the structural conversion of A beta 17-42 peptides from disordered oligomers into protofilaments. The first mechanism is monomeric conversion templated by a U-shape oligomeric nucleus into U-shape protofilament. The second mechanism involves a long-lived and on-pathway metastable oligomer with S-shape chains, having a C-terminal turn, en route to the final U-shape protofilament. Oligomers with this C-terminal turn have been regarded in recent experiments as a major contributing element to cell toxicity in Alzheimer's disease. The internal structures of the U-shape protofilaments from our PRIME20/DMD simulation agree well with those from solid state NMR experiments. The approach presented here offers a simple molecular-level framework to describe protein aggregation in general and to visualize the kinetic evolution of a putative toxic element in Alzheimer's disease in particular.","[Cheon, Mookyung; Chang, Iksoo] DGIST, Dept Brain & Cognit Sci, Ctr Proteome Biophys, Daegu, South Korea; [Hall, Carol K.] N Carolina State Univ, Dept Chem & Biomol Engn, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA","Cheon, M (reprint author), DGIST, Dept Brain & Cognit Sci, Ctr Proteome Biophys, Daegu, South Korea.",hall@ncsu.edu; iksoochang@dgist.ac.kr,,,"National Creative Research Initiatives (Center for Proteome Biophysics) of National Research Foundation, Korea [2011-0000041]; National Institutes of Health, USA [GM56766, EB006006]","This work was supported by National Creative Research Initiatives (Center for Proteome Biophysics) of National Research Foundation, Korea (Grant No. 2011-0000041 to MC, IC) and the National Institutes of Health, USA under grant GM56766 and EB006006 (CKH).

One of the ubiquitous principles of sensory systems is the creation of circuits that capitalize on this predictability. Previous work has identified predictable non-uniformities in the distributions of basic visual features in natural images that are relevant to the encoding tasks of the visual system. Here, we report that the well-established statistical distributions of visual features such as visual contrast, spatial scale, and depth - differ between bright and dark image components. Following this analysis, we go on to trace how these differences in natural images translate into different patterns of cortical input that arise from the separate bright (ON) and dark (OFF) pathways originating in the retina. We use models of these early visual pathways to transform natural images into statistical patterns of cortical input. The models include the receptive fields and non-linear response properties of the magnocellular (M) and parvocellular (P) pathways, with their ON and OFF pathway divisions. The results indicate that there are regularities in visual cortical input beyond those that have previously been appreciated from the direct analysis of natural images. In particular, several dark/bright asymmetries provide a potential account for recently discovered asymmetries in how the brain processes visual features, such as violations of classic energy-type models. On the basis of our analysis, we expect that the dark/bright dichotomy in natural images plays a key role in the generation of both cortical and perceptual asymmetries.","[Cooper, Emily A.; Norcia, Anthony M.] Stanford Univ, Dept Psychol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA","Cooper, EA (reprint author), Stanford Univ, Dept Psychol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",emily.a.cooper@dartmouth.edu,,,National Institutes of Health [5R01EY018875-05]; Sony Corporation; Stanford University,"This work was supported by National Institutes of Health Grant 5R01EY018875-05 (AMN) and a research contract between Sony Corporation and Stanford University (AMN).

We propose a computational method called the multistage clonal expansion for EAC (MSCE-EAC) screening model that is used for screening BE patients in silico to evaluate the effects of biopsy sampling, diagnostic sensitivity, and treatment on disease burden. Our framework seamlessly integrates relevant cell-level processes during EAC development with a spatial screening process to provide a clinically relevant model for detecting dysplastic and malignant clones within the crypt-structured BE tissue. With this computational approach, we retain spatio-temporal information about small, unobserved tissue lesions in BE that may remain undetected during biopsy-based screening but could be detected with high-resolution imaging. This allows evaluation of the efficacy and sensitivity of current screening protocols to detect neoplasia (dysplasia and early preclinical EAC) in the esophageal lining. We demonstrate the clinical utility of this model by predicting three important clinical outcomes: (1) the probability that small cancers are missed during biopsy-based screening, (2) the potential gains in neoplasia detection probabilities if screening occurred via high-resolution tomographic imaging, and (3) the efficacy of ablative treatments that result in the curative depletion of metaplastic and neoplastic cell populations in BE in terms of the long-term impact on reducing EAC incidence.","[Curtius, Kit] Univ Washington, Dept Appl Math, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Hazelton, William D.; Luebeck, E.

Here, we reproduce most of the previous results on the 3D genomic organization of the eukaryote Saccharomyces cerevisiae using analysis of 3D reconstructions. We show that many of these results can be reproduced in sparse reconstructions, generated from a small fraction of the experimental data (5% of the data), and study the properties of such models. Finally, we propose for the first time a novel approach for improving the accuracy of 3D reconstructions by introducing additional predicted physical interactions to the model, based on orthologous interactions in an evolutionary-related organism and based on predicted functional interactions between genes.

Molecules involved in the communication are potential drug targets. To identify them systematically, we applied a systems level analysis that combined reverse network engineering with causal effect estimation. Using only observational transcriptome profiles we searched for paracrine factors sending messages from activated hepatic stellate cells (HSC) to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells. We condensed these messages to predict ten proteins that, acting in concert, cause the majority of the gene expression changes observed in HCC cells. Among the 10 paracrine factors were both known and unknown cancer promoting stromal factors, the former including Placental Growth Factor (PGF) and Periostin (POSTN), while Pregnancy-Associated Plasma Protein A (PAPPA) was among the latter. Further support for the predicted effect of PAPPA on HCC cells came from both in vitro studies that showed PAPPA to contribute to the activation of NF kappa B signaling, and clinical data, which linked higher expression levels of PAPPA to advanced stage HCC. In summary, this study demonstrates the potential of causal modeling in combination with a condensation step borrowed from gene set analysis [Model-based Gene Set Analysis (MGSA)] in the identification of stromal signaling molecules influencing the cancer phenotype.","[Engelmann, Julia C.; Spang, Rainer] Univ Regensburg, Dept Stat Bioinformat, D-93053 Regensburg, Germany; [Amann, Thomas; Ott-Roetzer, Birgitta; Nuetzel, Margit; Teufel, Andreas; Hellerbrand, Claus] Univ Hosp Regensburg, Dept Internal Med 1, Regensburg, Germany; [Reinders, Yvonne; Reinders, Joerg; Oefner, Peter J.] Univ Regensburg, Inst Funct Genom, D-93053 Regensburg, Germany; [Thasler, Wolfgang E.] Hosp Ludwig Maximilians Univ Munich, Biobank Author Human Tissue & Cell Res HTCR, Munich, Germany; [Thasler, Wolfgang E.] Hosp Ludwig Maximilians Univ Munich, Ctr Liver Cell Res, Dept Gen Visceral Transplantat Vasc & Thorac Surg, Munich, Germany; [Kristl, Theresa; Huber, Christian G.] Salzburg Univ, Dept Mol Biol, Div Chem & Bioanalyt, A-5020 Salzburg, Austria","Engelmann, JC (reprint author), Univ Regensburg, Dept Stat Bioinformat, D-93053 Regensburg, Germany.",julia.engelmann@ukr.de; rainer.spang@ukr.de; claus.hellerbrand@ukr.de,"Oefner, Peter/K-1116-2016; Huber, Christian G.

Recently developed experimental methods allow the estimation of the CTL's efficacy in detecting and clearing infected host cells. One method, the in vivo killing assay, utilizes the adoptive transfer of antigen displaying target cells into the bloodstream of mice. Surprisingly, killing efficacies measured by this method are often much higher than estimates obtained by other methods based on, for instance, the dynamics of escape mutations. In this study, we investigated what fraction of this variation can be explained by differences in peptide loads employed in in vivo killing assays. We addressed this question in mice immunized with lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV). We conducted in vivo killing assays varying the loads of the immunodominant epitope GP33 on target cells. Using a mathematical model, we determined the efficacy of effector and memory CTL, as well as CTL in chronically infected mice. We found that the killing efficacy is substantially reduced at lower peptide loads. For physiological peptide loads, our analysis predicts more than a factor 10 lower CTL efficacies than at maximum peptide loads. Assuming that the efficacy scales linearly with the frequency of CTL, a clear hierarchy emerges among the groups across all peptide antigen concentrations. The group of mice with chronic LCMV infections shows a consistently higher killing efficacy per CTL than the acutely infected mouse group, which in turn has a consistently larger efficacy than the memory mouse group. We conclude that CTL killing efficacy dependence on surface epitope frequencies can only partially explain the variation in in vivo killing efficacy estimates across experimental methods and viral systems, which vary about four orders of magnitude. In contrast, peptide load differences can explain at most two orders of magnitude.","[Garcia, Victor; Regoes, Roland R.] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Inst Integrat Biol, Zurich, Switzerland; [Richter, Kirsten; Oxenius, Annette] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Inst Microbiol, Zurich, Switzerland; [Graw, Frederik] Heidelberg Univ, Ctr Modeling & Simulat Biosci, Bioquant Ctr, Heidelberg, Germany","Garcia, V (reprint author), Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Inst Integrat Biol, Univ Str, Zurich, Switzerland.",victor.garcia@env.ethz.ch; roland.regoes@env.ethz.ch,"Garcia, Victor/H-4403-2019; Regoes, Roland/A-6538-2008","Regoes, Roland/0000-0001-8319-5293","Swiss National Science Foundation [315230-130855, 310030-146140]; Center for Modeling and Simulation in the Biosciences (BIOMS); ETH Zurich; Promedica Foundation","VG and RRR gratefully acknowledge the funding of the Swiss National Science Foundation, grant number 315230-130855.

Although local populations might undergo extinction, a metapopulation may still be viable as long as patches of suitable habitat are connected by dispersal, so that empty patches can be recolonized. Thus far, metapopulations models have either taken a mean-field approach, or have modeled empirically-based, realistic landscapes. Here we show that an intermediate level of complexity between these two extremes is to consider random landscapes, in which the patches of suitable habitat are randomly arranged in an area (or volume). Using methods borrowed from the mathematics of Random Geometric Graphs and Euclidean Random Matrices, we derive a simple, analytic criterion for the persistence of the metapopulation in random fragmented landscapes. Our results show how the density of patches, the variability in their value, the shape of the dispersal kernel, and the dimensionality of the landscape all contribute to determining the fate of the metapopulation. Using this framework, we derive sufficient conditions for the population to be spatially localized, such that spatially confined clusters of patches act as a source of dispersal for the whole landscape. Finally, we show that a regular arrangement of the patches is always detrimental for persistence, compared to the random arrangement of the patches. Given the strong parallel between metapopulation models and contact processes, our results are also applicable to models of disease spread on spatial networks.","[Grilli, Jacopo] Univ Padua, Dept Phys & Astron G Galilei, Padua, Italy; [Barabas, Gyoergy; Allesina, Stefano] Univ Chicago, Dept Ecol & Evolut, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Allesina, Stefano] Univ Chicago, Computat Inst, Chicago, IL 60637 USA","Grilli, J (reprint author), Univ Padua, Dept Phys & Astron G Galilei, Padua, Italy.",sallesina@uchicago.edu,"Grilli, Jacopo/J-1920-2012","Grilli, Jacopo/0000-0002-8235-5803; Allesina, Stefano/0000-0003-0313-8374",Gini Foundation; NSF [1148867],"JG is supported by Gini Foundation (www.unipd.it).

A computational model can quantify artifact parameters for correction by simulating the currents only if their exact anatomical location is known. We propose that the same artifacts that confound current recordings can help pinpoint the source of those currents by providing a signature of the neuron's morphology. This method can improve the recording quality of currents initiated at the spike initiation zone (SIZ) that are often distal to the soma in invertebrate neurons. Drosophila being a valuable tool for characterizing ion currents, we estimated the SIZ location and quantified artifacts in an identified motoneuron, aCC/MN1-Ib, by constructing a novel multi-compartmental model. Initial simulation of the measured biophysical channel properties in an isopotential Hodgkin-Huxley type neuron model partially replicated firing characteristics. Adding a second distal compartment, which contained spike-generating Na+ and K+ currents, was sufficient to simulate aCC's in vivo activity signature. Matching this signature using a reconstructed morphology predicted that the SIZ is on aCC's primary axon, 70 mu m after the most distal dendritic branching point. From SIZ to soma, we observed and quantified selective morphological filtering of fast activating currents. Non-inactivating K+ currents are filtered similar to 3 times less and despite their large magnitude at the soma they could be as distal as Na+ currents. The peak of transient component (NaT) of the voltage-activated Na+ current is also filtered more than the magnitude of slower persistent component (NaP), which can contribute to seizures. The corrected NaP/NaT ratio explains the previously observed discrepancy when the same channel is expressed in different cells. In summary, we used an in vivo signature to estimate ion channel location and recording artifacts, which can be applied to other neurons.","[Guenay, Cengiz; Sieling, Fred H.; Dharmar, Logesh; Prinz, Astrid A.] Emory Univ, Dept Biol, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA; [Sieling, Fred H.] Georgia Inst Technol, Dept Biomed Engn, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA; [Sieling, Fred H.] Emory Univ, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA; [Lin, Wei-Hsiang; Wolfram, Verena; Marley, Richard; Baines, Richard A.] Univ Manchester, Fac Life Sci, Manchester, Lancs, England","Gunay, C (reprint author), Emory Univ, Dept Biol, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA.",cgunay@emory.edu,"Gunay, Cengiz/A-5420-2011; Gunay, Cengiz/A-8263-2009","Gunay, Cengiz/0000-0001-7586-571X; Gunay, Cengiz/0000-0001-7586-571X",Epilepsy Foundation; Burroughs Wellcome Fund; Wellcome Trust [090798],"This work was supported by awarding of an Epilepsy Foundation (http://www.epilepsy.com/) Post-Doctoral Research Training Fellowship to CG, a Burroughs Wellcome Fund (http://www.bwfund.org/) Career Award to AAP, and funding from the Wellcome Trust (http://www.wellcome.ac.uk/) (090798) to RAB.

To explore the distribution and significance of electrical coupling, we modelled a well analysed, small population of brain-stem neurons which drive swimming in young frog tadpoles. A passive network of 30 multi-compartmental neurons with unmyelinated axons was used to infer that: axon-axon gap junctions close to the soma gave the best match to experimentally measured coupling coefficients; axon diameter had a strong influence on coupling; most neurons were coupled indirectly via the axons of other neurons. When active channels were added, gap junctions could make action potential propagation along the thin axons unreliable. Increased sodium and decreased potassium channel densities in the initial axon segment improved action potential propagation. Modelling suggested that the single spike firing to step current injection observed in whole-cell recordings is not a cellular property but a dynamic consequence of shunting resulting from electrical coupling. Without electrical coupling, firing of the population during depolarising current was unsynchronised; with coupling, the population showed synchronous recruitment and rhythmic firing. When activated instead by increasing levels of modelled sensory pathway input, the population without electrical coupling was recruited incrementally to unpatterned activity. However, when coupled, the population was recruited all-or-none at threshold into a rhythmic swimming pattern: the tadpole ""decided"" to swim. Modelling emphasises uncertainties about fine unmyelinated axon physiology but, when informed by biological data, makes general predictions about gap junctions: locations close to the soma; relatively small numbers; many indirect connections between neurons; cause of action potential propagation failure in fine axons; misleading alteration of intrinsic firing properties. Modelling also indicates that electrical coupling within a population can synchronize recruitment of neurons and their pacemaker firing during rhythmic activity.","[Hull, Michael J.; Willshaw, David J.] Univ Edinburgh, Inst Adapt & Neural Computat, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland; [Hull, Michael J.; Soffe, Stephen R.; Roberts, Alan] Univ Bristol, Sch Biol Sci, Bristol, Avon, England","Hull, MJ (reprint author), Univ Edinburgh, Inst Adapt & Neural Computat, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland.",a.roberts@bristol.ac.uk,,,Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC); Medical Research Council (MRC); Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC); Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council [BB/L002353/1],"The work was carried out as part of the PhD of Michael J.

We organized the Dialogue for Reverse Engineering Assessments and Methods (DREAM) 8 Whole-Cell Parameter Estimation Challenge to develop new parameter estimation algorithms for whole-cell models. We asked participants to identify a subset of parameters of a whole-cell model given the model's structure and in silico ""experimental"" data.

At a large model synapse, the calyx of Held, transmitter release is controlled by several Ca2+ channels in a ""domain overlap"" mode, at least in young animals. To study the geometrical constraints of Ca2+ channel placement in domain overlap control of release, we used stochastic MCell modelling, at active zones for which the position of docked vesicles was derived from electron microscopy (EM). We found that random placement of Ca2+ channels was unable to produce high slope values between release and presynaptic Ca2+ entry, a hallmark of domain overlap, and yielded excessively large release probabilities. The simple assumption that Ca2+ channels can be located anywhere at active zones, except below a critical distance of similar to 30 nm away from docked vesicles (""exclusion zone""), rescued high slope values and low release probabilities. Alternatively, high slope values can also be obtained by placing all Ca2+ channels into a single supercluster, which however results in significantly higher heterogeneity of release probabilities. We also show experimentally that high slope values, and the sensitivity to the slow Ca2+ chelator EGTA-AM, are maintained with developmental maturation of the calyx synapse. Taken together, domain overlap control of release represents a highly organized active zone architecture in which Ca2+ channels must obey a certain distance to docked vesicles. Furthermore, domain overlap can be employed by near-mature, fast-releasing synapses.","[Keller, Daniel; Markram, Henry; Schuermann, Felix] Ecole Polytech Fed Lausanne, Blue Brain Project, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland; [Babai, Norbert; Kochubey, Olexiy; Han, Yunyun; Schneggenburger, Ralf] Ecole Polytech Fed Lausanne, Lab Synapt Mech, Brain Mind Inst, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland","Keller, D (reprint author), Ecole Polytech Fed Lausanne, Blue Brain Project, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland.",ralf.schneggenburger@epfl.ch,"Han, Yunyun/O-2092-2013","Han, Yunyun/0000-0003-2336-167X; Kochubey, Olexiy/0000-0002-8115-7733",Swiss National Science Foundation (SNF) [31003A_138320/1]; Swiss Federal Funding; Canton of Geneva; Canton of Vaud; Hans Wilsdorf Foundation; Louis-Jeantet Foundation; University of Geneva; University of Lausanne; Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne,"This research was supported by a grant from the Swiss National Science Foundation (SNF; 31003A_138320/1; to RS), and Swiss Federal Funding to the Blue Brain Project.

In many eudicot plants, the primordia of sepals and petals (the floral organs) first arise sequentially at the edge of a circular, undifferentiated region called the floral meristem, and later transition into a concentric arrangement called a whorl, which includes four or five organs. The properties controlling the transition to whorls comprising particular numbers of organs is little explored. We propose a development-based model of floral organ-number determination, improving upon earlier models of plant phyllotaxis that assumed two developmental processes: the sequential initiation of primordia in the least crowded space around the meristem and the constant growth of the tip of the stem. By introducing mutual repulsion among primordia into the growth process, we numerically and analytically show that the whorled arrangement emerges spontaneously from the sequential initiation of primordia. Moreover, by allowing the strength of the inhibition exerted by each primordium to decrease as the primordium ages, we show that pentamerous whorls, in which the angular and radial positions of the primordia are consistent with those observed in sepal and petal primordia in Silene coeli-rosa, Caryophyllaceae, become the dominant arrangement. The organ number within the outmost whorl, corresponding to the sepals, takes a value of four or five in a much wider parameter space than that in which it takes a value of six or seven. These results suggest that mutual repulsion among primordia during growth and a temporal decrease in the strength of the inhibition during initiation are required for the development of the tetramerous and pentamerous whorls common in eudicots.","[Kitazawa, Miho S.; Fujimoto, Koichi] Osaka Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Toyonaka, Osaka 560, Japan; [Kitazawa, Miho S.] Japan Soc Promot Sci, Tokyo, Japan","Kitazawa, MS (reprint author), Osaka Univ, Ctr Educ Liberal Arts & Sci, Toyonaka, Osaka 560, Japan.",kitazawa@bio.sci.osaka-u.ac.jp; fujimoto@bio.sci.osaka-u.ac.jp,"Fujimoto, Koichi/J-8454-2013","Kitazawa, Miho S./0000-0001-9468-8018; Fujimoto, Koichi/0000-0001-6473-7990",Osaka University; MEXT [26113511],"MSK is a JSPS Research Fellow (24.1243).

For many species, this implies taking actions with delayed consequences. For example, humans may have to decide between foraging for high-calorie but hard-to-get, and low-calorie but easy-to-get food, under threat of starvation. Homeostatic principles prescribe decisions that maximize the probability of sustaining appropriate energy levels across the entire foraging trajectory. Here, predictions from biological principles contrast with predictions from economic decision-making models based on maximizing the utility of the endpoint outcome of a choice. To empirically arbitrate between the predictions of biological and economic models for individual human decision-making, we devised a virtual foraging task in which players chose repeatedly between two foraging environments, lost energy by the passage of time, and gained energy probabilistically according to the statistics of the environment they chose. Reaching zero energy was framed as starvation. We used the mathematics of random walks to derive end-point outcome distributions of the choices. This also furnished equivalent lotteries, presented in a purely economic, casino-like frame, in which starvation corresponded to winning nothing. Bayesian model comparison showed that-in both the foraging and the casino frames-participants' choices depended jointly on the probability of starvation and the expected endpoint value of the outcome, but could not be explained by economic models based on combinations of statistical moments or on rank-dependent utility. This implies that under precisely defined constraints biological principles are better suited to explain human decision-making than economic models based on endpoint utility maximization.","[Korn, Christoph W.; Bach, Dominik R.] Univ Zurich, Dept Psychiat Psychotherapy & Psychosomat, Zurich, Switzerland; [Bach, Dominik R.] UCL, Wellcome Trust Ctr Neuroimaging, London, England","Korn, CW (reprint author), Univ Zurich, Dept Psychiat Psychotherapy & Psychosomat, Zurich, Switzerland.",christoph.korn@uzh.ch,"Bach, Dominik/B-4302-2019","Bach, Dominik/0000-0003-3717-2036; Korn, Christoph/0000-0002-8228-2624",University of Zurich; Wellcome Trust [091593/Z/10/Z],"This work was funded by the University of Zurich.

Multiple regions of these genomes participate in critical steps in the viral replication cycle, and the functions of many RNA elements are dependent on the formation of defined structures. The structures of these elements are still not fully understood, and additional functional elements likely exist that have not been identified. In this work, we compared three full-length HIV-related viral genomes: HIV-1(NL4-3), SIVcpz, and SIVmac (the latter two strains are progenitors for all HIV-1 and HIV-2 strains, respectively). Model-free RNA structure comparisons were performed using whole-genome structure information experimentally derived from nucleotide-resolution SHAPE reactivities. Consensus secondary structures were constructed for strongly correlated regions by taking into account both SHAPE probing structural data and nucleotide covariation information from structure-based alignments.

In addition, we identified multiple previously unannotated structural elements in the HIV-1 genome likely to function in translation, splicing and other replication cycle processes; these are compelling targets for future functional analyses.

We recently demonstrated that limiting nucleation to specific regions was sufficient to obtain actin networks with different organization. To further investigate how spatially constrained actin nucleation determines the emergent actin organization, we performed detailed simulations of the actin filament system using Cytosim. We first calibrated the steric interaction between filaments, by matching, in simulations and experiments, the bundled actin organization observed with a rectangular bar of nucleating factor. We then studied the overall organization of actin filaments generated by more complex pattern geometries used experimentally. We found that the fraction of parallel versus antiparallel bundles is determined by the mechanical properties of actin filament or bundles and the efficiency of nucleation. Thus nucleation geometry, actin filaments local interactions, bundle rigidity, and nucleation efficiency are the key parameters controlling the emergent actin architecture. We finally simulated more complex nucleation patterns and performed the corresponding experiments to confirm the predictive capabilities of the model.","[Letort, Gaelle; Ennomani, Hajer; Thery, Manuel; Blanchoin, Laurent] CNRS CEA UGA, iRTSV, Lab Physiol Cellulaire & Vegetale, Grenoble, France; [Letort, Gaelle] CEA Grenoble, LETI, Lab Imagerie & Syst Acquisit, F-38054 Grenoble, France; [Letort, Gaelle] Univ Grenoble Alpes, Grenoble, France; [Politi, Antonio Z.; Nedelec, Francois] EMBL, Cell Biol & Biophys Unit, Heidelberg, Germany","Letort, G (reprint author), CNRS CEA UGA, iRTSV, Lab Physiol Cellulaire & Vegetale, Grenoble, France.",nedelec@embl.de; Laurent.blanchoin@cea.fr,"Nedelec, Francois/H-3317-2011","Nedelec, Francois/0000-0002-8141-5288; Politi, Antonio/0000-0003-4788-0933; Letort, Gaelle/0000-0002-5866-0322","Agence Nationale de la Recherche [ANR-12-BSV5-0014-02]; European Commission [241548, 258068]; Labex Grenoble Alliance for Integrated Structural Cell Biology; CEA","This work was funded by Agence Nationale de la Recherche Grants ANR-12-BSV5-0014-02; the European Commission Seventh Framework Programme (FP7/2007-2013) under grant agreements no. 241548 and 258068; Labex Grenoble Alliance for Integrated Structural Cell Biology; and CTBU Grant from CEA to Gaelle Letort.

These oscillations are robust to external stresses, and in the case of genotoxic stress (i.e. DNA damage), the circadian clock responds through phase shifting with primarily phase advancements. The effect of DNA damage on the circadian clock and the mechanism through which this effect operates remains to be thoroughly investigated. Here we build an in silico model to examine damage-induced circadian phase shifts by investigating a possible mechanism linking circadian rhythms to metabolism. The proposed model involves two DNA damage response proteins, SIRT1 and PARP1, that are each consumers of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD), a metabolite involved in oxidation-reduction reactions and in ATP synthesis. This model builds on two key findings: 1) that SIRT1 (a protein deacetylase) is involved in both the positive (i.e. transcriptional activation) and negative (i.e. transcriptional repression) arms of the circadian regulation and 2) that PARP1 is a major consumer of NAD during the DNA damage response. In our simulations, we observe that increased PARP1 activity may be able to trigger SIRT1-induced circadian phase advancements by decreasing SIRT1 activity through competition for NAD supplies. We show how this competitive inhibition may operate through protein acetylation in conjunction with phosphorylation, consistent with reported observations. These findings suggest a possible mechanism through which multiple perturbations, each dominant during different points of the circadian cycle, may result in the phase advancement of the circadian clock seen during DNA damage.","[Luna, Augustin; Aladjem, Mirit I.; Kohn, Kurt W.] NCI, Mol Pharmacol Lab, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; [Luna, Augustin] Boston Univ, Dept Bioinformat, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [McFadden, Geoffrey B.] NIST, Appl & Computat Math Div, Gaithersburg, MD 20899 USA","Luna, A (reprint author), NCI, Mol Pharmacol Lab, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA.",augustin@mail.nih.gov,"Aladjem, Mirit/G-2169-2010; McFadden, Geoffrey/A-7920-2008","Aladjem, Mirit/0000-0002-1875-3110; McFadden, Geoffrey/0000-0001-6723-2103","NIH, National Cancer Institute, Center for Cancer Research","This research was supported in part by the Intramural Research Program of the NIH, National Cancer Institute, Center for Cancer Research.

Peaks of their tuning curves are concentrated at lateral position, while their slopes are steepest at the interaural midline, allowing for the maximum localization accuracy in that area. These experimental observations contradict initial assumptions that the auditory space is represented as a topographic cortical map. It has been suggested that a ""panoramic"" code has evolved to match specific demands of the sound localization task. This work provides evidence suggesting that properties of spatial auditory neurons identified experimentally follow from a general design principle-learning a sparse, efficient representation of natural stimuli. Natural binaural sounds were recorded and served as input to a hierarchical sparse-coding model. In the first layer, left and right ear sounds were separately encoded by a population of complex-valued basis functions which separated phase and amplitude. Both parameters are known to carry information relevant for spatial hearing. Monaural input converged in the second layer, which learned a joint representation of amplitude and interaural phase difference. Spatial selectivity of each second-layer unit was measured by exposing the model to natural sound sources recorded at different positions. Obtained tuning curves match well tuning characteristics of neurons in the mammalian auditory cortex. This study connects neuronal coding of the auditory space with natural stimulus statistics and generates new experimental predictions. Moreover, results presented here suggest that cortical regions with seemingly different functions may implement the same computational strategy-efficient coding.","[Mlynarski, Wiktor] Max Planck Inst Math Sci, Leipzig, Germany","Mlynarski, W (reprint author), MIT, Dept Brain & Cognit Sci, E25-618, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",wiktor.mlynarski@gmail.com,,,"German Science Foundation graduate college ""InterNeuro""","This work was funded by the German Science Foundation graduate college ""InterNeuro"".

Coordination between left and right neural activities in the spinal cord controlling left and right legs is provided by commissural interneurons (CINs). Several CIN types have been genetically identified, including the excitatory V3 and excitatory and inhibitory V0 types. Recent studies demonstrated that genetic elimination of all V0 CINs caused switching from a normal left-right alternating activity to a left-right synchronized ""hopping"" pattern. Furthermore, ablation of only the inhibitory V0 CINs (V0(D) subtype) resulted in a lack of left-right alternation at low locomotor frequencies and retaining this alternation at high frequencies, whereas selective ablation of the excitatory V0 neurons (V0(V) subtype) maintained the left-right alternation at low frequencies and switched to a hopping pattern at high frequencies. To analyze these findings, we developed a simplified mathematical model of neural circuits consisting of four pacemaker neurons representing left and right, flexor and extensor rhythm-generating centers interacting via commissural pathways representing V3, V0(D), and V0(V) CINs. The locomotor frequency was controlled by a parameter defining the excitation of neurons and commissural pathways mimicking the effects of N-methyl-D-aspartate on locomotor frequency in isolated rodent spinal cord preparations. The model demonstrated a typical left-right alternating pattern under control conditions, switching to a hopping activity at any frequency after removing both V0 connections, a synchronized pattern at low frequencies with alternation at high frequencies after removing only V0(D) connections, and an alternating pattern at low frequencies with hopping at high frequencies after removing only V0(V) connections. We used bifurcation theory and fast-slow decomposition methods to analyze network behavior in the above regimes and transitions between them. The model reproduced, and suggested explanation for, a series of experimental phenomena and generated predictions available for experimental testing.","[Molkov, Yaroslav I.] Indiana Univ Purdue Univ, Dept Math Sci, Indianapolis, IN 46202 USA; [Bacak, Bartholomew J.; Rybak, Ilya A.] Drexel Univ, Dept Neurobiol & Anat, Coll Med, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Talpalar, Adolfo E.] Karolinska Inst, Dept Neurosci, Stockholm, Sweden","Molkov, YI (reprint author), Indiana Univ Purdue Univ, Dept Math Sci, Indianapolis, IN 46202 USA.",rybak@drexel.edu,"Molkov, Yaroslav/H-3305-2019; Talpalar, Adolfo/H-3996-2019","Molkov, Yaroslav/0000-0002-0862-1974; Talpalar, Adolfo/0000-0001-9056-6021","National Institutes of Health (NIH) [R01NS081713, R01NS090919]","This study was supported by: the National Institutes of Health (NIH) grants R01NS081713 and R01NS090919 (http://www.nih.gov/).

Understanding seizure mechanisms requires identifying the relations between seizure components within and across these scales, together with the analysis of their dynamical repertoire. Mathematical models have been developed to reproduce seizure dynamics across scales ranging from the single neuron to the neural population. In this study, we develop a network model of spiking neurons and systematically investigate the conditions, under which the network displays the emergent dynamic behaviors known from the Epileptor, which is a well-investigated abstract model of epileptic neural activity. This approach allows us to study the biophysical parameters and variables leading to epileptiform discharges at cellular and network levels. Our network model is composed of two neuronal populations, characterized by fast excitatory bursting neurons and regular spiking inhibitory neurons, embedded in a common extracellular environment represented by a slow variable. By systematically analyzing the parameter landscape offered by the simulation framework, we reproduce typical sequences of neural activity observed during status epilepticus. We find that exogenous fluctuations from extracellular environment and electro-tonic couplings play a major role in the progression of the seizure, which supports previous studies and further validates our model. We also investigate the influence of chemical synaptic coupling in the generation of spontaneous seizure-like events. Our results argue towards a temporal shift of typical spike waves with fast discharges as synaptic strengths are varied. We demonstrate that spike waves, including interictal spikes, are generated primarily by inhibitory neurons, whereas fast discharges during the wave part are due to excitatory neurons. Simulated traces are compared with in vivo experimental data from rodents at different stages of the disorder. We draw the conclusion that slow variations of global excitability, due to exogenous fluctuations from extracellular environment, and gap junction communication push the system into paroxysmal regimes. We discuss potential mechanisms underlying such machinery and the relevance of our approach, supporting previous detailed modeling studies and reflecting on the limitations of our methodology.","[Naze, Sebastien; Bernard, Christophe; Jirsa, Viktor] INSERM, UMR1106, Inst Neurosci & Syst, F-13258 Marseille, France; [Naze, Sebastien; Bernard, Christophe; Jirsa, Viktor] Aix Marseille Univ, Marseille, France","Naze, S (reprint author), INSERM, UMR1106, Inst Neurosci & Syst, F-13258 Marseille, France.",sebastien.naze@univ-amu.fr; viktor.jirsa@univ-amu.fr,"Jirsa, Viktor/M-4630-2016; bernard, christophe/S-5937-2016; bernard, christophe/A-4929-2012","Jirsa, Viktor/0000-0002-8251-8860; bernard, christophe/0000-0003-3014-1966; bernard, christophe/0000-0003-3014-1966",FP7-ICT BrainScales; James S.

It has been argued that the CA3 region works as an auto-associative memory and that its recurrent fibers are the actual storing place of the memories. Furthermore, to work properly CA3 requires memory patterns that are mutually uncorrelated. It has been suggested that the dentate gyrus orthogonalizes the patterns before storage, a process known as pattern separation. In this study we review the model when random input patterns are presented for storage and investigate whether it is capable of storing patterns of more realistic entorhinal grid cell input. Surprisingly, we find that an auto-associative CA3 net is redundant for random inputs up to moderate noise levels and is only beneficial at high noise levels. When grid cell input is presented, auto-association is even harmful for memory performance at all levels. Furthermore, we find that Hebbian learning in the dentate gyrus does not support its function as a pattern separator. These findings challenge the standard framework and support an alternative view where the simpler EC-CA1-EC network is sufficient for memory storage.","[Neher, Torsten; Cheng, Sen; Wiskott, Laurenz] Ruhr Univ Bochum, Int Grad Sch Neurosci, Bochum, Germany; [Neher, Torsten; Wiskott, Laurenz] Ruhr Univ Bochum, Inst Neural Computat, Bochum, Germany; [Cheng, Sen] Ruhr Univ Bochum, Dept Psychol, Mercator Res Grp Struct Memory, Bochum, Germany","Neher, T (reprint author), Ruhr Univ Bochum, Int Grad Sch Neurosci, Univ Str 150, Bochum, Germany.",torsten.neher@ini.rub.de,"Cheng, Sen/A-5722-2009; Wiskott, Laurenz/P-7715-2017","Cheng, Sen/0000-0002-6719-8029; Wiskott, Laurenz/0000-0001-6237-740X","German Research Foundation (Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, DFG) [SFB 874]; Stiftung Mercator","This work was partly funded by a grant from the German Research Foundation (Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, DFG) to LW (SFB 874, project B3) and to SC (SFB 874, project B2), and by a grant from the Stiftung Mercator to SC.

This data provides an opportunity for deriving shared and tissue specific gene regulatory networks on the basis of co-expression between genes. However, a small number of samples are available for a majority of the tissues, and therefore statistical inference of networks in this setting is highly underpowered. To address this problem, we infer tissue-specific gene co-expression networks for 35 tissues in the GTEx dataset using a novel algorithm, GNAT, that uses a hierarchy of tissues to share data between related tissues. We show that this transfer learning approach increases the accuracy with which networks are learned. Analysis of these networks reveals that tissue-specific transcription factors are hubs that preferentially connect to genes with tissue specific functions. Additionally, we observe that genes with tissue-specific functions lie at the peripheries of our networks. We identify numerous modules enriched for Gene Ontology functions, and show that modules conserved across tissues are especially likely to have functions common to all tissues, while modules that are upregulated in a particular tissue are often instrumental to tissue-specific function.

When modelling or redesigning such systems, functional subsystems are often analysed independently first, before subsequent integration into larger-scale computational models. In the design and analysis process, it is therefore important to quantitatively analyse and predict the dynamics of the interactions between integrated subsystems; in particular, how the incremental effect of integrating a subsystem into a network depends on the existing dynamics of that network. In this paper we present a framework for simulating the contribution of any given functional subsystem when integrated together with one or more other subsystems. This is achieved through a cascaded layering of a network into functional subsystems, where each layer is defined by an appropriate subset of the reactions. We exploit symmetries in our formulation to exhaustively quantify each subsystem's incremental effects with minimal computational effort. When combining subsystems, their isolated behaviour may be amplified, attenuated, or be subject to more complicated effects. We propose the concept of mutual dynamics to quantify such nonlinear phenomena, thereby defining the incompatibility and cooperativity between all pairs of subsystems when integrated into any larger network. We exemplify our theoretical framework by analysing diverse behaviours in three dynamic models of signalling and metabolic pathways: the effect of crosstalk mechanisms on the dynamics of parallel signal transduction pathways; reciprocal side-effects between several integral feedback mechanisms and the subsystems they stabilise; and consequences of nonlinear interactions between elementary flux modes in glycolysis for metabolic engineering strategies. Our analysis shows that it is not sufficient to just specify subsystems and analyse their pairwise interactions; the environment in which the interaction takes place must also be explicitly defined. Our framework provides a natural representation of nonlinear interaction phenomena, and will therefore be an important tool for modelling large-scale evolved or synthetic biomolecular networks.","[Prescott, Thomas P.; Papachristodoulou, Antonis] Univ Oxford, Dept Engn Sci, Oxford OX1 3PJ, England; [Prescott, Thomas P.] Univ Oxford, Life Sci Interface Doctoral Training Ctr, Oxford OX1 3PJ, England; [Lang, Moritz] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Dept Biosyst Sci & Engn, Basel, Switzerland; [Lang, Moritz] Swiss Inst Bioinformat, Basel, Switzerland","Prescott, TP (reprint author), Univ Oxford, Dept Engn Sci, Parks Rd, Oxford OX1 3PJ, England.",antonis@eng.ox.ac.uk,"Papachristodoulou, Antonis/C-2597-2012","Papachristodoulou, Antonis/0000-0002-3565-8967; Lang, Moritz/0000-0002-9380-8679; Prescott, Thomas Paul/0000-0002-9884-3887","UK Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) [EP/M002454/1, EP/J012041/1, EP/I031944/1, EP/J010537/1]; UK EPSRC [EP/F500394/1]; Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council [984893, EP/I031944/1, EP/M002454/1, EP/J012041/1, EP/J010537/1]","AP is funded through the UK Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC, http://www.epsrc.ac.uk) through projects EP/M002454/1, EP/J012041/1, EP/I031944/1, and EP/J010537/1.

We present SeqGL, a novel de novo motif discovery algorithm to identify multiple TF sequence signals from ChIP-, DNase-, and ATAC-seq profiles. SeqGL trains a discriminative model using a k-mer feature representation together with group lasso regularization to extract a collection of sequence signals that distinguish peak sequences from flanking regions. Benchmarked on over 100 ChIP-seq experiments, SeqGL outperformed traditional motif discovery tools in discriminative accuracy. Furthermore, SeqGL can be naturally used with multitask learning to identify genomic and cell-type context determinants of TF binding. SeqGL successfully scales to the large multiplicity of sequence signals in DNase-or ATAC-seq maps. In particular, SeqGL was able to identify a number of ChIP-seq validated sequence signals that were not found by traditional motif discovery algorithms. Thus compared to widely used motif discovery algorithms, SeqGL demonstrates both greater discriminative accuracy and higher sensitivity for detecting the DNA sequence signals underlying regulatory element maps.

They feature a constriction zone, contributed by the plunging of extracellular loop 3 (L3) into the channel lumen. Porins are generally in the open state, but undergo gating in response to external voltages. To date the underlying mechanism is unclear. Here we report results from molecular dynamics simulations on the two porins of Providenica stuartii, Omp-Pst1 and Omp-Pst2, which display distinct voltage sensitivities. Voltage gating was observed in Omp-Pst2, where the binding of cations in-between L3 and the barrel wall results in exposing a conserved aromatic residue in the channel lumen, thereby halting ion permeation. Comparison of Omp-Pst1 and Omp-Pst2 structures and trajectories suggests that their sensitivity to voltage is encoded in the hydrogen-bonding network anchoring L3 onto the barrel wall, as we observed that it is the strength of this network that governs the probability of cations binding behind L3. That Omp-Pst2 gating is observed only when ions flow against the electrostatic potential gradient of the channel furthermore suggests a possible role for this porin in the regulation of charge distribution across the outer membrane and bacterial homeostasis.","[Song, Wanling; Jiang, Hualiang; Xu, Yechun] Chinese Acad Sci, Shanghai Inst Mat Med, Key Lab Receptor Res, Drug Discovery & Design Ctr, Shanghai 200031, Peoples R China; [Bajaj, Harsha; Winterhalter, Mathias] Jacobs Univ Bremen, Sch Sci & Engn, D-28759 Bremen, Germany; [Nasrallah, Chady; Colletier, Jacques-Philippe] Univ Grenoble Alpes, IBS, Grenoble, France; [Nasrallah, Chady; Colletier, Jacques-Philippe] CNRS, IBS, Grenoble, France; [Nasrallah, Chady; Colletier, Jacques-Philippe] CEA Grenoble, IBS, F-38054 Grenoble, France","Song, WL (reprint author), Chinese Acad Sci, Shanghai Inst Mat Med, Key Lab Receptor Res, Drug Discovery & Design Ctr, Shanghai 200031, Peoples R China.",colletier@ibs.fr; ycxu@simm.ac.cn,,"Winterhalter, Mathias/0000-0002-1604-3318","Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS); CAS-Novo Nordisk Great Wall Professorship; CAS; Prime d' Excellence Scientifique of CNRS; National Natural Science Foundation of China [31150110578, 21172233, 81422047]; National ST Major Project [2012ZX09301001-005]","The ""100 Talents Project"" of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) (to YX); The CAS-Novo Nordisk Great Wall Professorship (to YX); The International Young Researcher fellowship of CAS (to JPC); The Prime d' Excellence Scientifique of CNRS (to JPC); The National Natural Science Foundation of China NO. 31150110578 (to JPC); The National Natural Science Foundation of China NO. 21172233 (to YX); The National Natural Science Foundation of China NO. 81422047 (to YX); National S&T Major Project NO. 2012ZX09301001-005 (to YX); The funders had no role in study design, data collection and analysis, decision to publish, or preparation of the manuscript.",,57,3,3,0,13,PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE,SAN FRANCISCO,"1160 BATTERY STREET, STE 100, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94111 USA",1553-734X,1553-7358,,PLOS COMPUT BIOL,PLoS Comput.

To measure their cell density, bacterial populations produce and detect diffusible molecules called autoinducers. Individual bacteria internally represent the external concentration of autoinducers via the level of monitor proteins. In turn, these monitor proteins typically regulate both their own production and the production of autoinducers, thereby establishing internal and external feedbacks. Here, we ask whether feedbacks can increase the information available to cells about their local density. We quantify available information as the mutual information between the abundance of a monitor protein and the local cell density for biologically relevant models of quorum sensing. Using variational methods, we demonstrate that feedbacks can increase information transmission, allowing bacteria to resolve up to two additional ranges of cell density when compared with bistable quorum-sensing systems.

This dysfunctional process typically involves additional regulatory modulators including DNA methylation. Thus, the interplay between transcription factor (TF) binding and DNA methylation are two components of a cancer regulatory interactome presumed to display correlated signals. As proof of concept, we performed a systematic motif-based in silico analysis to infer all potential TFs that are involved in breast cancer prognosis through an association with DNA methylation changes. Using breast cancer DNA methylation and clinical data derived from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), we carried out a systematic inference of TFs whose misregulation underlie different clinical subtypes of breast cancer. Our analysis identified TFs known to be associated with clinical outcomes of p53 and ER (estrogen receptor) subtypes of breast cancer, while also predicting new TFs that may also be involved. Furthermore, our results suggest that misregulation in breast cancer can be caused by the binding of alternative factors to the binding sites of TFs whose activity has been ablated. Overall, this study provides a comprehensive analysis that links DNA methylation to TF binding to patient prognosis.","[Ung, Matthew H.; Varn, Frederick S.; Lou, Shaoke; Cheng, Chao] Geisel Sch Med Dartmouth, Dept Genet, Hanover, NH 03755 USA; [Cheng, Chao] Geisel Sch Med Dartmouth, Inst Quantitat Biomed Sci, Lebanon, NH USA; [Cheng, Chao] Geisel Sch Med Dartmouth, Norris Cotton Canc Ctr, Lebanon, NH USA","Ung, MH (reprint author), Geisel Sch Med Dartmouth, Dept Genet, Hanover, NH 03755 USA.",chao.cheng@dartmouth.edu,"Lou, Shaoke/P-7615-2018",,American Cancer Society [IRG-82-003-270]; Centers of Biomedical Research Excellence (COBRE) [GM103534]; Geisel School of Medicine at Dartmouth College,"This work was supported by the American Cancer Society Research grant IRG-82-003-270, the Centers of Biomedical Research Excellence (COBRE) grant GM103534, and the start-up funding package provided to CC by the Geisel School of Medicine at Dartmouth College.

One can estimate the relative strength of this hydrophobic effect for each amino acid by mining a large set of experimentally determined protein structures. However, the hydrophobic force is known to be strongly temperature dependent. This temperature dependence is thought to explain the denaturation of proteins at low temperatures. Here we investigate if it is possible to extract this temperature dependence directly from a large set of protein structures determined at different temperatures. Using NMR structures filtered for sequence identity, we were able to extract hydrophobicity propensities for all amino acids at five different temperature ranges (spanning 265-340 K). These propensities show that the hydrophobicity becomes weaker at lower temperatures, in line with current theory. Alternatively, one can conclude that the temperature dependence of the hydrophobic effect has a measurable influence on protein structures. Moreover, this work provides a method for probing the individual temperature dependence of the different amino acid types, which is difficult to obtain by direct experiment.","[van Dijk, Erik; Hoogeveen, Arlo; Abeln, Sanne] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Dept Comp Sci, Ctr Integrat Bioinformat IBIVU, Amsterdam, Netherlands","van Dijk, E (reprint author), Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Dept Comp Sci, Ctr Integrat Bioinformat IBIVU, Amsterdam, Netherlands.",s.abeln@vu.nl,,"Abeln, Sanne/0000-0002-2779-7174",Veni grant on the project 'Understanding toxic protein oligomers through ensemble characteristics' from Netherlands Organisation for Scientic Research (NWO)',"SA has been supported by a Veni grant on the project 'Understanding toxic protein oligomers through ensemble characteristics' from Netherlands Organisation for Scientic Research (NWO)'.

While the log-rank test is widely used for this purpose, nearly all implementations of the log-rank test rely on an asymptotic approximation that is not appropriate in many genomics applications. This is because: the two populations determined by a genetic variant may have very different sizes; and the evaluation of many possible variants demands highly accurate computation of very small p-values. We demonstrate this problem for cancer genomics data where the standard log-rank test leads to many false positive associations between somatic mutations and survival time. We develop and analyze a novel algorithm, Exact Log-rank Test (ExaLT), that accurately computes the p-value of the log-rank statistic under an exact distribution that is appropriate for any size populations. We demonstrate the advantages of ExaLT on data from published cancer genomics studies, finding significant differences from the reported p-values. We analyze somatic mutations in six cancer types from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), finding mutations with known association to survival as well as several novel associations.

Through a branching process model, we describe the relation between the survival times and the four markers mainly involved in metastatic breast cancer (EPCAM, CD47, CD44 and MET). In particular, the model takes into account the gene expression profile of circulating tumour cells to predict personalised survival probability. We also include the administration of drugs as bisphosphonates, which reduce the formation of circulating tumour cells and their survival in the blood vessels, in order to analyse the dynamic changes induced by the therapy. We analyse the effects of circulating tumour cells on the progression of the disease providing a quantitative measure of the cell driver mutations needed for invading the bone tissue.

Recent studies have shown a strong correlation between chromatin interactions and gene co-expression. However, predicting gene co-expression from frequent long-range chromatin interactions remains challenging. We address this by characterizing the topology of the cortical chromatin interaction network using scale-aware topological measures. We demonstrate that based on these characterizations it is possible to accurately predict spatial co-expression between genes in the mouse cortex. Consistent with previous findings, we find that the chromatin interaction profile of a gene-pair is a good predictor of their spatial co-expression. However, the accuracy of the prediction can be substantially improved when chromatin interactions are described using scale-aware topological measures of the multi-resolution chromatin interaction network. We conclude that, for co-expression prediction, it is necessary to take into account different levels of chromatin interactions ranging from direct interaction between genes (i.e. small-scale) to chromatin compartment interactions (i.e. large-scale).","[Babaei, Sepideh; Mahfouz, Ahmed; Hulsman, Marc; de Ridder, Jeroen; Reinders, Marcel] Delft Univ Technol, Delft Bioinformat Lab, Delft, Netherlands; [Mahfouz, Ahmed; Lelieveldt, Boudewijn P.

Experimentally, at pH 7.0 and 10 degrees C, Im7 folds in a three-state manner via an intermediate but Im9 folding is two-state-like. Accordingly, Im7 exhibits a chevron rollover, whereas the chevron arm for Im9 folding is linear. Here we address the biophysical basis of their different behaviors by using native-centric models with and without additional transferrable, sequence-dependent energies. The Im7 chevron rollover is not captured by either a pure native-centric model or a model augmented by nonnative hydrophobic interactions with a uniform strength irrespective of residue type. By contrast, a more realistic nonnative interaction scheme that accounts for the difference in hydrophobicity among residues leads simultaneously to a chevron rollover for Im7 and an essentially linear folding chevron arm for Im9. Hydrophobic residues identified by published experiments to be involved in nonnative interactions during Im7 folding are found to participate in the strongest nonnative contacts in this model. Thus our observations support the experimental perspective that the Im7 folding intermediate is largely underpinned by nonnative interactions involving large hydrophobics. Our simulation suggests further that nonnative effects in Im7 are facilitated by a lower local native contact density relative to that of Im9. In a one-dimensional diffusion picture of Im7 folding with a coordinate-and stability-dependent diffusion coefficient, a significant chevron rollover is consistent with a diffusion coefficient that depends strongly on native stability at the conformational position of the folding intermediate.","[Chen, Tao; Chan, Hue Sun] Univ Toronto, Dept Biochem, Toronto, ON M5S 1A8, Canada; [Chen, Tao; Chan, Hue Sun] Univ Toronto, Dept Mol Genet, Toronto, ON M5S 1A8, Canada; [Chen, Tao; Chan, Hue Sun] Univ Toronto, Dept Phys, Toronto, ON M5S 1A8, Canada","Chen, T (reprint author), Univ Toronto, Dept Biochem, Toronto, ON M5S 1A8, Canada.",chan@arrhenius.med.toronto.edu,,,Canadian Institutes of Health Research [MOP-84281],"The authors received the Canadian Institutes of Health Research Grant No. MOP-84281 (http://www.cihr-irsc.gc.ca/).

DNA damage repair and signalling have been studied and modelled in detail separately, but it is not yet clear how they integrate with one another to control cell fate. In this study, we have created an integrated stochastic model of DNA damage repair by non-homologous end joining and of gamma irradiation-induced cellular senescence in human cells that are not apoptosisprone. The integrated model successfully explains the changes that occur in the dynamics of DNA damage repair after irradiation. Simulations of p53/p21 dynamics after irradiation agree well with previously published experimental studies, further validating the model. Additionally, the model predicts, and we offer some experimental support, that low-dose fractionated irradiation of cells leads to temporal patterns in p53/p21 that lead to significant cellular senescence. The integrated model is valuable for studying the processes of DNA damage induced cell fate and predicting the effectiveness of DNA damage related medical interventions at the cellular level.","[Dolan, David W.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), seasonal influenza affects 5% to 20% of the U.S. population and causes major economic impacts resulting from hospitalization and absenteeism. Understanding influenza dynamics and forecasting its impact is fundamental for developing prevention and mitigation strategies. We combine modern data assimilation methods with Wikipedia access logs and CDC influenza-like illness (ILI) reports to create a weekly forecast for seasonal influenza. The methods are applied to the 2013-2014 influenza season but are sufficiently general to forecast any disease outbreak, given incidence or case count data. We adjust the initialization and parametrization of a disease model and show that this allows us to determine systematic model bias. In addition, we provide a way to determine where the model diverges from observation and evaluate forecast accuracy. Wikipedia article access logs are shown to be highly correlated with historical ILI records and allow for accurate prediction of ILI data several weeks before it becomes available. The results show that prior to the peak of the flu season, our forecasting method produced 50% and 95% credible intervals for the 2013-2014 ILI observations that contained the actual observations for most weeks in the forecast. However, since our model does not account for re-infection or multiple strains of influenza, the tail of the epidemic is not predicted well after the peak of flu season has passed.","[Hickmann, Kyle S.] Los Alamos Natl Lab, Div Theoret, Los Alamos, NM 87544 USA; [Fairchild, Geoffrey; Generous, Nicholas; Deshpande, Alina; Del Valle, Sara Y.] Los Alamos Natl Lab, Def Syst Anal Div, Los Alamos, NM USA; [Priedhorsky, Reid] Los Alamos Natl Lab, High Performance Comp Div, Los Alamos, NM USA; [Hyman, James M.] Tulane Univ, Dept Math, New Orleans, LA 70118 USA","Hickmann, KS (reprint author), Los Alamos Natl Lab, Div Theoret, Los Alamos, NM 87544 USA.",hickmank@lanl.gov,,"deshpande, alina/0000-0003-4541-4410",NIH/NIGMS/MIDAS [U01-GM097658-01]; Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA); Department of Energy [DE-AC52-06NA25396],"This work is supported in part by NIH/NIGMS/MIDAS under grant U01-GM097658-01 and the Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA).

While changes in microbial community structure are demonstrably associated with certain environmental conditions (from metabolic and immunological health in mammals to ecological stability in soils and oceans), identification of underlying mechanisms requires new statistical tools, as these datasets present several technical challenges. First, the abundances of microbial operational taxonomic units (OTUs) from amplicon-based datasets are compositional. Counts are normalized to the total number of counts in the sample. Thus, microbial abundances are not independent, and traditional statistical metrics (e.g., correlation) for the detection of OTU-OTU relationships can lead to spurious results. Secondly, microbial sequencing-based studies typically measure hundreds of OTUs on only tens to hundreds of samples; thus, inference of OTU-OTU association networks is severely under-powered, and additional information (or assumptions) are required for accurate inference. Here, we present SPIEC-EASI (SParse InversE Covariance Estimation for Ecological Association Inference), a statistical method for the inference of microbial ecological networks from amplicon sequencing datasets that addresses both of these issues. SPIEC-EASI combines data transformations developed for compositional data analysis with a graphical model inference framework that assumes the underlying ecological association network is sparse. To reconstruct the network, SPIEC-EASI relies on algorithms for sparse neighborhood and inverse covariance selection. To provide a synthetic benchmark in the absence of an experimentally validated gold-standard network, SPIEC-EASI is accompanied by a set of computational tools to generate OTU count data from a set of diverse underlying network topologies. SPIEC-EASI outperforms state-of-the-art methods to recover edges and network properties on synthetic data under a variety of scenarios. SPIEC-EASI also reproducibly predicts previously unknown microbial associations using data from the American Gut project.","[Kurtz, Zachary D.; Miraldi, Emily R.; Littman, Dan R.; Blaser, Martin J.] NYU, Sch Med, Dept Microbiol, New York, NY 10016 USA; [Kurtz, Zachary D.; Miraldi, Emily R.; Littman, Dan R.; Blaser, Martin J.] NYU, Sch Med, Dept Med, New York, NY USA; [Mueller, Christian L.; Miraldi, Emily R.; Bonneau, Richard A.] NYU, Dept Biol, Ctr Genom & Syst Biol, New York, NY 10003 USA; [Mueller, Christian L.; Miraldi, Emily R.; Bonneau, Richard A.] NYU, Courant Inst Math Sci, New York, NY USA; [Bonneau, Richard A.] Simons Fdn, Simons Ctr Data Anal, New York, NY USA","Kurtz, ZD (reprint author), NYU, Sch Med, Dept Microbiol, New York, NY 10016 USA.",rb133@nyu.edu,,,"National Institutes of Health [T32AI007180-30, R01 DK103358-01, RO1 GM63270]; Simons Foundation","This work was supported by the National Institutes of Health grants T32AI007180-30 (ZDK, ERM), R01 DK103358-01 (DRL, RAB) and RO1 GM63270 (MJB) and the Simons Foundation (CLM, ERM, RAB).

Here we describe a dynamic programming approach for model-free sequence comparison that incorporates high-throughput chemical probing data. Based on SHAPE probing data alone, ribosomal RNAs (rRNAs) from three diverse organisms - the eubacteria E. coli and C. difficile and the archeon H. volcanii - could be aligned with accuracies comparable to alignments based on actual sequence identity. When both base sequence identity and chemical probing reactivities were considered together, accuracies improved further. Derived sequence alignments and chemical probing data from protein-free RNAs were then used as pseudo-free energy constraints to model consensus secondary structures for the 16S and 23S rRNAs. There are critical differences between these experimentally-informed models and currently accepted models, including in the functionally important neck and decoding regions of the 16S rRNA. We infer that the 16S rRNA has evolved to undergo large-scale changes in base pairing as part of ribosome function. As high-quality RNA probing data become widely available, structurally-informed sequence alignment will become broadly useful for de novo motif and function discovery.","[Lavender, Christopher A.; Zhang, Ge; Weeks, Kevin M.] Univ N Carolina, Dept Chem, Chapel Hill, NC 27514 USA; [Lorenz, Ronny; Hofacker, Ivo L.] Univ Vienna, Inst Theoret Chem, Vienna, Austria; [Lorenz, Ronny] Univ Leipzig, Dept Comp Sci, Bioinformat Grp, D-04109 Leipzig, Germany; [Tamayo, Rita] Univ N Carolina, Dept Microbiol & Immunol, Chapel Hill, NC USA; [Hofacker, Ivo L.] Univ Vienna, Bioinformat & Computat Biol, Vienna, Austria","Lavender, CA (reprint author), Univ N Carolina, Dept Chem, Chapel Hill, NC 27514 USA.",weeks@unc.edu,"Hofacker, Ivo/A-2378-2013; Hofacker, Ivo/O-3430-2019; Lorenz, Ronny/A-6713-2015","Hofacker, Ivo/0000-0001-7132-0800; Hofacker, Ivo/0000-0001-7132-0800; Lorenz, Ronny/0000-0002-2144-698X; Lavender, Christopher/0000-0002-7762-1089","NIH [R01 AI068462, U54-AI057157]; NSF [MCB-1121024]; Austrian FWF [SFB F43]","This work was supported by grants from the NIH (R01 AI068462 to KMW and U54-AI057157 to RT), the NSF (MCB-1121024 to KMW) and the Austrian FWF (SFB F43 to ILH).

The second-order free-rider problem, in which players who do not provide the incentives dominate in a game, is a well-known academic challenge. In order to meet this challenge, we devise and analyze a meta-incentive game that integrates positive incentives (rewards) and negative incentives (punishments) with second-order incentives, which are incentives for other players' incentives. The critical assumption of our model is that players who tend to provide incentives to other players for their cooperative or non-cooperative behavior also tend to provide incentives to their incentive behaviors. In this paper, we solve the replicator dynamics for a simple version of the game and analytically categorize the game types into four groups. We find that the second-order free-rider problem is completely resolved without any third-order or higher (meta) incentive under the assumption. To do so, a second-order costly incentive, which is given individually (peer-to-peer) after playing donation games, is needed. The paper concludes that (1) second-order incentives for first-order reward are necessary for cooperative regimes, (2) a system without first-order rewards cannot maintain a cooperative regime, (3) a system with first-order rewards and no incentives for rewards is the worst because it never reaches cooperation, and (4) a system with rewards for incentives is more likely to be a cooperative regime than a system with punishments for incentives when the cost-effect ratio of incentives is sufficiently large. This solution is general and strong in the sense that the game does not need any centralized institution or proactive system for incentives.","[Okada, Isamu] Soka Univ, Dept Business Adm, Tokyo, Japan; [Okada, Isamu] Vienna Univ Econ & Business, Dept Informat Syst & Operat, Vienna, Austria; [Yamamoto, Hitoshi] Rissho Univ, Dept Business Adm, Tokyo, Japan; [Toriumi, Fujio] Univ Tokyo, Dept Syst Innovat, Tokyo, Japan; [Sasaki, Tatsuya] Univ Vienna, Fac Math, Vienna, Austria","Okada, I (reprint author), Soka Univ, Dept Business Adm, Tokyo, Japan.",okada@soka.ac.jp,"Toriumi, Fujio/L-5551-2019; Sasaki, Tatsuya/A-9993-2012","Toriumi, Fujio/0000-0003-3866-4956; Sasaki, Tatsuya/0000-0002-4635-1389; Yamamoto, Hitoshi/0000-0001-7966-2629","Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (KAKENHI) [22520160, 26330387]; Foundational Questions in Evolutionary Biology Fund [RFP-12-21]; Austrian Science Fund (FWF) [P27018-G11]","IO acknowledges support by the Grants-in-aid for Scientific Research from the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (KAKENHI) 22520160.

In the presence of HGT events, different fragments of the genome are the result of different evolutionary histories. This can therefore complicate the investigations of evolutionary relatedness of lineages and species. Also, as HGT can bring into genomes radically different genotypes from distant lineages, or even new genes bearing new functions, it is a major source of phenotypic innovation and a mechanism of niche adaptation. For example, of particular relevance to human health is the lateral transfer of antibiotic resistance and pathogenicity determinants, leading to the emergence of pathogenic lineages [1]. Computational identification of HGT events relies upon the investigation of sequence composition or evolutionary history of genes. Sequence composition-based (""parametric"") methods search for deviations from the genomic average, whereas evolutionary history-based (""phylogenetic"") approaches identify genes whose evolutionary history significantly differs from that of the host species. The evaluation and benchmarking of HGT inference methods typically rely upon simulated genomes, for which the true history is known. On real data, different methods tend to infer different HGT events, and as a result it can be difficult to ascertain all but simple and clear-cut HGT events.","[Ravenhall, Matt; Lassalle, Florent; Dessimoz, Christophe] UCL, London, England; [Skunca, Nives] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Zurich, Switzerland; [Skunca, Nives] Swiss Inst Bioinformat, Zurich, Switzerland; [Dessimoz, Christophe] European Bioinformat Inst, European Mol Biol Lab, Cambridge, England","Ravenhall, M (reprint author), UCL, London, England.",c.dessimoz@ucl.ac.uk,"Dessimoz, Christophe/H-5072-2019; Dessimoz, Christophe/D-3678-2011","Dessimoz, Christophe/0000-0002-2170-853X; Dessimoz, Christophe/0000-0002-2170-853X; Ravenhall, Matt/0000-0002-7818-2348; Lassalle, Florent/0000-0001-8957-2520",ERC [BIG_IDEA 260801]; SNSF [136461],FL was supported by ERC grant BIG_IDEA 260801.

We examine how the altered metabolism of cancer cells is reflected in the rewiring of co-expression patterns among metabolic genes. Focusing on breast and clear-cell kidney tumors, we report the existence of key metabolic genes which act as hubs of differential co-expression, showing significantly different co-regulation patterns between normal and tumor states. We compare our findings to those from classical differential expression analysis, and counterintuitively observe that the extent of a gene's differential co-expression only weakly correlates with its differential expression, suggesting that the two measures probe different features of metabolism. Focusing on this discrepancy, we use changes in co-expression patterns to highlight the apparent loss of regulation by the transcription factor HNF4A in clear cell renal cell carcinoma, despite no differential expression of HNF4A. Finally, we aggregate the results of differential co-expression analysis into a Pan-Cancer analysis across seven distinct cancer types to identify pairs of metabolic genes which may be recurrently dysregulated. Among our results is a cluster of four genes, all components of the mitochondrial electron transport chain, which show significant loss of co-expression in tumor tissue, pointing to potential mitochondrial dysfunction in these tumor types.","[Reznik, Ed; Sander, Chris] Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, Computat Biol Program, New York, NY 10021 USA","Reznik, E (reprint author), Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, Computat Biol Program, 1275 York Ave, New York, NY 10021 USA.",reznike@mskcc.org,,"Reznik, Ed/0000-0002-6511-5947","U.S. National Institutes of Health: Division of Biomedical Technology, Bioinformatics, and Computational Biology [P41 GM103504]; National Human Genome Research Institute [U41 HG006623]; National Cancer Institute Cancer Genome Atlas [U24 CA143840]","ER and CS were supported by grants from the U.S. National Institutes of Health: Division of Biomedical Technology, Bioinformatics, and Computational Biology (P41 GM103504), National Human Genome Research Institute (U41 HG006623) and the National Cancer Institute Cancer Genome Atlas (U24 CA143840).

This accumulation has been shown to often occur clonally, where mutant mtDNA grow in number and overpopulate the wild-type mtDNA. However, the cell possesses quality control (QC) mechanisms that maintain mitochondrial function, in which dysfunctional mitochondria are isolated and removed by selective fusion and mitochondrial autophagy (mitophagy), respectively. The aim of this study is to elucidate the circumstances related to mitochondrial QC that allow the expansion of mutant mtDNA molecules. For the purpose of the study, we have developed a mathematical model of mitochondrial QC process by extending our previous validated model of mitochondrial turnover and fusion-fission. A global sensitivity analysis of the model suggested that the selectivity of mitophagy and fusion is the most critical QC parameter for clearing de novo mutant mtDNA molecules. We further simulated several scenarios involving perturbations of key QC parameters to gain a better understanding of their dynamic and synergistic interactions. Our model simulations showed that a higher frequency of mitochondrial fusion-fission can provide a faster clearance of mutant mtDNA, but only when mutant-rich mitochondria that are transiently created are efficiently prevented from re-fusing with other mitochondria and selectively removed. Otherwise, faster fusion-fission quickens the accumulation of mutant mtDNA. Finally, we used the insights gained from model simulations and analysis to propose a possible circumstance involving deterioration of mitochondrial QC that permits mutant mtDNA to expand with age.","[Tam, Zhi Yang] Nanyang Technol Univ, Lee Kong Chian Sch Med, Singapore 639798, Singapore; [Gruber, Jan; Halliwell, Barry] Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Biochem, Ctr Life Sci, Singapore 117548, Singapore; [Gruber, Jan] Natl Univ Singapore, Yale NUS Coll, Div Sci, Singapore 117548, Singapore; [Gunawan, Rudiyanto] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Inst Chem & Bioengn, Zurich, Switzerland; [Gunawan, Rudiyanto] Swiss Inst Bioinformat, Lausanne, Switzerland","Tam, ZY (reprint author), Nanyang Technol Univ, Lee Kong Chian Sch Med, Singapore 639798, Singapore.",rudi.gunawan@chem.ethz.ch,"Gunawan, Rudiyanto/D-4650-2009; Halliwell, Barry/C-8318-2009","Gunawan, Rudiyanto/0000-0002-6480-7976; ","ETH Zurich; Swiss National Science Foundation [150522]; Ministry of Education Singapore [MOE2010-T2-2-048, MOE2012-T2-2-003]","TZY and RG would like to acknowledge research funding from ETH Zurich.

Focusing on the calcium-induced differentiation of primary human keratinocytes as a model system for a major cellular reorganization process, we look at the expression of genes whose products are involved in manually-annotated protein complexes. Clustering analyses revealed only moderate co-expression of functionally related proteins during differentiation. However, when we looked at protein complexes, we found that the majority (55%) are composed of non-dynamic and dynamic gene products ('di-chromatic'), 19% are non-dynamic, and 26% only dynamic. Considering three-dimensional protein structures to predict steric interactions, we found that proteins encoded by dynamic genes frequently interact with a common non-dynamic protein in a mutually exclusive fashion. This suggests that during differentiation, complex assemblies may also change through variation in the abundance of proteins that compete for binding to common proteins as found in some cases for paralogous proteins. Considering the example of the TNF-alpha/NF kappa B signaling complex, we suggest that the same core complex can guide signals into diverse context-specific outputs by addition of time specific expressed subunits, while keeping other cellular functions constant. Thus, our analysis provides evidence that complex assembly with stable core components and competition could contribute to cell differentiation.","[Toufighi, Kiana; Yang, Jae-Seong; Miguel Luis, Nuno; Aznar Benitah, Salvador; Lehner, Ben; Serrano, Luis; Kiel, Christina] EMBL, CRG Syst Biol Res Unit, CRG, Barcelona, Spain; [Toufighi, Kiana; Yang, Jae-Seong; Miguel Luis, Nuno; Aznar Benitah, Salvador; Lehner, Ben; Serrano, Luis; Kiel, Christina] Univ Pompeu Fabra, Barcelona, Spain; [Aznar Benitah, Salvador] Parc Cient Barcelona, Inst Res Biomed, Barcelona, Spain; [Lehner, Ben; Serrano, Luis] Inst Catalana Recerca & Estudis Avancats, Barcelona, Spain","Toufighi, K (reprint author), EMBL, CRG Syst Biol Res Unit, CRG, Barcelona, Spain.",salvador.aznar-benitah@irbbarcelona.org; ben.lehner@crg.eu; luis.serrano@crg.eu; christina.kiel@crg.eu,"Lehner, Ben/L-3413-2014; Aznar-Benitah, Salvador/F-4761-2016; Luis, Nuno/F-2405-2012; Serrano, Luis/B-3355-2013","Lehner, Ben/0000-0002-8817-1124; Aznar-Benitah, Salvador/0000-0002-9059-5049; Luis, Nuno/0000-0001-5438-9638; Serrano, Luis/0000-0002-5276-1392; Yang, Jae-Seong/0000-0001-9910-3170",La Caixa PhD fellowship; European Union [PRIMES_278568]; Spanish Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad [BIO2012-39754]; European Fund for Regional Development; ICREA; Worldwide Cancer Research [13-1064],"KT is funded by a La Caixa PhD fellowship.

Using a semi-automated reconstruction algorithm, we reconstructed a genome-scale metabolic model, ToxoNet1. The reconstruction process and flux-balance analysis of the model offer a systematic overview of the metabolic capabilities of this parasite. Using ToxoNet1 we have identified significant gaps in the current knowledge of Toxoplasma metabolic pathways and have clarified its minimal nutritional requirements for replication. By probing the model via metabolic tasks, we have further defined sets of alternative precursors necessary for parasite growth. Within a human host cell environment, ToxoNet1 predicts a minimal set of 53 enzyme-coding genes and 76 reactions to be essential for parasite replication. Double-gene-essentiality analysis identified 20 pairs of genes for which simultaneous deletion is deleterious. To validate several predictions of ToxoNet1 we have performed experimental analyses of cytosolic acetyl-CoA biosynthesis. ATP-citrate lyase and acetyl-CoA synthase were localised and their corresponding genes disrupted, establishing that each of these enzymes is dispensable for the growth of T. gondii, however together they make a synthetic lethal pair.","[Tymoshenko, Stepan] Ecole Polytech Fed Lausanne, Lab Computat Syst Biotechnol, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland; [Tymoshenko, Stepan; Oppenheim, Rebecca D.; Soldati-Favre, Dominique; Hatzimanikatis, Vassily] Univ Geneva, Dept Microbiol & Mol Med, Fac Med, CMU, Geneva, Switzerland; [Tymoshenko, Stepan; Hatzimanikatis, Vassily] Swiss Inst Bioinformat, Lausanne, Switzerland; [Agren, Rasmus; Nielsen, Jens] Chalmers Univ Technol, Dept Chem & Biol Engn, S-41296 Gothenburg, Sweden","Tymoshenko, S (reprint author), Ecole Polytech Fed Lausanne, Lab Computat Syst Biotechnol, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland.",Dominique.Soldati-Favre@unige.ch; Vassily.Hatzimanikatis@epfl.ch,"Hatzimanikatis, Vassily/G-6505-2010; Nielsen, Jens/Q-1347-2017","Hatzimanikatis, Vassily/0000-0001-6432-4694; Soldati-Favre, Dominique/0000-0003-4156-2109; Nielsen, Jens/0000-0002-9955-6003",SystemsX.ch; Swiss Initiative for Systems Biology by the Swiss National Science Foundation; iGE3 student salary award; Ecole polytechnique federale de Lausanne (EPFL); Knut and Alice Wallenberg Foundation,"ST is supported by an IPhD grant and the RTD grant MalarX, both within SystemsX.ch, the Swiss Initiative for Systems Biology evaluated by the Swiss National Science Foundation; RDO is supported by the iGE3 student salary award.

However, the specificity of the response across stimuli and cell types, and the roles of non-coding RNAs are not well understood. Using a large collection of densely-sampled time series expression data we have examined the induction of the immediate-early response in unparalleled detail, across cell types and stimuli. We exploit cap analysis of gene expression (CAGE) time series datasets to directly measure promoter activities over time. Using a novel analysis method for time series data we identify transcripts with expression patterns that closely resemble the dynamics of known immediate-early genes (IEGs) and this enables a comprehensive comparative study of these genes and their chromatin state. Surprisingly, these data suggest that the earliest transcriptional responses often involve promoters generating non-coding RNAs, many of which are produced in advance of canonical protein-coding IEGs. IEGs are known to be capable of induction without de novo protein synthesis. Consistent with this, we find that the response of both protein-coding and non-coding RNA IEGs can be explained by their transcriptionally poised, permissive chromatin state prior to stimulation. We also explore the function of non-coding RNAs in the attenuation of the immediate early response in a small RNA sequencing dataset matched to the CAGE data: We identify a novel set of microRNAs responsible for the attenuation of the IEG response in an estrogen receptor positive cancer cell line. Our computational statistical method is well suited to meta-analyses as there is no requirement for transcripts to pass thresholds for significant differential expression between time points, and it is agnostic to the number of time points per dataset.","[Aitken, Stuart; Semple, Colin A.] Univ Edinburgh, MRC Inst Genet & Mol Med, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland; [Magi, Shigeyuki; Okada-Hatakeyama, Mariko] IMS, RIKEN Ctr Integrat Med Sci, Lab Integrated Cellular Syst, Tsurumi Ku, Yokohama, Kanagawa, Japan; [Alhendi, Ahmad M.

Using a computational neuronal model, we find that stimulus-locked responses are generated when sound-evoked excitation is combined with strong, delayed inhibition. In contrast to this, a non-synchronized rate representation is generated when the net excitation evoked by the sound is weak, which occurs when excitation is coincident and balanced with inhibition. Using single-unit recordings from awake marmosets (Callithrix jacchus), we validate several model predictions, including differences in the temporal fidelity, discharge rates and temporal dynamics of stimulus-evoked responses between neurons with rate and temporal representations.

Different mechanisms for cell lysis have been proposed, but these models tend to neglect the role of the chemical composition of the membrane, which differs between bacterial species and can be heterogeneous even within a single cell. Moreover, the cell envelope of Gram-negative bacteria such as E. coli contains two membranes with differing compositions. To this end, we report the first molecular dynamics simulation study of the interaction of the antimicrobial peptide, polymyxin B1 with complex models of both the inner and outer membranes of E. coli. The results of > 16 micro-seconds of simulation predict that polymyxin B1 is likely to interact with the membranes via distinct mechanisms. The lipopeptides aggregate in the lipopolysaccharide headgroup region of the outer membrane with limited tendency for insertion within the lipid A tails. In contrast, the lipopeptides readily insert into the inner membrane core, and the concomitant increased hydration may be responsible for bilayer destabilization and antimicrobial function. Given the urgent need to develop novel, potent antibiotics, the results presented here reveal key mechanistic details that may be exploited for future rational drug development.","[Berglund, Nils A.; Piggot, Thomas J.; Jefferies, Damien; Khalid, Syma] Univ Southampton, Sch Chem, Southampton, Hants, England; [Berglund, Nils A.; Bond, Peter J.] ASTAR, Bioinformat Inst, Singapore, Singapore; [Sessions, Richard B.] Sch Biochem, Bristol, Avon, England; [Bond, Peter J.] Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Biol Sci, Singapore 117548, Singapore","Berglund, NA (reprint author), Univ Southampton, Sch Chem, Southampton, Hants, England.",S.Khalid@soton.ac.uk,"Khalid, Syma/P-6868-2019; Khalid, Syma/B-8108-2009","Khalid, Syma/0000-0002-3694-5044; Khalid, Syma/0000-0002-3694-5044; Bond, Peter/0000-0003-2900-098X","Agency of Science, Technology and Research, Singapore, under the ARAP scheme; BBSRC [BB/H000658/1]; Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council [BB/H000658/1]; Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council [EP/L000253/1]","NAB received funding from The Agency of Science, Technology and Research, Singapore, under the ARAP scheme.

Epidemiological principles governing the design of successful control are not well-understood. We analyse factors underlying the effectiveness of reactive eradication of localised outbreaks of invading plant disease, using citrus canker in Florida as a case study, although our results are largely generic, and apply to other plant pathogens (as we show via our second case study, citrus greening). We demonstrate how to optimise control via removal of hosts surrounding detected infection (i.e. localised culling) using a spatially-explicit, stochastic epidemiological model. We show how to define optimal culling strategies that take account of stochasticity in disease spread, and how the effectiveness of disease control depends on epidemiological parameters determining pathogen infectivity, symptom emergence and spread, the initial level of infection, and the logistics and implementation of detection and control. We also consider how optimal culling strategies are conditioned on the levels of risk acceptance/aversion of decision makers, and show how to extend the analyses to account for potential larger-scale impacts of a small-scale outbreak. Control of local outbreaks by culling can be very effective, particularly when started quickly, but the optimum strategy and its performance are strongly dependent on epidemiological parameters (particularly those controlling dispersal and the extent of any cryptic infection, i.e. infectious hosts prior to symptoms), the logistics of detection and control, and the level of local and global risk that is deemed to be acceptable.

Dissecting the underlying relations is crucial to predict the impact of targeted perturbations. However, a major challenge in identifying cell-context specific signaling networks is the enormous number of potentially possible interactions. Here, we report a novel hybrid mathematical modeling strategy to systematically unravel hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) stimulated phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K) and mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling, which critically contribute to liver regeneration. By combining time-resolved quantitative experimental data generated in primary mouse hepatocytes with interaction graph and ordinary differential equation modeling, we identify and experimentally validate a network structure that represents the experimental data best and indicates specific crosstalk mechanisms. Whereas the identified network is robust against single perturbations, combinatorial inhibition strategies are predicted that result in strong reduction of Akt and ERK activation. Thus, by capitalizing on the advantages of the two modeling approaches, we reduce the high combinatorial complexity and identify cell-context specific signaling networks.","[D'Alessandro, Lorenza A.; Bonefas, Sandra; Iwamoto, Nao; Kienast, Alexandra; Waldow, Katharina; Meyer, Rene; Schilling, Marcel; Klingmueller, Ursula] German Canc Res Ctr, Div Syst Biol Signal Transduct, Heidelberg, Germany; [Samaga, Regina; Klamt, Steffen] Max Planck Inst Dynam Complex Tech Syst, Magdeburg, Germany; [Maiwald, Tim; Rho, Seong-Hwan; Raue, Andreas; Timmer, Jens] Univ Freiburg, Inst Phys, D-79106 Freiburg, Germany; [Maiwald, Tim; Rho, Seong-Hwan; Raue, Andreas; Timmer, Jens] Univ Freiburg, BIOSS Ctr Biol Signalling Studies, D-79106 Freiburg, Germany; [Raue, Andreas] Merrimack Pharmaceut Inc, Cambridge, MA USA","D'Alessandro, LA (reprint author), German Canc Res Ctr, Div Syst Biol Signal Transduct, INF 280, Heidelberg, Germany.",jeti@fdm.uni-freiburg.de; klamt@mpi-magdeburg.mpg.de; u.klingmueller@dkfz.de,"Schilling, Marcel/A-4426-2008; Klingmuller, Ursula/G-8477-2013","Schilling, Marcel/0000-0002-9517-5166; Klingmuller, Ursula/0000-0001-9845-3099; Klamt, Steffen/0000-0003-2563-7561; Iwamoto, Nao/0000-0003-3362-375X; Maiwald, Tim/0000-0002-4525-9556","German Federal Ministry of Education and Research within the Hepatosys and Virtual Liver Network [0315745, 0315744, 0315766]; German Federal Ministry of Education and Research within the e:Bio ""JAK-Sys"" Consortium [0316167B]; German Federal Ministry of Education and Research within the e: Bio ""SBEpo"" Consortium [0316182B]; 7th Framework Initiative via the FP7-HEALTH-2007-2.1.2.5 call in the project CancerSys [223188]; IMI/EFPIA","German Federal Ministry of Education and Research within the Hepatosys and Virtual Liver Network (grant 0315745, 0315744, 0315766): LAD, SHR, TM, RS, SK, JT, KW, SB, AR, UK.

Current advances in staining and imaging of biological tissues provide a wealth of data, but there are few metrics to quantitatively describe these findings. In particular there is a need for a metric that would characterize the correlation and consistency of orientation of different biological constructs within a tissue. We aimed to create such a metric and to demonstrate its use with images of cardiac tissues. The co-orientational order parameter (COOP) was based on the mathematical framework of a classical parameter, the orientational order parameter (OOP). Theorems were proven to illustrate the properties and boundaries of the COOP, which was then applied to both synthetic and experimental data. We showed the COOP to be useful for quantifying the correlation of orientation of constructs such as actin filaments and sarcomeric Z-lines. As expected, cardiac tissues showed perfect correlation between actin filaments and Z-lines. We also demonstrated the use of COOP to quantify the consistency of construct orientation within cells of the same shape. The COOP provides a quantitative tool to characterize tissues beyond co-localization or single construct orientation distribution. In the future, this new parameter could be used to represent the quantitative changes during maturation of cardiac tissue, pathological malformation, and other processes.","[Drew, Nancy K.; Eagleson, Mackenzie A.; Baldo, Danny B., Jr.; Grosberg, Anna] Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Biomed Engn, Irvine, CA 92697 USA; [Eagleson, Mackenzie A.; Parker, Kevin Kit] Harvard Univ, Sch Engn & Appl Sci, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Grosberg, Anna] Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Chem Engn, Irvine, CA USA","Drew, NK (reprint author), Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Biomed Engn, Irvine, CA 92697 USA.",grosberg@uci.edu,,,"National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering; National Research Service Award from the University of California, Irvine [EB009418]; Center for Complex Biological Systems [NSF CBET-1338609]; NIH-NHLBI [U01-HL100408]; NIH [R01 HL079126]","This investigation was supported by the National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering, National Research Service Award EB009418 from the University of California, Irvine, Center for Complex Biological Systems, NSF CBET-1338609 (AG), NIH-NHLBI U01-HL100408 (KKP), and NIH grant R01 HL079126 (KKP).

In this paper, emergent laws for describing mechanochemical systems are investigated for processive myosin-actin motility systems. On the basis of prior experimental evidence that longer processive lifetimes are enabled by larger myosin ensembles, it is hypothesized that emergent scaling laws could coincide with myosin-actin contact probability or system energy consumption. Because processivity is difficult to predict analytically and measure experimentally, agent-based computational techniques are developed to simulate processive myosin ensembles and produce novel processive lifetime measurements. It is demonstrated that only systems energy relationships hold regardless of isoform configurations or ensemble size, and a unified expression for predicting processive lifetime is revealed. The finding of such laws provides insight for how patterns emerge in stochastic mechanochemical systems, while also informing understanding and engineering of complex biological systems.","[Egan, Paul; Cagan, Jonathan; LeDuc, Philip] Carnegie Mellon Univ, Dept Mech Engn, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA; [Moore, Jeffrey] Boston Univ, Sch Med, Dept Physiol & Biophys, Boston, MA 02118 USA; [Schunn, Christian] Univ Pittsburgh, Dept Psychol, Pittsburgh, PA 15260 USA","Egan, P (reprint author), Carnegie Mellon Univ, Dept Mech Engn, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA.",schunn@pitt.edu; cagan@cmu.edu; prl@andrew.cmu.edu,"Egan, Paul Francis/E-1599-2013; Schunn, Christian D./H-2468-2011","Egan, Paul Francis/0000-0003-1252-5819; Schunn, Christian D./0000-0003-3589-297X",National Science Foundation [CMMI-1160840]; National Defense Science and Engineering Graduate Fellowship,"The study was supported through funding from National Science Foundation Grant CMMI-1160840 and the National Defense Science and Engineering Graduate Fellowship.

Using deep sequencing, we analyzed a unique collection of longitudinal viral samples from 93 patients who have been treated with therapies containing protease inhibitors (PIs). Due to the high sequence coverage within each sample, the frequencies of mutations at individual positions were calculated with high precision. We used this information to characterize the variability in the Gag polyprotein and its effects on PI-therapy outcomes. To examine covariation of mutations between two different sites using deep sequencing data, we developed an approach to estimate the tight bounds on the two-site bivariate probabilities in each viral sample, and the mutual information between pairs of positions based on all the bounds. Utilizing the new methodology we found that mutations in the matrix and p6 proteins contribute to continued therapy failure and have a major role in the network of strongly correlated mutations in the Gag polyprotein, as well as between Gag and protease. Although covariation is not direct evidence of structural propensities, we found the strongest correlations between residues on capsid and matrix of the same Gag protein were often due to structural proximity. This suggests that some of the strongest inter-protein Gag correlations are the result of structural proximity. Moreover, the strong covariation between residues in matrix and capsid at the N-terminus with p1 and p6 at the C-terminus is consistent with residue-residue contacts between these proteins at some point in the viral life cycle.","[Flynn, William F.] Rutgers State Univ, Dept Phys & Astron, Piscataway, NJ 08854 USA; [Flynn, William F.; Levy, Ronald M.] Temple Univ, Ctr Biophys & Computat Biol, Philadelphia, PA 19122 USA; [Chang, Max W.; Oliveira, Glenn; Yuan, Jinyun; Torbett, Bruce E.] Scripps Res Inst, Dept Mol & Expt Med, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA; [Tan, Zhiqiang] Rutgers State Univ, Dept Stat, Piscataway, NJ USA; [Okulicz, Jason F.] San Antonio Mil Med Ctr, Infect Dis Serv, San Antonio, TX USA; [Levy, Ronald M.] Temple Univ, Dept Chem, Philadelphia, PA 19122 USA; [Levy, Ronald M.] Temple Univ, Inst Computat Mol Sci, Philadelphia, PA 19122 USA","Flynn, WF (reprint author), Rutgers State Univ, Dept Phys & Astron, Piscataway, NJ 08854 USA.",betorbet@scripps.edu; ronlevy@temple.edu,,"Chang, Max/0000-0002-4526-489X","National Institute of General Medical Science; National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases of the National Institutes of Health [NIH P50GM103368, UL1 RR025774, NIH R01 GM30580]; CFAR [P30AI036214]; NIH [T32-AI007354]; National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, NIH [Y1-AI-5072]","Research reported in this publication was supported by the National Institute of General Medical Science (www.nigms.nih.gov) and the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (www.niaid.nih.gov) of the National Institutes of Health (www.nih.gov) under award numbers: NIH P50GM103368 (BET, RML), UL1 RR025774 Pilot Award (BET), NIH R01 GM30580 (RML), and with Core support provided by CFAR, P30AI036214 (BET).

There has also been a shift over the same time period in the age group reporting the largest number of cases (aside from infants), from adolescents to 7-11 year olds. We use epidemiological modelling and a large case incidence dataset to explain the upsurge. We investigate several hypotheses for the upsurge in pertussis cases by fitting a suite of dynamic epidemiological models to incidence data from the National Notifiable Disease Surveillance System (NNDSS) between 1990-2009, as well as incidence data from a variety of sources from 1950-1989. We find that: 1) the best-fitting model is one in which vaccine efficacy and duration of protection of the acellular pertussis (aP) vaccine is lower than that of the whole-cell (wP) vaccine, (efficacy of the first three doses 80% [95% CI: 78%, 82%] versus 90% [95% CI: 87%, 94%]), 2) increasing the rate at which disease is reported to NNDSS is not sufficient to explain the upsurge and 3) 2010-2012 disease incidence is predicted well. In this study, we use all available U.S. surveillance data to: fit a set of mathematical models and determine which best explains these data and determine the epidemiological and vaccine-related parameter values of this model. We find evidence of a difference in efficacy and duration of protection between the two vaccine types, wP and aP (aP efficacy and duration lower than wP). Future refinement of the model presented here will allow for an exploration of alternative vaccination strategies such as different age-spacings, further booster doses, and cocooning.","[Gambhir, Manoj] Monash Univ, Dept Epidemiol & Prevent Med, Melbourne, Vic 3004, Australia; [Gambhir, Manoj; Swerdlow, L.] Ctr Dis Control & Prevent CDC, Modeling Unit, Natl Ctr Immunizat & Resp Dis NCIRD, Atlanta, GA USA; [Gambhir, Manoj] IHRC Inc, Atlanta, GA USA; [Clark, Thomas A.] CDC, Meningitis & Vaccine Preventable Dis Branch, Div Bacterial Dis, NCIRD, Atlanta, GA 30333 USA; [Cauchemez, Simon; Ferguson, Neil M.] Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, MRC, Ctr Outbreak Anal & Modelling, London, England; [Cauchemez, Simon] Inst Pasteur, Math Modelling Infect Dis Unit, Paris, France; [Tartof, Sara Y.] Kaiser Permanente Res, Kaiser Permanente So Calif, Dept Res & Evaluat, Pasadena, CA USA; [Swerdlow, L.] CDC, Off Sci & Integrat Programs, NCIRD, Atlanta, GA 30333 USA","Gambhir, M (reprint author), Monash Univ, Dept Epidemiol & Prevent Med, Melbourne, Vic 3004, Australia.",manoj.gambhir@monash.edu,"Ferguson, Neil/B-8578-2008","Ferguson, Neil/0000-0002-1154-8093; Gambhir, Manoj/0000-0002-4831-6261","UK Medical Research Council [MR/K010174/1]; UK National Institute of Health Research (Health Protection Research Unit funding) [HPRU-2012-10080]; U.S. National Insitutes of Health NIGMS MIDAS [1U01GM110721-01]; Medical Research Council [MR/K010174/1B, MR/K010174/1]; National Institute for Health Research [NF-SI-0508-10252]","This work was funded by: UK Medical Research Council (Centre funding), Grant Number MR/K010174/1, UK National Institute of Health Research (Health Protection Research Unit funding), Grant Number HPRU-2012-10080, U.S. National Insitutes of Health NIGMS MIDAS (Grant funding): Models for synthesising molecular, clinical and epidemiological data, and translation to public health response, Grant Number 1U01GM110721-01.

Understanding how these mutations affect the structure-function relationship of IDPs is a formidable task that requires detailed characterization of the disordered conformational ensembles. Implicit solvent coupled with enhanced sampling has been proposed to provide a balance between accuracy and efficiency necessary for systematic and comparative assessments of the effects of mutations as well as post-translational modifications on IDP structure and interaction. Here, we utilize a recently developed replica exchange with guided annealing enhanced sampling technique to calculate well-converged atomistic conformational ensembles of the intrinsically disordered transactivation domain (TAD) of tumor suppressor p53 and several cancer-associated mutants in implicit solvent. The simulations are critically assessed by quantitative comparisons with several types of experimental data that provide structural information on both secondary and tertiary levels. The results show that the calculated ensembles reproduce local structural features of wild-type p53-TAD and the effects of K24N mutation quantitatively. On the tertiary level, the simulated ensembles are overly compact, even though they appear to recapitulate the overall features of transient long-range contacts qualitatively. A key finding is that, while p53-TAD and its cancer mutants sample a similar set of conformational states, cancer mutants could introduce both local and long-range structural modulations to potentially perturb the balance of p53 binding to various regulatory proteins and further alter how this balance is regulated by multisite phosphorylation of p53-TAD. The current study clearly demonstrates the promise of atomistic simulations for detailed characterization of IDP conformations, and at the same time reveals important limitations in the current implicit solvent protein force field that must be sufficiently addressed for reliable description of long-range structural features of the disordered ensembles.","[Ganguly, Debabani; Chen, Jianhan] Kansas State Univ, Dept Biochem & Mol Biophys, Manhattan, KS 66506 USA; [Ganguly, Debabani] Indian Inst Engn Sci & Technol, Shibpur Howrah, India","Ganguly, D (reprint author), Kansas State Univ, Dept Biochem & Mol Biophys, Manhattan, KS 66506 USA.",gangulydebabani@gmail.com; jianhanc@ksu.edu,"Chen, Jianhan/C-7680-2009",,"National Science Foundation [MCB 0952514]; Johnson Center for Basic Cancer Research; Department of Biotechnology, Govt. of India [BT/RLF/Re-entry/52/2012]","This work was supported by the National Science Foundation MCB 0952514 (JC) and the Johnson Center for Basic Cancer Research (JC).

Such approaches build on the assumption that protein interaction networks can be viewed as maps in which diseases can be identified with localized perturbation within a certain neighborhood. The identification of these neighborhoods, or disease modules, is therefore a prerequisite of a detailed investigation of a particular pathophenotype. While numerous heuristic methods exist that successfully pinpoint disease associated modules, the basic underlying connectivity patterns remain largely unexplored. In this work we aim to fill this gap by analyzing the network properties of a comprehensive corpus of 70 complex diseases. We find that disease associated proteins do not reside within locally dense communities and instead identify connectivity significance as the most predictive quantity. This quantity inspires the design of a novel Disease Module Detection (DIAMOnD) algorithm to identify the full disease module around a set of known disease proteins. We study the performance of the algorithm using well-controlled synthetic data and systematically validate the identified neighborhoods for a large corpus of diseases.","[Ghiassian, Susan Dina; Menche, Joerg; Barabasi, Albert-Laszlo] Northeastern Univ, Ctr Complex Networks Res, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Ghiassian, Susan Dina; Menche, Joerg; Barabasi, Albert-Laszlo] Northeastern Univ, Dept Phys, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Ghiassian, Susan Dina; Menche, Joerg; Barabasi, Albert-Laszlo] Dana Farber Canc Inst, Ctr Canc Syst Biol CCSB, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Ghiassian, Susan Dina; Menche, Joerg; Barabasi, Albert-Laszlo] Dana Farber Canc Inst, Dept Canc Biol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Menche, Joerg; Barabasi, Albert-Laszlo] Cent European Univ, Ctr Network Sci, Budapest, Hungary; [Barabasi, Albert-Laszlo] Harvard Univ, Brigham & Womens Hosp, Channing Div Network Med, Dept Med,Med Sch, Boston, MA 02115 USA","Ghiassian, SD (reprint author), Northeastern Univ, Ctr Complex Networks Res, Boston, MA 02115 USA.",barabasi@gmail.com,"Menche, Jorg/G-3994-2015","Menche, Jorg/0000-0002-1583-6404; Barabasi, Albert/0000-0002-4028-3522",National Institutes of Health (NIH) [1U01HL108630-01],"This work was funded by National Institutes of Health (NIH) Award #1U01HL108630-01.

To lower cost and reduce the time to obtain promising peptides, machine learning approaches can greatly assist in the process and even partly replace expensive laboratory experiments by learning a predictor with existing data or with a smaller amount of data generation. Unfortunately, once the model is learned, selecting peptides having the greatest predicted bioactivity often requires a prohibitive amount of computational time. For this combinatorial problem, heuristics and stochastic optimization methods are not guaranteed to find adequate solutions. We focused on recent advances in kernel methods and machine learning to learn a predictive model with proven success. For this type of model, we propose an efficient algorithm based on graph theory, that is guaranteed to find the peptides for which the model predicts maximal bioactivity. We also present a second algorithm capable of sorting the peptides of maximal bioactivity. Extensive analyses demonstrate how these algorithms can be part of an iterative combinatorial chemistry procedure to speed up the discovery and the validation of peptide leads. Moreover, the proposed approach does not require the use of known ligands for the target protein since it can leverage recent multi-target machine learning predictors where ligands for similar targets can serve as initial training data. Finally, we validated the proposed approach in vitro with the discovery of new cationic antimicrobial peptides.

Equations are derived for each relevant cellular component (e.g., ion channel, exchanger) independently. After the equations for all components are combined to form the composite model, a subset of parameters is tuned, often arbitrarily and by hand, until the model output matches a target objective, such as an action potential. Unfortunately, such models often fail to accurately simulate behavior that is dynamically dissimilar (e.g., arrhythmia) to the simple target objective to which the model was fit. In this study, we develop a new approach in which data are collected via a series of complex electrophysiology protocols from single cardiac myocytes and then used to tune model parameters via a parallel fitting method known as a genetic algorithm (GA). The dynamical complexity of the electrophysiological data, which can only be fit by an automated method such as a GA, leads to more accurately parameterized models that can simulate rich cardiac dynamics. The feasibility of the method is first validated computationally, after which it is used to develop models of isolated guinea pig ventricular myocytes that simulate the electrophysiological dynamics significantly better than does a standard guinea pig model. In addition to improving model fidelity generally, this approach can be used to generate a cell-specific model. By so doing, the approach may be useful in applications ranging from studying the implications of cell-to-cell variability to the prediction of intersubject differences in response to pharmacological treatment.","[Groenendaal, Willemijn; Krogh-Madsen, Trine; Christini, David J.] Weill Cornell Med Coll, Greenberg Div Cardiol, New York, NY 10065 USA; [Ortega, Francis A.; Kherlopian, Armen R.; Christini, David J.] Weill Cornell Med Coll, Dept Physiol & Biophys, New York, NY USA; [Krogh-Madsen, Trine; Christini, David J.] Weill Cornell Med Coll, Inst Computat Biomed, New York, NY USA","Groenendaal, W (reprint author), Weill Cornell Med Coll, Greenberg Div Cardiol, New York, NY 10065 USA.",dchristi@med.cornell.edu,,"Ortega, Francis/0000-0003-2735-8865",National Institutes of Health [R01EB016407],"This research was funded by National Institutes of Health (http://www.nih.gov) grant R01EB016407 (to DJC).

Because sensory inputs typically have spike correlation, and local circuits have dense feedback connections, input spikes cause the propagation of spike correlation in lateral circuits; however, it is largely unknown how this secondary correlation generated by lateral circuits influences learning processes through STDP, or whether it is beneficial to achieve efficient spike-based learning from uncertain stimuli. To explore the answers to these questions, we construct models of feedforward networks with lateral inhibitory circuits and study how propagated correlation influences STDP learning, and what kind of learning algorithm such circuits achieve. We derive analytical conditions at which neurons detect minor signals with STDP, and show that depending on the origin of the noise, different correlation timescales are useful for learning. In particular, we show that non-precise spike correlation is beneficial for learning in the presence of cross-talk noise. We also show that by considering excitatory and inhibitory STDP at lateral connections, the circuit can acquire a lateral structure optimal for signal detection. In addition, we demonstrate that the model performs blind source separation in a manner similar to the sequential sampling approximation of the Bayesian independent component analysis algorithm.

Hairpin DNA structures that are formed due to overexpansion of CAG repeat lead to Huntington's disorder and spinocerebellar ataxias. Nonetheless, DNA hairpin stem structure that generally embraces B-form with canonical base pairs is poorly understood in the context of periodic noncanonical A...A mismatch as found in CAG repeat overexpansion. Molecular dynamics simulations on DNA hairpin stems containing A...A mismatches in a CAG repeat overexpansion show that A...A dictates local Z-form irrespective of starting glycosyl conformation, in sharp contrast to canonical DNA duplex. Transition from B-to-Z is due to the mechanistic effect that originates from its pronounced nonisostericity with flanking canonical base pairs facilitated by base extrusion, backbone and/or base flipping. Based on these structural insights we envisage that such an unusual DNA structure of the CAG hairpin stem may have a role in disease pathogenesis.

To explore these issues, we develop a framework allowing for the first time to quantify nation-wide risks and their age- and sex-dependence for each diabetic comorbidity, and whether the association may be consequential or causal, in a sample of almost two million patients. This study is equivalent to nearly 40,000 single clinical measurements. We confirm the highly controversial relation of increased risk for Parkinson's disease in diabetics, using a 10 times larger cohort than previous studies on this relation. Detection of type 1 diabetes leads detection of depressions, whereas there is a strong comorbidity relation between type 2 diabetes and schizophrenia, suggesting similar pathogenic or medication-related mechanisms. We find significant sex differences in the progression of, for instance, sleep disorders and congestive heart failure in diabetic patients. Hypertension is a highly sex-sensitive comorbidity with females being at lower risk during fertile age, but at higher risk otherwise. These results may be useful to improve screening practices in the general population. Clinical management of diabetes must address age- and sex-dependence of multiple comorbid conditions.","[Klimek, Peter; Chmiel, Anna; Thurner, Stefan] Med Univ Vienna, Sect Sci Complex Syst, Vienna, Austria; [Kautzky-Willer, Alexandra] Med Univ Vienna, Gender Med Unit, Vienna, Austria; [Schiller-Fruehwirth, Irmgard] Main Assoc Austrian Social Secur Inst, Vienna, Austria; [Thurner, Stefan] Santa Fe Inst, Santa Fe, NM 87501 USA; [Thurner, Stefan] IIASA, Laxenburg, Austria","Klimek, P (reprint author), Med Univ Vienna, Sect Sci Complex Syst, Vienna, Austria.",stefan.thurner@meduniwien.ac.at,,"Kautzky-Willer, Alexandra/0000-0002-3520-4105; Chmiel, Anna/0000-0002-5203-3539; Klimek, Peter/0000-0003-1187-6713","European Commission [318132, 317532]","This work was supported by the European Commission Seventh Framework Programme ICT projects LASAGNE, no. 318132, and MULTIPLEX, no. 317532.

However, distinguishing between these pathogen- and population-specific properties typically requires detailed serological studies, which are rarely available in the early stages of an outbreak. Using a simple transmission model that incorporates age-stratified social mixing patterns, we present a novel method for characterizing the transmission potential of subcritical infections, which have effective reproduction number R<1, from readily available data on the size of outbreaks. We show that the model can identify the extent to which outbreaks are driven by inherent pathogen transmissibility and pre-existing population immunity, and can generate unbiased estimates of the effective reproduction number. Applying the method to real-life infections, we obtained accurate estimates for the degree of age-specific immunity against monkeypox, influenza A(H5N1) and A(H7N9), and refined existing estimates of the reproduction number. Our results also suggest minimal pre-existing immunity to MERS-CoV in humans. The approach we describe can therefore provide crucial information about novel infections before serological surveys and other detailed analyses are available. The methods would also be applicable to data stratified by factors such as profession or location, which would make it possible to measure the transmission potential of emerging infections in a wide range of settings.","[Kucharski, Adam J.; Edmunds, W.

Bacterial uptake entails successive, increasingly strong associations between receptors on the surface of bacteria and hosts. Even with genetically identical cells grown in the same environment, there are vast differences in the number of bacteria entering any given cell. To gain insight into this variability, we examined uptake dynamics of Escherichia coli engineered to express the invasin surface receptor from Yersinia, which enables uptake via mammalian host beta(1)-integrins. Surprisingly, we found that the uptake probability of a single bacterium follows a simple power-law dependence on the concentration of integrins. Furthermore, the value of a power-law parameter depends on the particular host-bacterium pair but not on bacterial concentration. This power-law captures the complex, variable processes underlying bacterial invasion while also enabling differentiation of cell lines.","[Lee, Tae J.; Wong, Jeffrey; Bae, Sena; Lee, Anna Jisu; Lopatkin, Allison; Yuan, Fan; You, Lingchong] Duke Univ, Dept Biomed Engn, Durham, NC 27706 USA; [Lee, Tae J.; Wong, Jeffrey; Bae, Sena; You, Lingchong] Duke Univ, Ctr Genom & Computat Biol, Durham, NC USA; [You, Lingchong] Duke Univ, Ctr Syst Biol, Durham, NC USA","Lee, TJ (reprint author), Brigham & Womens Hosp, Orthoped Surg, 75 Francis St, Boston, MA 02115 USA.",you@duke.edu,,,National Science Foundation [CBET-0953202]; National Institutes of Health [1R01GM098642]; North Carolina Biotech Center [2012-MRG-1102]; DuPont Young Professorship; David and Lucile Packard Fellowship,"This work was partially supported by the National Science Foundation (LY, CBET-0953202), the National Institutes of Health (LY, 1R01GM098642), North Carolina Biotech Center (LY, 2012-MRG-1102), a DuPont Young Professorship (LY), and a David and Lucile Packard Fellowship (LY).

The central statement of embodied choice is the existence of bidirectional influences between action and decisions. This implies that for a decision expressed by an action, the action dynamics and its constraints (e.g. current trajectory and kinematics) influence the decision making process. Here we use a perceptual decision making task to compare three types of model: a serial decision-then-action model, a parallel decision-and-action model, and an embodied choice model where the action feeds back into the decision making. The embodied model incorporates two key mechanisms that together are lacking in the other models: action preparation and commitment. First, action preparation strategies alleviate delays in enacting a choice but also modify decision termination. Second, action dynamics change the prospects and create a commitment effect to the initially preferred choice. Our results show that these two mechanisms make embodied choice models better suited to combine decision and action appropriately to achieve suitably fast and accurate responses, as usually required in ecologically valid situations. Moreover, embodied choice models with these mechanisms give a better account of trajectory tracking experiments during decision making. In conclusion, the embodied choice framework offers a combined theory of decision and action that gives a clear case that embodied phenomena such as the dynamics of actions can have a causal influence on central cognition.","[Lepora, Nathan F.] Univ Bristol, Dept Engn Math, Bristol, Avon, England; [Lepora, Nathan F.] Univ Bristol, Bristol Robot Lab BRL, Bristol, Avon, England; [Lepora, Nathan F.] Univ W England, Bristol BS16 1QY, Avon, England; [Pezzulo, Giovanni] CNR, Inst Cognit Sci & Technol, Rome, Italy","Lepora, NF (reprint author), Univ Bristol, Dept Engn Math, Bristol, Avon, England.",giovanni.pezzulo@istc.cnr.it,"; Pezzulo, Giovanni/F-6854-2014","Lepora, Nathan/0000-0001-5327-1523; Pezzulo, Giovanni/0000-0001-6813-8282",European Community [FP7-270108]; Human Frontier Science Program [RGY0088/2014],"GP has received research funding from the European Community's Seventh Framework Programme, grant FP7-270108 (Goal-Leaders) and by the Human Frontier Science Program, grant RGY0088/2014.

Glioblastoma is the most common, aggressive and highly malignant type of primary brain tumor. The average overall survival remains less than 1 year. Notably, cancer patients with obesity and diabetes have worse outcomes and accelerated progression of glioblastoma. The root cause of this accelerated progression has been hypothesized to involve the insulin signaling pathway. However, while the process of invasive glioblastoma progression has been extensively studied macroscopically, it has not yet been well characterized with regards to intracellular insulin signaling. In this study we connect for the first time microscale insulin signaling activity with macroscale glioblastoma growth through the use of computational modeling. Results of the model suggest a novel observation: feedback from IGFBP2 to HIF1 alpha is integral to the sustained growth of glioblastoma. Our study suggests that downstream signaling from IGFI to HIF1 alpha, which has been the target of many insulin signaling drugs in clinical trials, plays a smaller role in overall tumor growth. These predictions strongly suggest redirecting the focus of glioma drug candidates on controlling the feedback between IGFBP2 and HIF1 alpha.","[Lin, Ka Wai; Liao, Angela; Qutub, Amina A.] Rice Univ, Dept Bioengn, Houston, TX 77005 USA","Lin, KW (reprint author), Rice Univ, Dept Bioengn, Houston, TX 77005 USA.",aminaq@rice.edu,,,NSF [1150645],"This work was funded by grant NSF 1150645.

However, different models and model parameterizations may provide different prediction of outcomes. In other fields of research, ensemble modeling has been used to combine multiple projections. We explore the possibility of applying such methods to epidemiology by adapting Bayesian techniques developed for climate forecasting. We exemplify the implementation with single model ensembles based on different parameterizations of the Warwick model run for the 2001 United Kingdom foot and mouth disease outbreak and compare the efficacy of different control actions. This allows us to investigate the effect that discrepancy among projections based on different modeling assumptions has on the ensemble prediction. A sensitivity analysis showed that the choice of prior can have a pronounced effect on the posterior estimates of quantities of interest, in particular for ensembles with large discrepancy among projections. However, by using a hierarchical extension of the method we show that prior sensitivity can be circumvented. We further extend the method to include a priori beliefs about different modeling assumptions and demonstrate that the effect of this can have different consequences depending on the discrepancy among projections.

We developed an approach which goes beyond current inhibitor-inhibitor combination screening to efficiently consider other signaling aspects that may give insights into the behaviour of the platelet as a system. We investigated combinations of platelet inhibitors and activators. We evaluated three distinct strands of information, namely: activator-inhibitor combination screens (testing a panel of inhibitors against a panel of activators); inhibitor-inhibitor synergy screens; and activator-activator synergy screens. We demonstrated how these analyses may be efficiently performed, both experimentally and computationally, to identify particular combinations of most interest. Robust tests of activator-activator synergy and of inhibitor-inhibitor synergy required combinations to show significant excesses over the double doses of each component. Modeling identified multiple effects of an inhibitor of the P2Y12 ADP receptor, and complementarity between inhibitor-inhibitor synergy effects and activator-inhibitor combination effects. This approach accelerates the mapping of combination effects of compounds to develop combinations that may be therapeutically beneficial.

The computation of all feasible metabolic routes with these models, given stoichiometric, thermodynamic, and steady-state constraints, provides important insights into the metabolic capacities of a cell. How the feasible metabolic routes emerge from the interplay between flux constraints, optimality objectives, and the entire metabolic network of a cell is, however, only partially understood. We show how optimal metabolic routes, resulting from flux balance analysis computations, arise out of elementary flux modes, constraints, and optimization objectives. We illustrate our findings with a genome-scale stoichiometric model of Escherichia coli metabolism. In the case of one flux constraint, all feasible optimal flux routes can be derived from elementary flux modes alone. We found up to 120 million of such optimal elementary flux modes. We introduce a new computational method to compute the corner points of the optimal solution space fast and efficiently. Optimal flux routes no longer depend exclusively on elementary flux modes when we impose additional constraints; new optimal metabolic routes arise out of combinations of elementary flux modes. The solution space of feasible metabolic routes shrinks enormously when additional objectives-e.g. those related to pathway expression costs or pathway length-are introduced. In many cases, only a single metabolic route remains that is both feasible and optimal. This paper contributes to reaching a complete topological understanding of the metabolic capacity of organisms in terms of metabolic flux routes, one that is most natural to biochemists and biotechnologists studying and engineering metabolism.","[Maarleveld, Timo R.; Wortel, Meike T.; Olivier, Brett G.; Teusink, Bas; Bruggeman, Frank J.] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam Inst Mol Med & Syst, Syst Bioinformat, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Maarleveld, Timo R.] Ctr Wiskunde & Informat, Life Sci, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Wortel, Meike T.; Teusink, Bas; Bruggeman, Frank J.] Kluyver Ctr Genom Ind Fermentat, Delft, Netherlands","Maarleveld, TR (reprint author), Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam Inst Mol Med & Syst, Syst Bioinformat, Amsterdam, Netherlands.",f.j.bruggeman@vu.nl,"Olivier, Brett G/A-2800-2008","Olivier, Brett G/0000-0002-5293-5321; Wortel, Meike/0000-0002-3191-2710; Teusink, Bas/0000-0003-3929-0423",project BioSolar Cells; Dutch Ministry of Economic Affairs; ZonMW Genomics-Zenith program [40-41009-98-10038]; Nederlandse Organisatie voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek (NWO) VIDI Project [864.11.011],"TRM acknowledges funding from the project BioSolar Cells, co-financed by the Dutch Ministry of Economic Affairs.

However, the stochastic nature of neuronal activity leads to severe biases in the estimation of these oscillations in single unit spike trains. Different biological and experimental factors cause the spike train to differentially reflect its underlying oscillatory rate function. We analyzed the effect of factors, such as the mean firing rate and the recording duration, on the detectability of oscillations and their significance, and tested these theoretical results on experimental data recorded in Parkinsonian non-human primates. The effect of these factors is dramatic, such that in some conditions, the detection of existing oscillations is impossible. Moreover, these biases impede the comparison of oscillations across brain regions, neuronal types, behavioral states and separate recordings with different underlying parameters, and lead inevitably to a gross misinterpretation of experimental results. We introduce a novel objective measure, the ""modulation index"", which overcomes these biases, and enables reliable detection of oscillations from spike trains and a direct estimation of the oscillation magnitude. The modulation index detects a high percentage of oscillations over a wide range of parameters, compared to classical spectral analysis methods, and enables an unbiased comparison between spike trains recorded from different neurons and using different experimental protocols.","[Matzner, Ayala; Bar-Gad, Izhar] Bar Ilan Univ, Leslie & Susan Goldschmied Gonda Multidisciplinar, Ramat Gan, Israel","Matzner, A (reprint author), Bar Ilan Univ, Leslie & Susan Goldschmied Gonda Multidisciplinar, Ramat Gan, Israel.",izhar.bar-gad@biu.ac.il,,"Bar-Gad, Izhar/0000-0002-2999-4083",Israel Science Foundation [743/13],"This study was supported by Israel Science Foundation (www.isf.org.il) grant (743/13) (IBG).

Flexibility plays a key role in DNA supercoiling and DNA/protein binding, regulating DNA transcription, replication or repair. Specific interest in flexibility analysis concerns its relationship with human genome instability. Enrichment in flexible sequences has been detected in unstable regions of human genome defined fragile sites, where genes map and carry frequent deletions and rearrangements in cancer. Flexible sequences have been suggested to be the determinants of fragile gene proneness to breakage; however, their actual role and properties remain elusive. Our in silico analysis carried out genome-wide via the StabFlex algorithm, shows the conserved presence of highly flexible regions in budding yeast genome as well as in genomes of other Saccharomyces sensu stricto species. Flexibile peaks in S. cerevisiae identify 175 ORFs mapping on their 3'UTR, a region affecting mRNA translation, localization and stability. (TA) n repeats of different extension shape the central structure of peaks and co-localize with polyadenylation efficiency element (EE) signals. ORFs with flexible peaks share common features. Transcripts are characterized by decreased half-life: this is considered peculiar of genes involved in regulatory systems with high turnover; consistently, their function affects biological processes such as cell cycle regulation or stress response. Our findings support the functional importance of flexibility peaks, suggesting that the flexible sequence may be derived by an expansion of canonical TAYRTA polyadenylation efficiency element. The flexible (TA) n repeat amplification could be the outcome of an evolutionary neofunctionalization leading to a differential 3'-end processing and expression regulation in genes with peculiar function. Our study provides a new support to the functional role of flexibility in genomes and a strategy for its characterization inside human fragile sites.","[Menconi, Giulia] Univ Pisa, Dipartimento Informat, Largo Pontecorvo, Pisa, Italy; [Menconi, Giulia] Ist Nazl Alta Matemat Francesco Severi, Rome, Italy; [Bedini, Andrea] Univ Melbourne Victoria, Dept Math & Stat, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Barale, Roberto; Sbrana, Isabella] Univ Pisa, Dipartimento Biol, Pisa, Italy","Menconi, G (reprint author), Univ Pisa, Dipartimento Informat, Largo Pontecorvo, Pisa, Italy.",menconi@mail.dm.unipi.it,"; Bedini, Andrea/B-8775-2009","BARALE, Roberto/0000-0003-4161-2241; Bedini, Andrea/0000-0003-4881-1606; MENCONI, GIULIA/0000-0002-9945-5202",,,,58,1,1,0,7,PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE,SAN FRANCISCO,"1160 BATTERY STREET, STE 100, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94111 USA",,1553-7358,,PLOS COMPUT BIOL,PLoS Comput.

One critical step in elucidating this relationship is the identification of governing principles underlying the directionality of interactions between nodes. Here, we demonstrate such principles through analytical solutions based on the phase lead/lag relationships of general oscillator models in networks. We confirm analytical results with computational simulations using general model networks and anatomical brain networks, as well as high-density electroencephalography collected from humans in the conscious and anesthetized states. Analytical, computational, and empirical results demonstrate that network nodes with more connections (i.e., higher degrees) have larger amplitudes and are directional targets (phase lag) rather than sources (phase lead). The relationship of node degree and directionality therefore appears to be a fundamental property of networks, with direct applicability to brain function. These results provide a foundation for a principled understanding of information transfer across networks and also demonstrate that changes in directionality patterns across states of human consciousness are driven by alterations of brain network topology.","[Moon, Joon-Young; Lee, UnCheol; Blain-Moraes, Stefanie] Univ Michigan, Dept Anesthesiol, Sch Med, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Lee, UnCheol] Univ Michigan, Sch Med, Ctr Consciousness Sci, Ann Arbor, MI USA; [Mashour, George A.] Univ Michigan, Dept Anesthesiol, Sch Med, Ctr Consciousness Sci, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Mashour, George A.] Univ Michigan, Sch Med, Grad Program Neurosci, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA","Moon, JY (reprint author), Univ Michigan, Dept Anesthesiol, Sch Med, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",uclee@med.umich.edu,,,"Department of Anesthesiology at the University of Michigan (Ann Arbor); National Institutes of Health (Bethesda, MD, USA) [RO1GM098578]","We acknowledge support from the Department of Anesthesiology at the University of Michigan (Ann Arbor) and National Institutes of Health (Bethesda, MD, USA) grant RO1GM098578 (to GAM).

Recent measurements of morphogen distribution have allowed us to subject this hypothesis to rigorous physical testing. In the early Drosophila embryo, measurements of the morphogen Dorsal, which is a transcription factor responsible for initiating the earliest zygotic patterns along the dorsal-ventral axis, have revealed a gradient that is too narrow to pattern the entire axis. In this study, we use a mathematical model of Dorsal dynamics, fit to experimental data, to determine the ability of the Dorsal gradient to regulate gene expression across the entire dorsal-ventral axis. We found that two assumptions are required for the model to match experimental data in both Dorsal distribution and gene expression patterns. First, we assume that Cactus, an inhibitor that binds to Dorsal and prevents it from entering the nuclei, must itself be present in the nuclei. And second, we assume that fluorescence measurements of Dorsal reflect both free Dorsal and Cactus-bound Dorsal. Our model explains the dynamic behavior of the Dorsal gradient at lateral and dorsal positions of the embryo, the ability of Dorsal to regulate gene expression across the entire dorsal-ventral axis, and the robustness of gene expression to stochastic effects.

An important way to interpret a phylogenetic network is in terms of the trees it displays, which represent all the possible histories of the characters carried by the organisms in the network. Interestingly, however, different networks may display exactly the same set of trees, an observation that poses a problem for network reconstruction: from the perspective of many inference methods such networks are ""indistinguishable"". This is true for all methods that evaluate a phylogenetic network solely on the basis of how well the displayed trees fit the available data, including all methods based on input data consisting of clades, triples, quartets, or trees with any number of taxa, and also sequence-based approaches such as popular formalisations of maximum parsimony and maximum likelihood for networks. This identifiability problem is partially solved by accounting for branch lengths, although this merely reduces the frequency of the problem. Here we propose that network inference methods should only attempt to reconstruct what they can uniquely identify. To this end, we introduce a novel definition of what constitutes a uniquely reconstructible network. For any given set of indistinguishable networks, we define a canonical network that, under mild assumptions, is unique and thus representative of the entire set. Given data that underwent reticulate evolution, only the canonical form of the underlying phylogenetic network can be uniquely reconstructed. While on the methodological side this will imply a drastic reduction of the solution space in network inference, for the study of reticulate evolution this is a fundamental limitation that will require an important change of perspective when interpreting phylogenetic networks.","[Pardi, Fabio] Univ Montpellier, CNRS, UMR 5506, Lab Informat Robot & Microelect Montpellier LIRMM, Montpellier, France; [Scornavacca, Celine] Univ Montpellier, CNRS, UMR 5554, Inst Sci Evolut Montpellier ISE M,IRD, Montpellier, France; [Pardi, Fabio; Scornavacca, Celine] Inst Biol Computat, Montpellier, France","Pardi, F (reprint author), Univ Montpellier, CNRS, UMR 5506, Lab Informat Robot & Microelect Montpellier LIRMM, Montpellier, France.",fabio.pardi@lirmm.fr,,,PEPS BMI grant from the Centre Nationale de la Recherche Scientifique,"This work was funded by a PEPS BMI 2013 grant (http://www.cnrs.fr/mi/spip.php?article315) from the Centre Nationale de la Recherche Scientifique.

In the literature, it is commonly assumed that survival kinetics of starving microbes follows exponential decay. This assumption, however, has not been rigorously tested. Currently, it is not clear under what circumstances this assumption is true. Also, it is not known when such survival kinetics deviates from exponential decay and if it deviates, what underlying mechanisms for the deviation are. Here, to address these issues, we quantitatively characterized dynamics of survival and death of starving E. coli cells. The results show that the assumption - starving cells die exponentially - is true only at high cell density. At low density, starving cells persevere for extended periods of time, before dying rapidly exponentially. Detailed analyses show intriguing quantitative characteristics of the density-dependent and biphasic survival kinetics, including that the period of the perseverance is inversely proportional to cell density. These characteristics further lead us to identification of key underlying processes relevant for the perseverance of starving cells. Then, using mathematical modeling, we show how these processes contribute to the density-dependent and biphasic survival kinetics observed. Importantly, our model reveals a thrifty strategy employed by bacteria, by which upon sensing impending depletion of a substrate, the limiting substrate is conserved and utilized later during starvation to delay cell death. These findings advance quantitative understanding of survival of microbes in oligotrophic environments and facilitate quantitative analysis and prediction of microbial dynamics in nature. Furthermore, they prompt revision of previous models used to analyze and predict population dynamics of microbes.","[Phaiboun, Andy; Zhang, Yiming; Park, Boryung; Kim, Minsu] Emory Univ, Dept Phys, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA; [Kim, Minsu] Emory Univ, Grad Div Biol & Biomed Sci, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA","Phaiboun, A (reprint author), Emory Univ, Dept Phys, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA.",minsu.kim@emory.edu,,,MK's Emory startup,"This work was supported by MK's Emory startup.

Despite their obvious advantages, classical parameterizations require large amounts of data to fit their parameters. Particularly, enzymes displaying complex reaction and regulatory (allosteric) mechanisms require a great number of parameters and are therefore often represented by approximate formulae, thereby facilitating the fitting but ignoring many real kinetic behaviours. Here, we show that full exploration of the plausible kinetic space for any enzyme can be achieved using sampling strategies provided a thermodynamically feasible parameterization is used. To this end, we developed a General Reaction Assembly and Sampling Platform (GRASP) capable of consistently parameterizing and sampling accurate kinetic models using minimal reference data. The former integrates the generalized MWC model and the elementary reaction formalism. By formulating the appropriate thermodynamic constraints, our framework enables parameterization of any oligomeric enzyme kinetics without sacrificing complexity or using simplifying assumptions. This thermodynamically safe parameterization relies on the definition of a reference state upon which feasible parameter sets can be efficiently sampled. Uniform sampling of the kinetics space enabled dissecting enzyme catalysis and revealing the impact of thermodynamics on reaction kinetics. Our analysis distinguished three reaction elasticity regions for common biochemical reactions: a steep linear region (0> Delta G(r) >-2 kJ/mol), a transition region (-2> Delta G(r) >-20 kJ/mol) and a constant elasticity region (0> Delta G(r) <-20 kJ/mol). We also applied this framework to model more complex kinetic behaviours such as the monomeric cooperativity of the mammalian glucokinase and the ultrasensitive response of the phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase of Escherichia coli. In both cases, our approach described appropriately not only the kinetic behaviour of these enzymes, but it also provided insights about the particular features underpinning the observed kinetics. Overall, this framework will enable systematic parameterization and sampling of enzymatic reactions.","[Saa, Pedro; Nielsen, Lars K.] Univ Queensland, Australian Inst Bioengn & Nanotechnol, Brisbane, Qld, Australia","Saa, P (reprint author), Univ Queensland, Australian Inst Bioengn & Nanotechnol, Brisbane, Qld, Australia.",lars.nielsen@uq.edu.au,"Saa, Pedro A./X-1987-2018; Nielsen, Lars K/A-5519-2011","Saa, Pedro A./0000-0002-1659-9041; Nielsen, Lars K/0000-0001-8191-3511",,,,69,10,10,0,13,PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE,SAN FRANCISCO,"1160 BATTERY STREET, STE 100, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94111 USA",1553-734X,1553-7358,,PLOS COMPUT BIOL,PLoS Comput.

Here, we further develop the basic nested effects model using high-content single-cell imaging data from RNAi screens of cultured cells infected with human rhinovirus. RNAi screens with single-cell readouts are becoming increasingly common, and they often reveal high cell-to-cell variation. As a consequence of this cellular heterogeneity, knock-downs result in variable effects among cells and lead to weak average phenotypes on the cell population level. To address this confounding factor in network inference, we explicitly model the stimulation status of a signaling pathway in individual cells. We extend the framework of nested effects models to probabilistic combinatorial knock-downs and propose NEMix, a nested effects mixture model that accounts for unobserved pathway activation. We analyzed the identifiability of NEMix and developed a parameter inference scheme based on the Expectation Maximization algorithm. In an extensive simulation study, we show that NEMix improves learning of pathway structures over classical NEMs significantly in the presence of hidden pathway stimulation. We applied our model to single-cell imaging data from RNAi screens monitoring human rhinovirus infection, where limited infection efficiency of the assay results in uncertain pathway stimulation. Using a subset of genes with known interactions, we show that the inferred NEMix network has high accuracy and outperforms the classical nested effects model without hidden pathway activity.

These measures are of particular interest in the field of hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT). Donor/Recipient suitability for HSCT is determined by Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) similarity. Match predictions rely upon a precise description of HLA diversity, yet classical estimates are inaccurate given the heavy-tailed nature of the distribution. This directly affects HSCT matching and diversity measures in broader fields such as species richness. We, therefore, have developed a power-law based estimator to measure allele and haplotype diversity that accommodates heavy tails using the concepts of regular variation and occupancy distributions. Application of our estimator to 6.59 million donors in the Be The Match Registry revealed that haplotypes follow a heavy tail distribution across all ethnicities: for example, 44.65% of the European American haplotypes are represented by only 1 individual. Indeed, our discovery rate of all U.S. European American haplotypes is estimated at 23.45% based upon sampling 3.97% of the population, leaving a large number of unobserved haplotypes. Population coverage, however, is much higher at 99.4% given that 90% of European Americans carry one of the 4.5% most frequent haplotypes. Alleles were found to be less diverse suggesting the current registry represents most alleles in the population. Thus, for HSCT registries, haplotype discovery will remain high with continued recruitment to a very deep level of sampling, but population coverage will not. Finally, we compared the convergence of our power-law versus classical diversity estimators such as Capture recapture, Chao, ACE and Jackknife methods. When fit to the haplotype data, our estimator displayed favorable properties in terms of convergence (with respect to sampling depth) and accuracy (with respect to diversity estimates). This suggests that power-law based estimators offer a valid alternative to classical diversity estimators and may have broad applicability in the field of population genetics.","[Slater, Noa; Louzoun, Yoram] Bar Ilan Univ, Gonda Brain Res Ctr, Ramat Gan, Israel; [Louzoun, Yoram] Bar Ilan Univ, Dept Math, Ramat Gan, Israel; [Gragert, Loren; Maiers, Martin; Albrecht, Mark] Natl Marrow Donor Program, Minneapolis, MN USA; [Chatterjee, Ansu] Univ Minnesota, Sch Stat, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA","Slater, N (reprint author), Bar Ilan Univ, Gonda Brain Res Ctr, Ramat Gan, Israel.",malbrech@nmdp.org,,,Office of Naval Research [N00014-13-1-0039],"MA, MM, LG, AC were funded by a grant from the Office of Naval Research (Grant number N00014-13-1-0039).

To circumvent this difficulty we have developed a method that identifies cell-state regulators without requiring any markers of differentiation, termed Perturbation-Expression Analysis of Cell States (PEACS). We have applied this marker-free approach to screen for transcription factors that regulate mammary stem cell differentiation in a 3D model of tissue morphogenesis and identified RUNX1 as a stem cell regulator. Inhibition of RUNX1 expanded bipotent stem cells and blocked their differentiation into ductal and lobular tissue rudiments. Reactivation of RUNX1 allowed exit from the bipotent state and subsequent differentiation and mammary morphogenesis. Collectively, our findings show that RUNX1 is required for mammary stem cells to exit a bipotent state, and provide a new method for discovering cell-state regulators when markers are not available.","[Sokol, Ethan S.; Sanduja, Sandhya; Jin, Dexter X.; Miller, Daniel H.; Mathis, Robert A.; Gupta, Piyush B.] Whitehead Inst Biomed Res, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA; [Sokol, Ethan S.; Jin, Dexter X.; Miller, Daniel H.; Mathis, Robert A.; Gupta, Piyush B.] MIT, Dept Biol, Cambridge, MA USA; [Gupta, Piyush B.] MIT, Koch Inst Integrat Canc Res, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Gupta, Piyush B.] Harvard Stem Cell Inst, Cambridge, MA USA","Sokol, ES (reprint author), Whitehead Inst Biomed Res, 9 Cambridge Ctr, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA.",pgupta@wi.mit.edu,,/0000-0002-4866-1145,National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship Program [1122374]; Richard and Susan Smith Family Foundation; Breast Cancer Alliance,"This work was funded by the National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship Program (1122374; ESS), http://www.nsfgrfp.org; the Richard and Susan Smith Family Foundation, http://www.smithfamilyfoundation.net/programs.htm; and the Breast Cancer Alliance, http://breastcanceralliance.org/.

This is achieved via the cell division cycle, which is driven by the sequential accumulation and destruction of cyclins. The regulatory network around these cyclins, particularly in G(1), has been interpreted as a size control network in budding yeast, and cell size as being decisive for the START transition. However, it is not clear why disruptions in the G(1) network may lead to altered size rather than loss of size control, or why the S-G(2)-M duration also depends on nutrients. With a mathematical population model comprised of individually growing cells, we show that cyclin translation would suffice to explain the observed growth rate dependence of cell volume at START. Moreover, we assess the impact of the observed bud-localisation of the G(2) cyclin CLB2 mRNA, and find that localised cyclin translation could provide an efficient mechanism for measuring the biosynthetic capacity in specific compartments: The mother in G(1), and the growing bud in G(2). Hence, iteration of the same principle can ensure that the mother cell is strong enough to grow a bud, and that the bud is strong enough for independent life. Cell sizes emerge in the model, which predicts that a single CDK-cyclin pair per growth phase suffices for size control in budding yeast, despite the necessity of the cell cycle network around the cyclins to integrate other cues. Size control seems to be exerted twice, where the G(2)/M control affects bud size through bud-localized translation of CLB2 mRNA, explaining the dependence of the S-G(2)-M duration on nutrients. Taken together, our findings suggest that cell size is an emergent rather than a regulatory property of the network linking growth and proliferation.","[Spiesser, Thomas W.; Kuehn, Clemens; Krantz, Marcus; Klipp, Edda] Humboldt Univ, Theoret Biophys, D-10099 Berlin, Germany","Spiesser, TW (reprint author), Humboldt Univ, Theoret Biophys, D-10099 Berlin, Germany.",thomas.spiesser@biologie.hu-berlin.de; edda.klipp@biologie.hu-berlin.de,"Kuhn, Clemens/C-2139-2017","Kuhn, Clemens/0000-0002-9853-5307",German Research Council (Research Training Network 1772 Computational Systems Biology); European Commission (SysteMTb) [HEALTH-2010-241587]; German Ministry of Education and Research (e:Bio Cellemental) [FKZ0316193],"This work was supported by the German Research Council (Research Training Network 1772 Computational Systems Biology http://www.berlin-csb.de/) to EK, the European Commission (SysteMTb, HEALTH-2010-241587 http://www.systemtb.org/) to EK, and the German Ministry of Education and Research (e:Bio Cellemental, FKZ0316193 http://www.bmbf.de/) to MK.

Do motor commands encode movement independently or can they be represented in a reduced set of signals (i.e. synergies)? Motor encoding poses a computational and practical challenge because many muscles typically drive movement, and simultaneous electrophysiology recordings of all motor commands are typically not available. Moreover, during a single locomotor period (a stride or wingstroke) the variation in movement may have high dimensionality, even if only a few discrete signals activate the muscles. Here, we apply the method of partial least squares (PLS) to extract the encoded features of movement based on the cross-covariance of motor signals and movement. PLS simultaneously decomposes both datasets and identifies only the variation in movement that relates to the specific muscles of interest. We use this approach to explore how the main downstroke flight muscles of an insect, the hawkmoth Manduca sexta, encode torque during yaw turns. We simultaneously record muscle activity and turning torque in tethered flying moths experiencing wide-field visual stimuli. We ask whether this pair of muscles acts as a muscle synergy (a single linear combination of activity) consistent with their hypothesized function of producing a left-right power differential. Alternatively, each muscle might individually encode variation in movement. We show that PLS feature analysis produces an efficient reduction of dimensionality in torque variation within a wingstroke. At first, the two muscles appear to behave as a synergy when we consider only their wingstroke-averaged torque. However, when we consider the PLS features, the muscles reveal independent encoding of torque. Using these features we can predictably reconstruct the variation in torque corresponding to changes in muscle activation. PLS-based feature analysis provides a general two-sided dimensionality reduction that reveals encoding in high dimensional sensory or motor transformations.","[Sponberg, Simon; Daniel, Thomas L.] Univ Washington, Dept Biol, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Sponberg, Simon; Fairhall, Adrienne L.] Univ Washington, Dept Physiol & Biophys, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Daniel, Thomas L.; Fairhall, Adrienne L.] Univ Washington, Inst Neuroengn, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Daniel, Thomas L.; Fairhall, Adrienne L.] Univ Washington, Program Neurosci, Seattle, WA 98195 USA","Sponberg, S (reprint author), Georgia Inst Technol, Sch Phys, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA.",Sponberg@gatech.edu,,,"National Science Foundation Biological Informatics Postdoctoral Fellowship [0905944]; Komen Endowed Chair, Office of Naval Research MURI [N000141010952]; National Science Foundation [EEC-1028725]; Air Force Office of Scientific Research [FA9550-11-1-0155]; Allen Family Foundation","This work was supported by National Science Foundation Biological Informatics Postdoctoral Fellowship (http://www.nsf.gov/funding/pgm_summ.jsp?pims_id=503622&org=NSF) 0905944 to SS as well as the Komen Endowed Chair, Office of Naval Research ( www.onr.navy.mil) MURI grant N000141010952, National Science Foundation ( http://www.nsf.gov/dir/index.jsp?org=BIO) grant EEC-1028725, and Air Force Office of Scientific Research (www.afosr.af.mil) grant FA9550-11-1-0155 to TLD and an Allen Family Foundation grant to ALF.

It is therefore vital that research biologists acquire the necessary skills during their training to visualize, analyze, and interpret such data. To begin to meet this need, we have developed a ""boot camp"" in quantitative methods for biology graduate students at Harvard Medical School. The goal of this short, intensive course is to enable students to use computational tools to visualize and analyze data, to strengthen their computational thinking skills, and to simulate and thus extend their intuition about the behavior of complex biological systems. The boot camp teaches basic programming using biological examples from statistics, image processing, and data analysis. This integrative approach to teaching programming and quantitative reasoning motivates students' engagement by demonstrating the relevance of these skills to their work in life science laboratories. Students also have the opportunity to analyze their own data or explore a topic of interest in more detail. The class is taught with a mixture of short lectures, Socratic discussion, and in-class exercises. Students spend approximately 40% of their class time working through both short and long problems. A high instructor-to-student ratio allows students to get assistance or additional challenges when needed, thus enhancing the experience for students at all levels of mastery. Data collected from end-of-course surveys from the last five offerings of the course (between 2012 and 2014) show that students report high learning gains and feel that the course prepares them for solving quantitative and computational problems they will encounter in their research.

The spatial range of cytokine communication is a crucial, yet poorly understood, functional property. Both containment of cytokine action in narrow junctions between immune cells (immunological synapses) and global signaling throughout entire lymph nodes have been proposed, but the conditions under which they might occur are not clear. Here we analyze spatially three-dimensional reaction-diffusion models for the dynamics of cytokine signaling at two successive scales: in immunological synapses and in dense multicellular environments. For realistic parameter values, we observe local spatial gradients, with the cytokine concentration around secreting cells decaying sharply across only a few cell diameters. Focusing on the well-characterized T-cell cytokine interleukin-2, we show how cytokine secretion and competitive uptake determine this signaling range. Uptake is shaped locally by the geometry of the immunological synapse. However, even for narrow synapses, which favor intrasynaptic cytokine consumption, escape fluxes into the extrasynaptic space are expected to be substantial (>= 20% of secretion). Hence paracrine signaling will generally extend beyond the synapse but can be limited to cellular microenvironments through uptake by target cells or strong competitors, such as regulatory T cells. By contrast, long-range cytokine signaling requires a high density of cytokine producers or weak consumption (e.g., by sparsely distributed target cells). Thus in a physiological setting, cytokine gradients between cells, and not bulk-phase concentrations, are crucial for cell-to-cell communication, emphasizing the need for spatially resolved data on cytokine signaling.","[Thurley, Kevin; Hoefer, Thomas] German Canc Res Ctr, Div Theoret Syst Biol, Heidelberg, Germany; [Thurley, Kevin] Charite, Inst Theoret Biol, D-13353 Berlin, Germany; [Thurley, Kevin] Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Pharmaceut Chem, San Francisco, CA USA; [Gerecht, Daniel; Friedmann, Elfriede] Heidelberg Univ, Inst Appl Math, Heidelberg, Germany; [Hoefer, Thomas] Heidelberg Univ, Bioquant Ctr, Heidelberg, Germany","Thurley, K (reprint author), German Canc Res Ctr, Div Theoret Syst Biol, Heidelberg, Germany.",kevin.thurley@ucsf.edu; daniel.gerecht@iwr.uni-heidelberg.de; friedmann@iwr.uni-heidelberg.de; t.hoefer@dkfz.de,"Hofer, Thomas/G-5665-2013","Hofer, Thomas/0000-0003-3560-8780","Helmholtz Aliance on Systems Biology (SB Cancer, Submodule V.7); ViroQuant consortium","Part of the numerical work was supported by the Helmholtz Aliance on Systems Biology (SB Cancer, Submodule V.7; http://www.dkfz.de/en/sbcancer/index.html) and the ViroQuant consortium (http://www.viroquant.uni-hd.de/).

Here we developed a theoretical approach to predict the effect of mutations on protein stability from non-equilibrium unfolding simulations. We establish a relative measure based on apparent simulated melting temperatures that is independent of simulation length and, under certain assumptions, proportional to equilibrium stability, and we justify this theoretical development with extensive simulations and experimental data. Using our new method based on all-atom Monte-Carlo unfolding simulations, we carried out a saturating mutagenesis of Dihydrofolate Reductase (DHFR), a key target of antibiotics and chemotherapeutic drugs. The method predicted more than 500 stabilizing mutations, several of which were selected for detailed computational and experimental analysis. We find a highly significant correlation of r = 0.65-0.68 between predicted and experimentally determined melting temperatures and unfolding denaturant concentrations for WT DHFR and 42 mutants. The correlation between energy of the native state and experimental denaturation temperature was much weaker, indicating the important role of entropy in protein stability. The most stabilizing point mutation was D27F, which is located in the active site of the protein, rendering it inactive. However for the rest of mutations outside of the active site we observed a weak yet statistically significant positive correlation between thermal stability and catalytic activity indicating the lack of a stability-activity tradeoff for DHFR. By combining stabilizing mutations predicted by our method, we created a highly stable catalytically active E. coli DHFR mutant with measured denaturation temperature 7.2 degrees C higher than WT. Prediction results for DHFR and several other proteins indicate that computational approaches based on unfolding simulations are useful as a general technique to discover stabilizing mutations.","[Tian, Jian; Whitney, Anna; Shakhnovich, Eugene I.] Harvard Univ, Dept Chem & Chem Biol, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Tian, Jian] Chinese Acad Agr Sci, Biotechnol Res Inst, Beijing 100193, Peoples R China; [Woodard, Jaie C.] Harvard Univ, Grad Program Biophys, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA","Tian, J (reprint author), Harvard Univ, Dept Chem & Chem Biol, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",shakhnovich@chemistry.harvard.edu,"Tian, Jian/D-1052-2011","Tian, Jian/0000-0002-9997-6518",NIH [RO1 GM06870]; NIH Biophysics training grant; National High Technology Research and Development Program of China (863 Program) [2013AA102804]; National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [31371748],"This work was supported by NIH grant RO1 GM06870 (EIS) www.nih.gov; NIH Biophysics training grant (JCW) www.nih.gov; National High Technology Research and Development Program of China (863 Program, 2013AA102804) http://www.most.gov.cn/eng/programmes1/200610/t20061009_36225.htm; and the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC, Grant no. 31371748) (JT) http://www.nsfc.gov.cn.

To understand the process of protein glycosylation, the reaction mechanisms of the participating enzymes need to be known. However, the reaction mechanism of retaining glycosyltransferases has not yet been sufficiently explained. Here we investigated the catalytic mechanism of human isoform 2 of the retaining glycosyltransferase polypeptide UDP-GalNAc transferase by coupling two different QM/MM-based approaches, namely a potential energy surface scan in two distance difference dimensions and a minimum energy reaction path optimisation using the Nudged Elastic Band method. Potential energy scan studies often suffer from inadequate sampling of reactive processes due to a predefined scan coordinate system. At the same time, path optimisation methods enable the sampling of a virtually unlimited number of dimensions, but their results cannot be unambiguously interpreted without knowledge of the potential energy surface. By combining these methods, we have been able to eliminate the most significant sources of potential errors inherent to each of these approaches. The structural model is based on the crystal structure of human isoform 2. In the QM/MM method, the QM region consists of 275 atoms, the remaining 5776 atoms were in the MM region. We found that ppGalNAcT2 catalyzes a same-face nucleophilic substitution with internal return (SNi). The optimized transition state for the reaction is 13.8 kcal/mol higher in energy than the reactant while the energy of the product complex is 6.7 kcal/mol lower. During the process of nucleophilic attack, a proton is synchronously transferred to the leaving phosphate. The presence of a short-lived metastable oxocarbenium intermediate is likely, as indicated by the reaction energy profiles obtained using high-level density functionals.","[Trnka, Tomas; Kozmon, Stanislav; Tvaroska, Igor; Koca, Jaroslav] Masaryk Univ, Cent European Inst Technol CEITEC, Brno, Czech Republic; [Trnka, Tomas; Kozmon, Stanislav; Koca, Jaroslav] Masaryk Univ, Fac Sci, Natl Ctr Biomol Res, CS-61137 Brno, Czech Republic; [Tvaroska, Igor] Slovak Acad Sci, Inst Chem, Bratislava, Slovakia","Trnka, T (reprint author), Masaryk Univ, Cent European Inst Technol CEITEC, Brno, Czech Republic.",jkoca@ceitec.cz,"Kozmon, Stanislav/D-8525-2012; Koca, Jaroslav/E-4460-2012","Kozmon, Stanislav/0000-0002-0946-3453; Koca, Jaroslav/0000-0002-2780-4901; Trnka, Tomas/0000-0002-9273-3820","European Union [CZ.1.05/1.1.00/02.0068, 286154]; Ministry of Education of the Czech Republic [LH13055]; Brno City Municipality through the Brno Ph.D. Talent programme; Scientific Grant Agency of the Ministry of Education of Slovak Republic and Slovak Academy of Sciences [VEGA-02/0159/12]; MetaCentrum under the programme ""Projects of Large Infrastructure for Research, Development, and Innovations"" [LM2010005]; OP VaVpI project [CZ.1.05/1.1.00/02.0070]","The research leading to these results obtained financial contribution from the European Union under the Seventh Framework Programme (http://cordis.europa.eu/fp7/home_en.html) by CEITEC (CZ.1.05/1.1.00/02.0068 - TT, JK) project from European Regional Development Fund and SYLICA (Contract No. 286154 under ""Capacities"" specific programme - SK, IT) and the Ministry of Education of the Czech Republic (LH13055, http://www.msmt.cz/ - TT, JK).

We analyzed human brain activity patterns from 148 studies of emotion categories (2159 total participants) using a novel hierarchical Bayesian model. The model allowed us to classify which of five categories-fear, anger, disgust, sadness, or happiness-is engaged by a study with 66% accuracy (43-86% across categories). Analyses of the activity patterns encoded in the model revealed that each emotion category is associated with unique, prototypical patterns of activity across multiple brain systems including the cortex, thalamus, amygdala, and other structures. The results indicate that emotion categories are not contained within any one region or system, but are represented as configurations across multiple brain networks. The model provides a precise summary of the prototypical patterns for each emotion category, and demonstrates that a sufficient characterization of emotion categories relies on (a) differential patterns of involvement in neocortical systems that differ between humans and other species, and (b) distinctive patterns of cortical-subcortical interactions. Thus, these findings are incompatible with several contemporary theories of emotion, including those that emphasize emotion-dedicated brain systems and those that propose emotion is localized primarily in subcortical activity. They are consistent with componential and constructionist views, which propose that emotions are differentiated by a combination of perceptual, mnemonic, prospective, and motivational elements. Such brain-based models of emotion provide a foundation for new translational and clinical approaches.","[Wager, Tor D.] Univ Colorado, Dept Psychol & Neurosci, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; [Wager, Tor D.] Univ Colorado, Inst Cognit Sci, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; [Kang, Jian] Emory Univ, Dept Radiol & Imaging Sci, Dept Biostat & Bioinformat, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA; [Johnson, Timothy D.] Univ Michigan, Dept Biostat, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Nichols, Thomas E.] Univ Warwick, Dept Stat, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England; [Nichols, Thomas E.] Univ Warwick, Warwick Mfg Grp, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England; [Nichols, Thomas E.] Univ Oxford, Nuffield Dept Clin Neurosci, Funct Magnet Resonance Imaging Brain FMRIB Ctr, Oxford, England; [Satpute, Ajay B.; Barrett, Lisa Feldman] Northeastern Univ, Dept Psychol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Barrett, Lisa Feldman] Harvard Univ, Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Sch Med, Boston, MA USA","Wager, TD (reprint author), Univ Colorado, Dept Psychol & Neurosci, Boulder, CO 80309 USA.",tor.wager@colorado.edu,"Satpute, Ajay/I-8845-2019","Satpute, Ajay/0000-0003-0227-0816; Kang, Jian/0000-0002-5643-2668","U.S. Army Research Institute for the Behavioral and Social Sciences [W5J9CQ-11-C-0046]; TDW, a National Institutes of Health Director's Pioneer Award [DP1OD003312, R01MH076136, R01-NS-075066]; Medical Research Council [G0900908]","This research was supported by the U.S. Army Research Institute for the Behavioral and Social Sciences (contract W5J9CQ-11-C-0046) [https://sslweb.hqda.pentagon.mil/ari/] to LFB and TDW, a National Institutes of Health Director's Pioneer Award (DP1OD003312) [http://commonfund.nih.gov/pioneer/index] to LFB, R01MH076136 to TDW, and R01-NS-075066 to TDJ The funders had no role in study design, data collection and analysis, decision to publish, or preparation of the manuscript.",,109,63,63,1,38,PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE,SAN FRANCISCO,"1160 BATTERY STREET, STE 100, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94111 USA",1553-734X,1553-7358,,PLOS COMPUT BIOL,PLoS Comput.

The transition from tumor suppression to tumor promotion is mediated by a tumor-induced shift in the local immune state, and despite the clinical challenge this shift poses, little is known about how such dysfunctional immune states are initiated. Clinical and experimental observations have indicated that differences in both the composition and spatial distribution of different cell types and/or signaling molecules within the tumor microenvironment can strongly impact tumor pathogenesis and ultimately patient prognosis. How such ""functional"" and ""spatial"" heterogeneities confer such effects, however, is not known. To investigate these phenomena at a level currently inaccessible by direct observation, we developed a computational model of a nascent metastatic tumor capturing salient features of known tumor-immune interactions that faithfully recapitulates key features of existing experimental observations. Surprisingly, over a wide range of model formulations, we observed that heterogeneity in both spatial organization and cell phenotype drove the emergence of immunosuppressive network states. We determined that this observation is general and robust to parameter choice by developing a systems-level sensitivity analysis technique, and we extended this analysis to generate other parameter-independent, experimentally testable hypotheses. Lastly, we leveraged this model as an in silico test bed to evaluate potential strategies for engineering cell-based therapies to overcome tumor associated immune dysfunction and thereby identified modes of immune modulation predicted to be most effective. Collectively, this work establishes a new integrated framework for investigating and modulating tumor-immune networks and provides insights into how such interactions may shape early stages of tumor formation.","[Wells, Daniel K.; Brockmann, Dirk; Kath, William L.] Northwestern Univ, Dept Engn Sci & Appl Math, Evanston, IL 60208 USA; [Wells, Daniel K.; Brockmann, Dirk; Kath, William L.; Leonard, Joshua N.] Northwestern Univ, Phys Sci Oncol Ctr, Evanston, IL 60208 USA; [Chuang, Yishan; Knapp, Louis M.; Leonard, Joshua N.] Northwestern Univ, Dept Chem & Biol Engn, Evanston, IL 60208 USA; [Brockmann, Dirk; Kath, William L.] Northwestern Univ, Robert H Lurie Comprehens Canc Ctr, Evanston, IL 60208 USA; [Brockmann, Dirk; Kath, William L.] Northwestern Univ, Northwestern Inst Complex Sci, Evanston, IL 60208 USA; [Brockmann, Dirk] Humboldt Univ, Inst Theoret Biol, D-10099 Berlin, Germany; [Kath, William L.; Leonard, Joshua N.] Northwestern Univ, Chem Life Proc Inst, Evanston, IL 60208 USA","Wells, DK (reprint author), Northwestern Univ, Dept Engn Sci & Appl Math, Evanston, IL 60208 USA.",j-leonard@northwestern.edu,"Leonard, Joshua/B-7649-2009; Kath, William/B-6771-2009","Leonard, Joshua/0000-0003-4359-6126",NSF graduate research fellowship; Chicago Biomedical Consortium; Northwestern University Physical Sciences-Oncology Center through National Institutes of Health [U54 CA143869-05],"DKW was supported by an NSF graduate research fellowship (www.nsf.gov) and a fellowship from the Chicago Biomedical Consortium (http://www.chicagobiomedicalconsortium.org).

One popular method, known as maximally informative dimensions (MID), uses an information-theoretic quantity known as ""single-spike information"" to identify this space. Here we examine MID from a model-based perspective. We show that MID is a maximum-likelihood estimator for the parameters of a linear-nonlinear-Poisson (LNP) model, and that the empirical single-spike information corresponds to the normalized log-likelihood under a Poisson model. This equivalence implies that MID does not necessarily find maximally informative stimulus dimensions when spiking is not well described as Poisson. We provide several examples to illustrate this shortcoming, and derive a lower bound on the information lost when spiking is Bernoulli in discrete time bins. To overcome this limitation, we introduce model-based dimensionality reduction methods for neurons with non-Poisson firing statistics, and show that they can be framed equivalently in likelihood-based or information-theoretic terms. Finally, we show how to overcome practical limitations on the number of stimulus dimensions that MID can estimate by constraining the form of the non-parametric nonlinearity in an LNP model. We illustrate these methods with simulations and data from primate visual cortex.","[Williamson, Ross S.; Sahani, Maneesh] UCL, Gatsby Computat Neurosci Unit, London, England; [Williamson, Ross S.] UCL, Ctr Math & Phys Life Sci & Expt Biol, London, England; [Pillow, Jonathan W.] Princeton Univ, Dept Psychol, Princeton Neurosci Inst, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA","Williamson, RS (reprint author), Massachusetts Eye & Ear Infirm, Eaton Peabody Labs, Boston, MA 02114 USA.",ross_williamson@meei.harvard.edu; pillow@princeton.edu,,"Pillow, Jonathan/0000-0002-3638-8831",Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council; Gatsby Charitable Foundation; Sloan Fellowship; McKnight Scholar's award; NSF CAREER award [IIS-1150186],"This work was supported by the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (support for RSW through the CoMPLEX Doctoral Training Program), the Gatsby Charitable Foundation (Gatsby Computational Neuroscience Unit support to RSW and MS) and Sloan Fellowship, McKnight Scholar's award, and NSF CAREER award IIS-1150186 (support to JWP).

We illustrate our method's potential to find intervention targets for cancer treatment and cell differentiation by applying it to a leukemia signaling network and to the network controlling the differentiation of helper T cells.

Increasingly, the capacity for high-throughput experimentation provided by new imaging modalities, contrast techniques, microscopy tools, microfluidics and computer controlled systems shifts the experimental bottleneck from the level of physical manipulation and raw data collection to automated recognition and data processing. Yet, despite their broad importance, image analysis solutions to address these needs have been narrowly tailored. Here, we present a generalizable formulation for autonomous identification of specific biological structures that is applicable for many problems. The process flow architecture we present here utilizes standard image processing techniques and the multi-tiered application of classification models such as support vector machines (SVM). These low-level functions are readily available in a large array of image processing software packages and programming languages. Our framework is thus both easy to implement at the modular level and provides specific high-level architecture to guide the solution of more complicated image-processing problems. We demonstrate the utility of the classification routine by developing two specific classifiers as a toolset for automation and cell identification in the model organism Caenorhabditis elegans. To serve a common need for automated high-resolution imaging and behavior applications in the C. elegans research community, we contribute a ready-to-use classifier for the identification of the head of the animal under bright field imaging. Furthermore, we extend our framework to address the pervasive problem of cell-specific identification under fluorescent imaging, which is critical for biological investigation in multicellular organisms or tissues. Using these examples as a guide, we envision the broad utility of the framework for diverse problems across different length scales and imaging methods.","[Zhan, Mei; Crane, Matthew M.; Lu, Hang] Georgia Inst Technol, Interdisciplinary Program Bioengn, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA; [Zhan, Mei; Lu, Hang] Georgia Inst Technol, Wallace H Coulter Dept Biomed Engn, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA; [Entchev, Eugeni V.; Caballero, Antonio; de Abreu, Diana Andrea Fernandes; Ch'ng, QueeLim] Kings Coll London, MRC Ctr Dev Neurobiol, London WC2R 2LS, England; [Lu, Hang] Georgia Inst Technol, Sch Chem & Biomol Engn, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA","Zhan, M (reprint author), Georgia Inst Technol, Interdisciplinary Program Bioengn, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA.",hang.lu@gatech.edu,"Ch'ng, QueeLim/C-5348-2009; Caballero, Antonio/I-8510-2014","Ch'ng, QueeLim/0000-0003-1941-3828; Entchev, Eugeni/0000-0003-0744-5929; Caballero, Antonio/0000-0001-6042-9245","US National Institutes of Health [R01AG035317, R01GM088333, R21EB012803]; US National Science Foundation [CBET 0954578, 0946809]; Wellcome Trust [087146]; European Research Council [NeuroAge 242666]; Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council [BB/H020500/1]; Medical Research Council [G0901899]","This work is partially supported by funding from the US National Institutes of Health (R01AG035317, R01GM088333, and R21EB012803 to HL), the US National Science Foundation (CBET 0954578 to HL, graduate research fellowships 0946809 to MZ and MMC), Wellcome Trust (Project Grant 087146 to QC), and European Research Council (NeuroAge 242666 to QC).

We quantified the statistical energy landscapes for binding, from which we can characterize the distributions of the binding free energy (affinity), the equilibrium constants, the kinetics and the specificity by exploring the different ligands binding with a particular receptor. The results of the analytical studies are confirmed by the microscopic flexible docking simulations. The distribution of binding affinity is Gaussian around the mean and becomes exponential near the tail. The equilibrium constants of the binding follow a log-normal distribution around the mean and a power law distribution in the tail. The intrinsic specificity for biomolecular recognition measures the degree of discrimination of native versus non-native binding and the optimization of which becomes the maximization of the ratio of the free energy gap between the native state and the average of non-native states versus the roughness measured by the variance of the free energy landscape around its mean. The intrinsic specificity obeys a Gaussian distribution near the mean and an exponential distribution near the tail. Furthermore, the kinetics of binding follows a log-normal distribution near the mean and a power law distribution at the tail. Our study provides new insights into the statistical nature of thermodynamics, kinetics and function from different ligands binding with a specific receptor or equivalently specific ligand binding with different receptors.

The march of progress has been rapid, leaving in its wake a demand for courses in data analysis, data stewardship, computing fundamentals, etc., a need that universities have not yet been able to satisfy-paradoxically, many are actually closing ""niche"" bioinformatics courses at a time of critical need. The impact of this is being felt across continents, as many students and early-stage researchers are being left without appropriate skills to manage, analyse, and interpret their data with confidence. This situation has galvanised a group of scientists to address the problems on an international scale.

Medium spiny neurons (MSNs) in the striatum, receiving input from cortex and projecting to the direct and indirect pathways express D1 and D2 type dopamine receptors, respectively. Recently, it has become clear that the two types of MSNs markedly differ in their mutual and recurrent connectivities as well as feedforward inhibition from FSIs. Therefore, to understand striatal function in action selection, it is of key importance to identify the role of the distinct connectivities within and between the two types of MSNs on the balance of their activity. Here, we used both a reduced firing rate model and numerical simulations of a spiking network model of the striatum to analyze the dynamic balance of spiking activities in D1 and D2 MSNs. We show that the asymmetric connectivity of the two types of MSNs renders the striatum into a threshold device, indicating the state of cortical input rates and correlations by the relative activity rates of D1 and D2 MSNs. Next, we describe how this striatal threshold can be effectively modulated by the activity of fast spiking interneurons, by the dopamine level, and by the activity of the GPe via pallidostriatal backprojections. We show that multiple mechanisms exist in the basal ganglia for biasing striatal output in favour of either the 'Go' or the 'No-Go' pathway. This new understanding of striatal network dynamics provides novel insights into the putative role of the striatum in various behavioral deficits in patients with Parkinson's disease, including increased reaction times, L-Dopa-induced dyskinesia, and deep brain stimulation-induced impulsivity.","[Bahuguna, Jyotika; Aertsen, Ad; Kumar, Arvind] Univ Freiburg, Bernstein Ctr Freiburg, D-79106 Freiburg, Germany; [Bahuguna, Jyotika; Aertsen, Ad; Kumar, Arvind] Univ Freiburg, Fac Biol, D-79106 Freiburg, Germany; [Bahuguna, Jyotika; Kumar, Arvind] KTH Royal Inst Technol, Sch Comp Sci & Commun, Computat Biol, Stockholm, Sweden","Bahuguna, J (reprint author), Univ Freiburg, Bernstein Ctr Freiburg, Hugstetter Str 55, D-79106 Freiburg, Germany.",jyotika.bahuguna@bcf.uni-freiburg.de; arvkumar@kth.se,,"Bahuguna, Jyotika/0000-0002-2858-5325; Kumar, Arvind/0000-0002-8044-9195","German Federal Ministry of Education and Research [BMBF 01GQ0420, 01GQ0830]; BrainLinks-BrainTools Cluster of Excellence - German Research Foundation (DFG) [EXC 1086]; EU (INTERREG-V Grant); German-Israeli Foundation; INTERREG IV Rhin superieur program and european funds for regional development (FEDER) [TIGER A31]; Albert Ludwigs University Freiburg","This work was supported by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF 01GQ0420 to BCCN Freiburg and 01GQ0830 to BFNT Freiburg/Tubingen), the BrainLinks-BrainTools Cluster of Excellence funded by the German Research Foundation (DFG #EXC 1086), the EU (INTERREG-V Grant to Neurex: TriNeuron) and the German-Israeli Foundation.

In an extensive investigation of a rich set of data collected from RV144 vaccine recipients, we here employ machine learning methods to identify and model associations between antibody features (IgG subclass and antigen specificity) and effector function activities (antibody dependent cellular phagocytosis, cellular cytotoxicity, and cytokine release).

It is a dynamic process that occurs at multiple spatial scales from macromolecular dynamics, to cell deformations, mitosis and apoptosis, to coordinated cell rearrangements that lead to global changes of tissue shape. Using time lapse imaging, it is possible to observe these events at a system level. However, to investigate morphogenetic events it is necessary to develop computational tools to extract quantitative information from the time lapse data. Toward this goal, we developed an image-based computational pipeline to preprocess, segment and track epithelial cells in 4D confocal microscopy data. The computational pipeline we developed, for the first time, detects the adherens junctions of epithelial cells in 3D, without the need to first detect cell nuclei. We accentuate and detect cell outlines in a series of steps, symbolically describe the cells and their connectivity, and employ this information to track the cells. We validated the performance of the pipeline for its ability to detect vertices and cell-cell contacts, track cells, and identify mitosis and apoptosis in surface epithelia of Drosophila imaginal discs. We demonstrate the utility of the pipeline to extract key quantitative features of cell behavior with which to elucidate the dynamics and biomechanical control of epithelial tissue morphogenesis.

However, although various methods for gene and gene-set analysis currently exist, they generally suffer from a number of issues. Statistical power for most methods is strongly affected by linkage disequilibrium between markers, multi-marker associations are often hard to detect, and the reliance on permutation to compute p-values tends to make the analysis computationally very expensive. To address these issues we have developed MAGMA, a novel tool for gene and gene-set analysis. The gene analysis is based on a multiple regression model, to provide better statistical performance. The gene-set analysis is built as a separate layer around the gene analysis for additional flexibility. This gene-set analysis also uses a regression structure to allow generalization to analysis of continuous properties of genes and simultaneous analysis of multiple gene sets and other gene properties. Simulations and an analysis of Crohn's Disease data are used to evaluate the performance of MAGMA and to compare it to a number of other gene and gene-set analysis tools. The results show that MAGMA has significantly more power than other tools for both the gene and the gene-set analysis, identifying more genes and gene sets associated with Crohn's Disease while maintaining a correct type 1 error rate. Moreover, the MAGMA analysis of the Crohn's Disease data was found to be considerably faster as well.","[de Leeuw, Christiaan A.; Posthuma, Danielle] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Ctr Neurogen & Cognit Res, Dept Complex Trait Genet, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [de Leeuw, Christiaan A.; Heskes, Tom] Radboud Univ Nijmegen, Inst Comp & Informat Sci, NL-6525 ED Nijmegen, Netherlands; [Mooij, Joris M.] Univ Amsterdam, Inst Informat, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Posthuma, Danielle] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Med Ctr Amsterdam, Dept Clin Genet, Amsterdam, Netherlands","de Leeuw, CA (reprint author), Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Ctr Neurogen & Cognit Res, Dept Complex Trait Genet, Amsterdam, Netherlands.",c.a.deleeuw@vu.nl,"Heskes, Tom/A-1443-2010","Heskes, Tom/0000-0002-3398-5235; Posthuma, Danielle/0000-0001-7582-2365",Complexity project of the Netherlands Scientific Organisation [NWO 645-000-003]; Netherlands Scientific Organisation [NWO 480-05-003],"This study was conducted as part of the Complexity project of the Netherlands Scientific Organisation (www.nwo.nl), grant NWO 645-000-003 (DP, TH).

In the artificial intelligence subfield of neural networks, a barrier to that goal is that when agents learn a new skill they typically do so by losing previously acquired skills, a problem called catastrophic forgetting. That occurs because, to learn the new task, neural learning algorithms change connections that encode previously acquired skills. How networks are organized critically affects their learning dynamics. In this paper, we test whether catastrophic forgetting can be reduced by evolving modular neural networks. Modularity intuitively should reduce learning interference between tasks by separating functionality into physically distinct modules in which learning can be selectively turned on or off. Modularity can further improve learning by having a reinforcement learning module separate from sensory processing modules, allowing learning to happen only in response to a positive or negative reward. In this paper, learning takes place via neuromodulation, which allows agents to selectively change the rate of learning for each neural connection based on environmental stimuli (e.g. to alter learning in specific locations based on the task at hand). To produce modularity, we evolve neural networks with a cost for neural connections. We show that this connection cost technique causes modularity, confirming a previous result, and that such sparsely connected, modular networks have higher overall performance because they learn new skills faster while retaining old skills more and because they have a separate reinforcement learning module. Our results suggest (1) that encouraging modularity in neural networks may help us overcome the long-standing barrier of networks that cannot learn new skills without forgetting old ones, and (2) that one benefit of the modularity ubiquitous in the brains of natural animals might be to alleviate the problem of catastrophic forgetting.","[Ellefsen, Kai Olav] Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Comp & Informat Sci, N-7034 Trondheim, Norway; [Mouret, Jean-Baptiste] Univ Paris 06, Sorbonne Univ, UMR 7222, ISIR, Paris, France; [Mouret, Jean-Baptiste] CNRS, UMR 7222, ISIR, Paris, France; [Clune, Jeff] Univ Wyoming, Dept Comp Sci, Laramie, WY 82071 USA","Ellefsen, KO (reprint author), Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Comp & Informat Sci, N-7034 Trondheim, Norway.",jeffclune@uwyo.edu,"Mouret, Jean Baptiste/B-5166-2019","Mouret, Jean Baptiste/0000-0002-2513-027X; Ellefsen, Kai Olav/0000-0003-2466-2319",ANR young researchers grant (Creadapt) [ANR-12-JS03-0009],"KOE and JC have no specific financial support for this work.

The degree to which individual neuronal input-output functions are modulated by voltage fluctuations, however, is not well established across different cortical areas. Additionally, the extent and mechanisms of input-output modulation through fluctuations have been explored largely in simplified models of spike generation, and with limited consideration for the role of non-linear and voltage-dependent membrane properties. To address these issues, we studied fluctuation-based modulation of input-output responses in medial entorhinal cortical (MEC) stellate cells of rats, which express strong sub-threshold non-linear membrane properties. Using in vitro recordings, dynamic clamp and modeling, we show that the modulation of input-output responses by random voltage fluctuations in stellate cells is significantly limited. In stellate cells, a voltage-dependent increase in membrane resistance at sub-threshold voltages mediated by Na+ conductance activation limits the ability of fluctuations to elicit spikes. Similarly, in exponential leaky integrate-and-fire models using a shallow voltage-dependence for the exponential term that matches stellate cell membrane properties, a low degree of fluctuation-based modulation of input-output responses can be attained. These results demonstrate that fluctuation-based modulation of input-output responses is not a universal feature of neurons and can be significantly limited by subthreshold voltage-gated conductances.","[Fernandez, Fernando R.; Malerba, Paola; White, John A.] Univ Utah, Dept Bioengn, Salt Lake City, UT 84112 USA","Fernandez, FR (reprint author), Univ Utah, Dept Bioengn, Salt Lake City, UT 84112 USA.",f.fernandez@utah.edu,"Fernandez, Fernando/G-9398-2018","Fernandez, Fernando/0000-0001-9308-3594; Malerba, Paola/0000-0002-8733-899X","National Institutes of Health [R01MH085074, R01EB016407, R03MH103728]","This work was supported with grants from the National Institutes of Health (R01MH085074 (JAW), R01EB016407 (JAW) and R03MH103728 (FRF)).

The impact of the 7-valent PCV on all-serotype invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) among children was reported to vary between high-income countries. We investigate the ability to predict this heterogeneity from pre-vaccination data. We propose a parsimonious model that predicts the impact of PCVs from the odds of vaccine serotype (VT) among carriers and IPD cases in the pre-PCV period, assuming that VT are eliminated in a mature PCV programme, that full serotype replacement occurs in carriage and that invasiveness of the NVT group is unchanged. We test model performance against the reported impact of PCV7 on childhood IPD in high-income countries from a recent meta-analysis. The odds of pre-PCV7 VT IPD, PCV schedule, PCV coverage and whether a catch up campaign was used for introduction was gathered from the same analysis. We conducted a literature review and meta-analysis to obtain the odds of pre-PCV7 VT carriage in the respective settings. The model predicted the reported impact on childhood IPD of mature PCV programmes; the ratio of predicted and observed incidence risk ratios was close to 1 in all settings. In the high income settings studied differences in schedule, coverage, and catch up campaigns were not associated with the observed heterogeneity in impact of PCV7 on childhood all-serotype IPD. The pre-PCV7 proportion of VT IPD alone also had limited predictive value. The pre-PCV7 proportion of VT carriage and IPD are the main determinants for the impact of PCV7 on childhood IPD and can be combined in a simple model to provide predictions of the vaccine preventable burden of IPD.","[Flasche, Stefan; de Waroux, Olivier Le Polain; Edmunds, W.

The formation of fruiting bodies is a result of collective cell movement on a solid surface. In the course of development, groups of flexible rod-shaped cells form streams and move in circular or spiral patterns to form aggregation centers that can become sites of fruiting body formation. The mechanisms of such cell movement patterns are not well understood. It has been suggested that myxobacterial development depends on short-range contact-mediated interactions between individual cells, i.e. cell aggregation does not require long-range signaling in the population. In this study, by means of a computational mass-spring model, we investigate what types of short-range interactions between cells can result in the formation of streams and circular aggregates during myxobacterial development. We consider short-range head-to-tail guiding between individual cells, whereby movement direction of the head of one cell is affected by the nearby presence of the tail of another cell. We demonstrate that stable streams and circular aggregates can arise only when the trailing cell, in addition to being steered by the tail of the leading cell, is able to speed up to catch up with it. It is suggested that necessary head-to-tail interactions between cells can arise from physical adhesion, response to a diffusible substance or slime extruded by cells, or pulling by motility engine pili. Finally, we consider a case of long-range guiding between cells and show that circular aggregates are able to form without cells increasing speed. These findings present a possibility to discriminate between short-range and long-range guiding mechanisms in myxobacteria by experimentally measuring distribution of cell speeds in circular aggregates.","[Janulevicius, Albertas; van Loosdrecht, Mark; Picioreanu, Cristian] Delft Univ Technol, Dept Biotechnol, Delft, Netherlands","Janulevicius, A (reprint author), Delft Univ Technol, Dept Biotechnol, Delft, Netherlands.",albertas.janulevicius@gmail.com,"van Loosdrecht, Mark/B-2738-2009","van Loosdrecht, Mark/0000-0003-0658-4775; Janulevicius, Albertas/0000-0002-5626-6209",Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (VIDI) [864-06-003],"This study was funded by the Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (VIDI grant No. 864-06-003, www.nwo.nl).

With well-established methodologies, larger and more complex genomes are being tackled, including polyploid plant genomes. Given the similarity between multiple copies of a basic genome in polyploid individuals, assembly of such data usually results in collapsed contigs that represent a variable number of homoeologous genomic regions. Unfortunately, such collapse is often not ideal, as keeping contigs separate can lead both to improved assembly and also insights about how haplotypes influence phenotype. Here, we describe a first step in avoiding inappropriate collapse during assembly. In particular, we describe ConPADE (Contig Ploidy and Allele Dosage Estimation), a probabilistic method that estimates the ploidy of any given contig/scaffold based on its allele proportions. In the process, we report findings regarding errors in sequencing. The method can be used for whole genome shotgun (WGS) sequencing data. We also show applicability of the method for variant calling and allele dosage estimation. Results for simulated and real data-sets are discussed and provide evidence that ConPADE performs well as long as enough sequencing coverage is available, or the true contig ploidy is low. We show that ConPADE may also be used for related applications, such as the identification of duplicated genes in fragmented assemblies, although refinements are needed.","[Margarido, Gabriel R.

However, the rise of extended spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) producing bacteria has limited the use of beta-lactams. Due to the concern of complex drug responses, many beta-lactams are typically ruled out if ESBL-producing pathogens are detected, even if these pathogens test as susceptible to some beta-lactams. Using quantitative modeling, we show that beta-lactams could still effectively treat pathogens producing low or moderate levels of ESBLs when administered properly. We further develop a metric to guide the design of a dosing protocol to optimize treatment efficiency for any antibiotic-pathogen combination. Ultimately, optimized dosing protocols could allow reintroduction of a repertoire of first-line antibiotics with improved treatment outcomes and preserve last-resort antibiotics.","[Meredith, Hannah R.; Lopatkin, Allison J.; You, Lingchong] Duke Univ, Dept Biomed Engn, Durham, NC 27706 USA; [Anderson, Deverick J.] Duke Univ, Med Ctr, Dept Med, Div Infect Dis, Durham, NC 27710 USA; [Anderson, Deverick J.] Duke Univ, Med Ctr, Duke Infect Control Outreach Network, Durham, NC USA; [You, Lingchong] Duke Univ, Ctr Syst Biol, Durham, NC USA; [You, Lingchong] Duke Univ, Ctr Genom & Computat Biol, Durham, NC USA","Meredith, HR (reprint author), Duke Univ, Dept Biomed Engn, Durham, NC 27706 USA.",you@duke.edu,,"Anderson, Deverick/0000-0001-6882-5496","National Science Foundation [CBET-0953202]; National Institutes of Health [1R01GM098642, 1RO1GM110494]; DuPont Young Professorship; David and Lucile Packard Fellowship; National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship; Howard G.

Cells of the neural crest employ multiple signaling mechanisms to control migration and differentiation during development. It is known that defects in these mechanisms cause neuroblastoma, but how multiple signaling pathways interact to govern cell behavior is unknown. In a phosphoproteomic study of neuroblastoma cell lines and cell fractions, including endosomes and detergent-resistantmembranes, 1622 phosphorylated proteins were detected, including more than half of the receptor tyrosine kinases in the human genome. Data were analyzed using a combination of graph theory and pattern recognition techniques that resolve data structure into networks that incorporate statistical relationships and protein-protein interaction data. Clusters of proteins in these networks are indicative of functional signaling pathways. The analysis indicates that receptor tyrosine kinases are functionally compartmentalized into distinct collaborative groups distinguished by activation and intracellular localization of SRC-family kinases, especially FYN and LYN. Changes in intracellular localization of activated FYN and LYN were observed in response to stimulation of the receptor tyrosine kinases, ALK and KIT.

Chromatin modifications appear to play a guiding role in protein-complex assembly on chromatin. Together, these processes give rise to stochastic, often bursting, transcriptional activity. Here we present a model of eukaryotic transcription that aims to integrate those mechanisms. We use stochastic and ordinary differential-equation modeling frameworks to examine various possible mechanisms of gene regulation by multiple transcription factors. We find that the assembly of large transcription factor complexes on chromatin via equilibrium-binding mechanisms is highly inefficient and insensitive to concentration changes of single regulatory proteins. An alternative model that lacks these limitations is a cyclic ratchet mechanism. In this mechanism, small protein complexes assemble sequentially on the promoter. Chromatin modifications mark the completion of a protein complex assembly, and sensitize the local chromatin for the assembly of the next protein complex. In this manner, a strict order of protein complex assemblies is attained. Even though the individual assembly steps are highly stochastic in duration, a sequence of them gives rise to a remarkable precision of the transcription cycle duration. This mechanism explains how transcription activation cycles, lasting for tens of minutes, derive from regulatory proteins residing on chromatin for only tens of seconds. Transcriptional bursts are an inherent feature of such transcription activation cycles. Bursting transcription can cause individual cells to remain in synchrony transiently, offering an explanation of transcriptional cycling as observed in cell populations, both on promoter chromatin status and mRNA levels.","[Rybakova, Katja N.; Mone, Martijn J.; Westerhoff, Hans V.] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Mol Cell Physiol, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Bruggeman, Frank J.] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Syst Bioinformat, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Tomaszewska, Aleksandra; Carlberg, Carsten] Univ Eastern Finland, Inst Biomed, Sch Med, Kuopio, Finland; [Westerhoff, Hans V.] Univ Manchester, Manchester Ctr Integrat Syst Biol, Manchester, Lancs, England; [Westerhoff, Hans V.] Univ Amsterdam, Netherlands Inst Syst Biol, Synthet Syst Biol, Amsterdam, Netherlands","Rybakova, KN (reprint author), Univ Coll Dublin, Syst Biol Ireland, Dublin 2, Ireland.",H.V.Westerhoff@vu.nl,"Westerhoff, Hans/I-5762-2012; Carlberg, Carsten/C-9075-2011","Westerhoff, Hans/0000-0002-0443-6114; Carlberg, Carsten/0000-0003-2633-0684","European Commission (Marie Curie Research Training Network NucSys) [MRTN-CT-019496]; BBSRC; EPSRC; NWO; EU [FP7, H2020, KBBE.2012.3.4-02, 311815, H2020-INFRADEV-1-2014-1, 62548]; Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council [BB/I004688/1, BB/C008219/1, BB/D019079/1]","KNR, FJB, AT, CC and HVW thank European Commission (ec.europa.eu) for funding (grant number MRTN-CT-019496, Marie Curie Research Training Network NucSys).

Now, given the large amount of available functional genomic data, it is possible to go beyond this and systematically study regulatory circuits in terms of logic elements. To this end, we present Loregic, a computational method integrating gene expression and regulatory network data, to characterize the cooperativity of regulatory factors. Loregic uses all 16 possible two-input-one-output logic gates (e.g. AND or XOR) to describe triplets of two factors regulating a common target. We attempt to find the gate that best matches each triplet's observed gene expression pattern across many conditions. We make Loregic available as a general-purpose tool (github.com/gersteinlab/loregic). We validate it with known yeast transcription-factor knockout experiments. Next, using human ENCODE ChIP-Seq and TCGA RNA-Seq data, we are able to demonstrate how Loregic characterizes complex circuits involving both proximally and distally regulating transcription factors (TFs) and also miRNAs. Furthermore, we show that MYC, a well-known oncogenic driving TF, can be modeled as acting independently from other TFs (e.g., using OR gates) but antagonistically with repressing miRNAs. Finally, we inter-relate Loregic's gate logic with other aspects of regulation, such as indirect binding via protein-protein interactions, feed-forward loop motifs and global regulatory hierarchy.",,,,"Sisu, Cristina/K-8994-2019; Wang, Daifeng/K-2412-2019","Sisu, Cristina/0000-0001-9371-0797; Gerstein, Mark/0000-0002-9746-3719; Rozowsky, Joel/0000-0002-3565-0762",,,,,,,,,,,,1553-734X,1553-7358,,,,APR,2015,11,4,,,,,,,e1004132,10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004132,,,,,,,,WOS:000354517600015,25884877,,,,,,6,8,56,5101,672,510,162,4429,3585,22,822,54,5,0,0,7,7,1

The contribution of this hybrid spreading mechanism, which is also a characteristic of some important computer worm outbreaks, to HIV-1 progression in vivo remains unknown. Here we present a new mathematical model that explicitly incorporates the ability of HIV-1 to use hybrid spreading mechanisms and evaluate the consequences for HIV-1 pathogenenesis. The model captures the major phases of the HIV-1 infection course of a cohort of treatment naive patients and also accurately predicts the results of the Short Pulse Anti-Retroviral Therapy at Seroconversion (SPARTAC) trial. Using this model we find that hybrid spreading is critical to seed and establish infection, and that cell-to-cell spread and increased CD4+ T cell activation are important for HIV-1 progression. Notably, the model predicts that cell-to-cell spread becomes increasingly effective as infection progresses and thus may present a considerable treatment barrier. Deriving predictions of various treatments' influence on HIV-1 progression highlights the importance of earlier intervention and suggests that treatments effectively targeting cell-to-cell HIV-1 spread can delay progression to AIDS.

We present a power calculation to quantify our ability to detect deviations from neutrality using species abundance data. We study non-neutral stochastic community models, and show that the presence of non-neutral processes is detectable if sample size is large enough and/or the amplitude of the effect is strong enough. Our framework can be used for any candidate community model that can be simulated on a computer, and determines both the sampling effort required to distinguish between alternative processes, and a range for the strength of non-neutral processes in communities whose patterns are statistically consistent with neutral theory.

MDPs provide a general framework for modeling tasks in which decisions affect the information on which future choices will be made. Under the assumption that agents are maximizing expected rewards, MDPs provide normative solutions. We find that all three classes of tasks pose choices among actions which trade-off immediate and future expected rewards. The tasks drive these trade-offs in unique ways, however. For bandit and information sampling tasks, increasing uncertainty or the time horizon shifts value to actions that pay-off in the future.

Intra-tumour heterogeneity, the diversity of the cancer cell population within the tumour of an individual patient, is related to cancer stem cells and is also considered a potential prognostic indicator in oncology. The measurement of cancer stem cell abundance and intra-tumour heterogeneity in a clinically relevant manner however, currently presents a challenge. Here we propose signalling entropy, a measure of signalling pathway promiscuity derived from a sample's genome-wide gene expression profile, as an estimate of the stemness of a tumour sample. By considering over 500 mixtures of diverse cellular expression profiles, we reveal that signalling entropy also associates with intra-tumour heterogeneity. By analysing 3668 breast cancer and 1692 lung adenocarcinoma samples, we further demonstrate that signalling entropy correlates negatively with survival, outperforming leading clinical gene expression based prognostic tools. Signalling entropy is found to be a general prognostic measure, valid in different breast cancer clinical subgroups, as well as within stage I lung adenocarcinoma. We find that its prognostic power is driven by genes involved in cancer stem cells and treatment resistance.

Because activity classifications based on changes in gene product level are mechanistically uninformative, we present a theory for gene repression in which the mechanisms of factor action are defined kinetically and are consistent for both gene repression and induction. The theory is generally applicable and amenable to predictions if the dose-response curve for gene repression is non-cooperative with a unit Hill coefficient, which is observed for GR-regulated repression of AP1LUC reporter induction by phorbol myristate acetate. The theory predicts the mechanism of GR and co-factors, and where they act with respect to each other, based on how each cofactor alters the plots of various kinetic parameters vs. cofactor. We show that the kinetically-defined mechanism of action of each of four factors (reporter gene, p160 coactivator TIF2, and two pharmaceuticals [NU6027 and phenanthroline]) is the same in GR-regulated repression and induction.

Although decisions can be as simple as choosing a goal and then pursuing it, humans and animals usually have to make decisions in dynamic environments where the value and the availability of an option change unpredictably with time and previous actions. A predator chasing multiple prey exemplifies how goals can dynamically change and compete during ongoing actions. Classical psychological theories posit that decision making takes place within frontal areas and is a separate process from perception and action. However, recent findings argue for additional mechanisms and suggest the decisions between actions often emerge through a continuous competition within the same brain regions that plan and guide action execution. According to these findings, the sensorimotor system generates concurrent action-plans for competing goals and uses online information to bias the competition until a single goal is pursued. This information is diverse, relating to both the dynamic value of the goal and the cost of acting, creating a challenging problem in integrating information across these diverse variables in real time. We introduce a computational framework for dynamically integrating value information from disparate sources in decision tasks with competing actions.

The Phase Response Curve (PRC), a simple input-output characterization of single cells, can provide insights into individual and collective properties of neurons and networks, by quantifying the impact of an infinitesimal depolarizing current pulse on the time of occurrence of subsequent action potentials, while a neuron is firing tonically. Recently, the PRC theory applied to cerebellar Purkinje cells revealed that these behave as phase-independent integrators at low firing rates, and switch to a phase-dependent mode at high rates. Given the implications for computation and information processing in the cerebellum and the possible role of synchrony in the communication with its post-synaptic targets, we further explored the firing rate dependency of the PRC in Purkinje cells. We isolated key factors for the experimental estimation of the PRC and developed a closed-loop approach to reliably compute the PRC across diverse firing rates in the same cell. Our results show unambiguously that the PRC of individual Purkinje cells is firing rate dependent and that it smoothly transitions from phase independent integrator to a phase dependent mode.

However, cysteines are susceptible to oxidation by Reactive Oxygen and Nitrogen Species, leading to a loss of their catalytic function. Therefore, cysteine oxidation is emerging as a relevant physiological regulatory mechanism. Formation of a cyclic sulfenyl amide residue at the active site of redox-regulated proteins has been proposed as a protection mechanism against irreversible oxidation as the sulfenyl amide intermediate has been identified in several proteins. However, how and why only some specific cysteine residues in particular proteins react to form this intermediate is still unknown. In the present work using in-silico based tools, we have identified a constrained conformation that accelerates sulfenyl amide formation. By means of combined MD and QM/MM calculation we show that this conformation positions the NH backbone towards the sulfenic acid and promotes the reaction to yield the sulfenyl amide intermediate, in one step with the concomitant release of a water molecule. Moreover, in a large subset of the proteins we found a conserved beta sheet-loop-helix motif, which is present across different protein folds, that is key for sulfenyl amide production as it promotes the previous formation of sulfenic acid. For catalytic activity, in several cases, proteins need the Cysteine to be in the cysteinate form, i.e. a low pKa Cys. We found that the conserved motif stabilizes the cysteinate by hydrogen bonding to several NH backbone moieties. As cysteinate is also more reactive toward ROS we propose that the sheet-loop-helix motif and the constraint conformation have been selected by evolution for proteins that need a reactive Cys protected from irreversible oxidation.

Existing algorithms for signature-based drug repurposing use only individual signatures as input. But for many diseases, there are dozens of signatures in the public domain. Methods that exploit all available transcriptional knowledge on a disease should produce improved drug predictions. Here, we adapt an established meta-analysis framework to address the problem of drug repurposing using an ensemble of disease signatures.

Motivated by the important, cooperative roles of viral genomes in the assembly of single-stranded RNA viruses, we have developed a new analysis method that reveals the asymmetric structural organization of viral genomes in proximity to the capsid in such viruses. The method uses geometric constraints on genome organization, formulated based on knowledge of icosahedrally-averaged reconstructions and the roles of the RNA-capsid protein contacts, to analyse cryo-electron tomographic data.

TIE-2-expressing monocytes (TEM) have been reported to critically account for tumor vascularization and growth in mouse tumor experimental models, but the molecular basis of their pro-angiogenic activity are largely unknown. Moreover, differences in the pro-angiogenic activity between blood circulating and tumor infiltrated TEM in human patients has not been established to date, hindering the identification of specific targets for therapeutic intervention. In this work, we investigated these differences and the phenotypic reversal of breast tumor pro-angiogenic TEM to a weak pro-angiogenic phenotype by combining Boolean modelling and experimental approaches. Firstly, we show that in breast cancer patients the pro-angiogenic activity of TEM increased drastically from blood to tumor, suggesting that the tumor micro-environment shapes the highly pro-angiogenic phenotype of TEM. Secondly, we predicted in silico all minimal perturbations transitioning the highly pro-angiogenic phenotype of tumor TEM to the weak pro-angiogenic phenotype of blood TEM and vice versa. In silico predicted perturbations were validated experimentally using patient TEM. In addition, gene expression profiling of TEM transitioned to a weak pro-angiogenic phenotype confirmed that TEM are plastic cells and can be reverted to immunological potent monocytes. Finally, the relapse-free survival analysis showed a statistically significant difference between patients with tumors with high and low expression values for genes encoding transitioning proteins detected in silico and validated on patient TEM. In conclusion, the inferred TEM regulatory network accurately captured experimental TEM behavior and highlighted crosstalk between specific angiogenic and inflammatory signaling pathways of outstanding importance to control their pro-angiogenic activity. Results showed the successful in vitro reversion of such an activity by perturbation of in silico predicted target genes in tumor derived TEM, and indicated that targeting tumor TEM plasticity may constitute a novel valid therapeutic strategy in breast cancer.",,,,,"Coukos, George/0000-0001-8813-7367; Crespo, Isaac/0000-0003-3151-3901",,,,,,,,,,,,,1553-7358,,,,MAR,2015,11,3,,,,,,,UNSP e1004050,10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004050,,,,,,,,WOS:000352195700004,25768678,,,,,,11,22,16,4333,634,464,170,3699,3090,23,586,15,0,0,0,7,7,0

Here we apply a combined in-vitro and in-silico approach to investigate the spatio-temporal regulation of WNT/beta-catenin signaling during the early neural differentiation process of human neural progenitors cells (hNPCs), which form a new prospect for replacement therapies in the context of neuro-degenerative diseases. Experimental measurements indicate a second signal mechanism, in addition to canonical WNT signaling, being involved in the regulation of nuclear beta-catenin levels during the cell fate commitment phase of neural differentiation. We find that the biphasic activation of beta-catenin signaling observed experimentally can only be explained through a model that combines Reactive Oxygen Species ( ROS) and raft dependent WNT/beta-catenin signaling. Accordingly after initiation of differentiation endogenous ROS activates DVL in a redox-dependent manner leading to a transient activation of down-stream beta-catenin signaling, followed by continuous auto/paracrine WNT signaling, which crucially depends on lipid rafts. Our simulation studies further illustrate the elaborate spatio-temporal regulation of DVL, which, depending on its concentration and localization, may either act as direct inducer of the transient ROS/beta-catenin signal or as amplifier during continuous auto-/parcrine WNT/beta-catenin signaling. In addition we provide the first stochastic computational model of WNT/beta-catenin signaling that combines membrane-related and intracellular processes, including lipid rafts/receptor dynamics as well as WNT- and ROS-dependent beta-catenin activation. The model's predictive ability is demonstrated under a wide range of varying conditions for in-vitro and in-silico reference data sets. Our in-silico approach is realized in a multi-level rule-based language, that facilitates the extension and modification of the model.

These theories often appeal to circumstances where planning apparently goes awry. For instance, if reaction times are forced to be very low, movement trajectories are often directed between two potential targets. These intermediate movements are generally interpreted as errors of movement planning, arising either from planning being incomplete or from parallel movement plans interfering with one another. Here we present an alternative view: that intermediate movements reflect uncertainty about movement goals. We show how intermediate movements are predicted by an optimal feedback control model that incorporates an ongoing decision about movement goals. According to this view, intermediate movements reflect an exploitation of compatibility between goals. Consequently, reducing the compatibility between goals should reduce the incidence of intermediate movements. In human subjects, we varied the compatibility between potential movement goals in two distinct ways: by varying the spatial separation between targets and by introducing a virtual barrier constraining trajectories to the target and penalizing intermediate movements. In both cases we found that decreasing goal compatibility led to a decreasing incidence of intermediate movements. Our results and theory suggest a more integrated view of decision-making and movement planning in which the primary bottleneck to generating a movement is deciding upon task goals.

However, the majority of existing studies have focussed on emergence at the population level, and not within a host. In particular, the coexistence of pre-existing and mutated strains triggers a heightened immune response due to the larger total pathogen population; this feedback can smother mutated strains before they reach an ample size and establish. Here, we extend previous work for measuring emergence probabilities in non-equilibrium populations, to within-host models of acute infections. We create a mathematical model to investigate the emergence probability of a fitter strain if it mutates from a self-limiting strain that is guaranteed to go extinct in the long-term. We show that ongoing immune cell proliferation during the initial stages of infection causes a drastic reduction in the probability of emergence of mutated strains; we further outline how this effect can be accurately measured. Further analysis of the model shows that, in the short-term, mutant strains that enlarge their replication rate due to evolving an increased growth rate are more favoured than strains that suffer a lower immune-mediated death rate ('immune tolerance'), as the latter does not completely evade ongoing immune proliferation due to inter-parasitic competition.

We term this method empirical JTK_CYCLE with asymmetry search, and we compare its performance to JTK_CYCLE with Bonferroni and Benjamini-Hochberg multiple hypothesis testing correction, as well as to five other methods: cyclohedron test, address reduction, stable persistence, ANOVA, and F24. We find that ANOVA, F24, and JTK_CYCLE consistently outperform the other three methods when data are limited and noisy; empirical JTK_CYCLE with asymmetry search gives the greatest sensitivity while controlling for the false discovery rate. Our analysis also provides insight into experimental design and we find that, for a fixed number of samples, better sensitivity and specificity are achieved with higher numbers of replicates than with higher sampling density. Application of the methods to detecting circadian rhythms in a metadataset of microarrays that quantify time-dependent gene expression in whole heads of Drosophila melanogaster reveals annotations that are enriched among genes with highly asymmetric waveforms.

The overall fold of the protein in lipid bilayers remained similar to the crystal structure in detergent on the timescale of our simulations. Simulations were performed in the absence of uracil, and resulted in a closed state of the transporter, due to relative movement of the gate and core domains. Anionic lipids, including POPG and especially CL, were found to associate with UraA, involving interactions between specific basic residues in loop regions and phosphate oxygens of the CL head group. In particular, three CL binding sites were identified on UraA: two in the inner leaflet and a single site in the outer leaflet. Mutation of basic residues in the binding sites resulted in the loss of CL binding in the simulations.

For example, formal descriptions of how reward value changes with increasing temporal delays allow for quantifying individual decision preferences, as in animal species populating different habitats, or normal and clinical human populations. Strikingly, it remains largely unclear how humans evaluate rewards when these are tied to energetic costs, despite the surge of interest in the neural basis of effort-guided decision-making and the prevalence of disorders showing a diminished willingness to exert effort (e.g., depression). One common assumption is that effort discounts reward in a similar way to delay. Here we challenge this assumption by formally comparing competing hypotheses about effort and delay discounting. We used a design specifically optimized to compare discounting behavior for both effort and delay over a wide range of decision costs (Experiment 1). We then additionally characterized the profile of effort discounting free of model assumptions (Experiment 2). Contrary to previous reports, in both experiments effort costs devalued reward in a manner opposite to delay, with small devaluations for lower efforts, and progressively larger devaluations for higher effort-levels (concave shape). Bayesian model comparison confirmed that delay-choices were best predicted by a hyperbolic model, with the largest reward devaluations occurring at shorter delays. In contrast, an altogether different relationship was observed for effort-choices, which were best described by a model of inverse sigmoidal shape that is initially concave. Our results provide a novel characterization of human effort discounting behavior and its first dissociation from delay discounting. This enables accurate modelling of cost-benefit decisions, a prerequisite for the investigation of the neural underpinnings of effort-guided choice and for understanding the deficits in clinical disorders characterized by behavioral inactivity.",,,,"Kennerley, Steven/E-3330-2018","Kennerley, Steven/0000-0002-5696-7507; Penny, William/0000-0001-9064-1191; Klein-Flugge, Miriam/0000-0002-5156-9833",,,,,,,,,,,,,1553-7358,,,,MAR,2015,11,3,,,,,,,UNSP e1004116,10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004116,,,,,,,,WOS:000352195700025,25816114,,,,,,35,10,93,6132,742,564,178,5390,4432,33,925,93,3,0,0,30,30,0

Analysis shows that the cell cycle trajectory is sharply confined by the ambient energy barrier, and the landscape along this trajectory exhibits a generally flat shape. We explain the evolution of the system on this flat path by incorporating its non-gradient nature. Furthermore, we illustrate how this global landscape changes in response to external signals, observing a nice transformation of the landscapes as the excitable system approaches a limit cycle system when nutrients are sufficient, as well as the formation of additional energy wells when the DNA replication checkpoint is activated. By taking into account the finite volume effect, we find additional pits along the flat cycle path in the landscape associated with the checkpoint mechanism of the cell cycle.

Although necessary, however, actual experience is not sufficient for memory formation. One-trial learning is also gated by knowledge of appropriate background information to make sense of the experienced occurrence. Strong neurobiological evidence suggests that long-term memory storage involves formation of new synapses. On the short time scale, this form of structural plasticity requires that the axon of the pre-synaptic neuron be physically proximal to the dendrite of the post-synaptic neuron. We surmise that such ""axonal-dendritic overlap"" (ADO) constitutes the neural correlate of background information-gated (BIG) learning. The hypothesis is based on a fundamental neuroanatomical constraint: an axon must pass close to the dendrites that are near other neurons it contacts. The topographic organization of the mammalian cortex ensures that nearby neurons encode related information. Using neural network simulations, we demonstrate that ADO is a suitable mechanism for BIG learning. We model knowledge as associations between terms, concepts or indivisible units of thought via directed graphs. The simplest instantiation encodes each concept by single neurons.

We recently used yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) screening to identify a small set of novel Burkholderia proteins that were shown to attenuate disease progression in an aerosol infection animal model using the virulent Burkholderia mallei ATCC 23344 strain. Here, we performed an extended analysis of primarily nine B. mallei virulence factors and their interactions with human proteins to map out how the bacteria can influence and alter host processes and pathways. Specifically, we employed topological analyses to assess the connectivity patterns of targeted host proteins, identify modules of pathogen-interacting host proteins linked to processes promoting infectivity, and evaluate the effect of crosstalk among the identified host protein modules. Overall, our analysis showed that the targeted host proteins generally had a large number of interacting partners and interacted with other host proteins that were also targeted by B. mallei proteins. We also introduced a novel Host-Pathogen Interaction Alignment (HPIA) algorithm and used it to explore similarities between host-pathogen interactions of B. mallei, Yersinia pestis, and Salmonella enterica. We inferred putative roles of B. mallei proteins based on the roles of their aligned Y. pestis and S. enterica partners and showed that up to 73% of the predicted roles matched existing annotations. A key insight into Burkholderia pathogenicity derived from these analyses of Y2H host-pathogen interactions is the identification of eukaryotic-specific targeted cellular mechanisms, including the ubiquitination degradation system and the use of the focal adhesion pathway as a fulcrum for transmitting mechanical forces and regulatory signals. This provides the mechanisms to modulate and adapt the host-cell environment for the successful establishment of host infections and intracellular spread.",,,,,"wallqvist, anders/0000-0002-9775-7469; Rajagopala, Seesandra/0000-0001-7176-5770",,,,,,,,,,,,1553-7358,,,,,MAR,2015,11,3,,,,,,,UNSP e1004088,10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004088,,,,,,,,WOS:000352195700014,25738731,,,,,,13,1,44,4493,802,610,192,3691,3069,24,598,43,0,0,0,13,13,0

Targeting the mechanisms of action of proteins involved in bacterial cell division bypasses problems associated with increasingly ineffective variants of older antibiotics; to this end, the essential bacterial cytoskeletal protein FtsZ is a promising target. Recent work on its allosteric inhibitor, PC190723, revealed in vitro activity on Staphylococcus aureus FtsZ and in vivo antimicrobial activities. However, the mechanism of drug action and its effect on FtsZ in other bacterial species are unclear. Here, we examine the structural environment of the PC190723 binding pocket using PocketFEATURE, a statistical method that scores the similarity between pairs of small-molecule binding sites based on 3D structure information about the local microenvironment, and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. We observed that species and nucleotide-binding state have significant impacts on the structural properties of the binding site, with substantially disparate microenvironments for bacterial species not from the Staphylococcus genus. Based on PocketFEATURE analysis of MD simulations of S. aureus FtsZ bound to GTP or with mutations that are known to confer PC190723 resistance, we predict that PC190723 strongly prefers to bind Staphylococcus FtsZ in the nucleotide-bound state. Furthermore, MD simulations of an FtsZ dimer indicated that polymerization may enhance PC190723 binding. Taken together, our results demonstrate that a drug-binding pocket can vary significantly across species, genetic perturbations, and in different polymerization states, yielding important information for the further development of FtsZ inhibitors.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1553-7358,,,,,MAR,2015,11,3,,,,,,,e1004117,10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004117,,,,,,,,WOS:000352195700026,25811761,,,,,,11,3,14,3039,439,327,112,2600,2130,22,448,14,0,0,0,10,10,1

A single kinesin molecule is able to transport its cargo about 1 mu m in the absence of external loads. However, kinesins perform much longer range transport in cells by working collectively. This long range of transport by a team of kinesins is surprising because the motion of the cargo in cells can be hindered by other particles. To reveal how the kinesins are able to accomplish their tasks of transport in harsh intracellular circumstances, stochastic studies on the kinesin motion are performed by considering the binding and unbinding of kinesins to microtubules and their dependence on the force acting on kinesin molecules. The unbinding probabilities corresponding to each mechanochemical state of kinesin are modeled. The statistical characterization of the instants and locations of binding are captured by computing the probability of unbound kinesin being at given locations. It is predicted that a group of kinesins has a more efficient transport than a single kinesin from the perspective of velocity and run length. Particularly, when large loads are applied, the leading kinesin remains bound to the microtubule for long time which increases the chances of the other kinesins to bind to the microtubule. To predict effects of this behavior of the leading kinesin under large loads on the collective transport, the motion of the cargo is studied when the cargo confronts obstacles. The result suggests that the behavior of kinesins under large loads prevents the early termination of the transport which can be caused by the interference with the static or moving obstacles.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1553-734X,1553-7358,,,,MAR,2015,11,3,,,,,,,UNSP e1003981,10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003981,,,,,,,,WOS:000352195700001,25734978,,,,,,10,0,19,2171,333,221,112,1838,1483,26,329,19,0,0,0,8,8,0

We set out to investigate the emerging intratumoral heterogeneity and to determine the evolutionary trajectories of the combination of cell-intrinsic kinetics that yield aggressive tumor growth. We develop a cellular automaton model that tracks the temporal evolution of the malignant subpopulation of so-called cancer stem cells (CSC), as these cells are exclusively able to initiate and sustain tumors. We explore orthogonal cell traits, including cell migration to facilitate invasion, spontaneous cell death due to genetic drift after accumulation of irreversible deleterious mutations, symmetric cancer stem cell division that increases the cancer stem cell pool, and telomere length and erosion as a mitotic counter for inherited non-stem cancer cell proliferation potential. Our study suggests that cell proliferation potential is the strongest modulator of tumor growth. Early increase in proliferation potential yields larger populations of non-stem cancer cells (CC) that compete with CSC and thus inhibit CSC division while a reduction in proliferation potential loosens such inhibition and facilitates frequent CSC division.

During learning these neurons become tuned to relevant features and start to represent them with persistent activity during memory delays. This learning process is not well understood. Here we develop a biologically plausible learning scheme that explains how trial-and-error learning induces neuronal selectivity and working memory representations for task-relevant information. We propose that the response selection stage sends attentional feedback signals to earlier processing levels, forming synaptic tags at those connections responsible for the stimulus-response mapping. Globally released neuromodulators then interact with tagged synapses to determine their plasticity. The resulting learning rule endows neural networks with the capacity to create new working memory representations of task relevant information as persistent activity. It is remarkably generic: it explains how association neurons learn to store task-relevant information for linear as well as non-linear stimulus-response mappings, how they become tuned to category boundaries or analog variables, depending on the task demands, and how they learn to integrate probabilistic evidence for perceptual decisions.",,,,"Roelfsema, Pieter/J-6903-2013","Roelfsema, Pieter/0000-0002-1625-0034",,,,,,,,,,,,,1553-7358,,,,MAR,2015,11,3,,,,,,,e1004060,10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004060,,,,,,,,WOS:000352195700007,25742003,,,,,,19,2,89,5369,382,263,119,4987,3880,29,1078,88,0,0,0,17,17,0

We further show how direct inhibition of calcium channels in the dendrites modulates such coincidence detection.

We had previously elicited the participants' time preferences for the same painful stimuli in one-off choices, allowing us to assess self-consistency. Participants exhibited three characteristic behaviors: saving relief until the end, spreading relief across time, and early spending, of which the last was markedly less prominent.

As an attempt to shed light on this issue, here we explore heterocyst differentiation under the paradigm of systems biology. This framework allows us to formulate the essential dynamical ingredients of the genetic circuit of a single cyanobacterium into a set of differential equations describing the time evolution of the concentrations of the relevant molecular products. As a result, we are able to study the behavior of a single cyanobacterium under different external conditions, emulating nitrogen deprivation, and simulate the dynamics of cyanobacteria filaments by coupling their respective genetic circuits via molecular diffusion. These two ingredients allow us to understand the principles by which heterocyst patterns can be generated and sustained.

Although intracellular electrophysiology is a powerful tool for studying synaptic integration and plasticity, it is limited by the small number of neurons that can be recorded simultaneously in vitro and by the technical difficulty of intracellular recording in vivo. One way around these difficulties may be to use large-scale extracellular recording of spike trains and apply statistical methods to model and infer functional connections between neurons. These techniques have the potential to reveal large-scale connectivity structure based on the spike timing alone. However, the interpretation of functional connectivity is often approximate, since only a small fraction of presynaptic inputs are typically observed. Here we use in vitro current injection in layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons to validate methods for inferring functional connectivity in a setting where input to the neuron is controlled. In experiments with partially-defined input, we inject a single simulated input with known amplitude on a background of fluctuating noise. In a fully-defined input paradigm, we then control the synaptic weights and timing of many simulated presynaptic neurons. By analyzing the firing of neurons in response to these artificial inputs, we ask 1) How does functional connectivity inferred from spikes relate to simulated synaptic input? and 2) What are the limitations of connectivity inference? We find that individual current-based synaptic inputs are detectable over a broad range of amplitudes and conditions. Detectability depends on input amplitude and output firing rate, and excitatory inputs are detected more readily than inhibitory. Moreover, as we model increasing numbers of presynaptic inputs, we are able to estimate connection strengths more accurately and detect the presence of connections more quickly.

Here we study the formation of such percepts under the assumption that they emerge from a linear readout, i.e., a weighted sum of the neurons' firing rates. We show that this assumption constrains the trial-to-trial covariance structure of neural activities and animal behavior. The predicted covariance structure depends on the readout parameters, and in particular on the temporal integration window w and typical number of neurons K used in the formation of the percept. Using these predictions, we show how to infer the readout parameters from joint measurements of a subject's behavior and neural activities. We consider three such scenarios: (1) recordings from the complete neural population, (2) recordings of neuronal sub-ensembles whose size exceeds K, and (3) recordings of neuronal sub-ensembles that are smaller than K. Using theoretical arguments and artificially generated data, we show that the first two scenarios allow us to recover the typical spatial and temporal scales of the readout.

James; Tolias, Andreas S.",,,Improved Estimation and Interpretation of Correlations in Neural Circuits,PLOS COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY,,,,,,,,,,,,"Ambitious projects aim to record the activity of ever larger and denser neuronal populations in vivo. Correlations in neural activity measured in such recordings can reveal important aspects of neural circuit organization. However, estimating and interpreting large correlation matrices is statistically challenging. Estimation can be improved by regularization, i.e. by imposing a structure on the estimate. The amount of improvement depends on how closely the assumed structure represents dependencies in the data. Therefore, the selection of the most efficient correlation matrix estimator for a given neural circuit must be determined empirically. Importantly, the identity and structure of the most efficient estimator informs about the types of dominant dependencies governing the system. We sought statistically efficient estimators of neural correlation matrices in recordings from large, dense groups of cortical neurons. Using fast 3D random-access laser scanning microscopy of calcium signals, we recorded the activity of nearly every neuron in volumes 200 mu m wide and 100 mu m deep (150-350 cells) in mouse visual cortex. We hypothesized that in these densely sampled recordings, the correlation matrix should be best modeled as the combination of a sparse graph of pairwise partial correlations representing local interactions and a low-rank component representing common fluctuations and external inputs. Indeed, in cross-validation tests, the covariance matrix estimator with this structure consistently outperformed other regularized estimators. The sparse component of the estimate defined a graph of interactions. These interactions reflected the physical distances and orientation tuning properties of cells: The density of positive 'excitatory' interactions decreased rapidly with geometric distances and with differences in orientation preference whereas negative 'inhibitory' interactions were less selective. Because of its superior performance, this 'sparse+latent' estimator likely provides a more physiologically relevant representation of the functional connectivity in densely sampled recordings than the sample correlation matrix.",,,,,"Froudarakis, Emmanouil/0000-0002-3249-3845",,,,,,,,,,,,1553-734X,1553-7358,,,,MAR,2015,11,3,,,,,,,UNSP e1004083,10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004083,,,,,,,,WOS:000352195700013,25826696,,,,,,24,17,111,7096,645,495,150,6451,4796,31,1624,110,16,0,0,20,20,1

This constitutes a severe limitation to the use of metagenomic data in therapeutic and diagnostic applications. To provide a more robust statistical framework, we introduce a class of feature-weighting algorithms that discriminate the taxa responsible for the classification of metagenomic samples. The method unambiguously groups the relevant taxa into clades without relying on pre-defined taxonomic categories, thus including in the analysis also those sequences for which a taxonomic classification is difficult. The phylogenetic clades are weighted and ranked according to their abundance measuring their contribution to the differentiation of the classes of samples, and a criterion is provided to define a reduced set of most relevant clades. Applying the method to public datasets, we show that the data-driven definition of relevant phylogenetic clades accomplished by our ranking strategy identifies features in the samples that are lost if phylogenetic relationships are not considered, improving our ability to mine metagenomic datasets.

A bow-tie in a multi-layered structure occurs when intermediate layers have much fewer components than the input and output layers. Examples include metabolism where a handful of building blocks mediate between multiple input nutrients and multiple output biomass components, and signaling networks where information from numerous receptor types passes through a small set of signaling pathways to regulate multiple output genes. Little is known, however, about how bow-tie architectures evolve. Here, we address the evolution of bow-tie architectures using simulations of multi-layered systems evolving to fulfill a given input-output goal. We find that bow-ties spontaneously evolve when the information in the evolutionary goal can be compressed. Mathematically speaking, bow-ties evolve when the rank of the input-output matrix describing the evolutionary goal is deficient. The maximal compression possible ( the rank of the goal) determines the size of the narrowest part of the network-that is the bow-tie. A further requirement is that a process is active to reduce the number of links in the network, such as product-rule mutations, otherwise a non-bow-tie solution is found in the evolutionary simulations.

The development of resistance is commonly attributed to genetic heterogeneity. However, heterogeneity of drug penetration of the tumor microenvironment both on the microscopic level within solid tumors as well as on the macroscopic level across metastases may also contribute to acquired drug resistance. Here we use mathematical models to investigate the effect of drug heterogeneity on the probability of escape from treatment and the time to resistance. Specifically we address scenarios with sufficiently potent therapies that suppress growth of all preexisting genetic variants in the compartment with the highest possible drug concentration. To study the joint effect of drug heterogeneity, growth rate, and evolution of resistance, we analyze a multi-type stochastic branching process describing growth of cancer cells in multiple compartments with different drug concentrations and limited migration between compartments. We show that resistance is likely to arise first in the sanctuary compartment with poor drug penetrations and from there populate non-sanctuary compartments with high drug concentrations. Moreover, we show that only below a threshold rate of cell migration does spatial heterogeneity accelerate resistance evolution, otherwise deterring drug resistance with excessively high migration rates.

Results show that gene expression is an excellent predictor of environmental structure, with multi-class ensemble models achieving balanced accuracy between 70.0% (+/- 3.5%) to 98.3%(+/- 2.3%) for the various characteristics. Interestingly, this performance can be significantly boosted when environmental and strain characteristics are simultaneously considered, as a composite classifier that captures the inter-dependencies of three characteristics (medium, phase and strain) achieved 10.6% (+/- 1.0%) higher performance than any individual models. Contrary to expectations, only 59% of the top informative genes were also identified as differentially expressed under the respective conditions.

Within social groups, contest-competition can fundamentally affect nutrient access, potentially leading to reproductive asymmetry among individuals. Previously, agent-based models have been combined with the Geometric Framework of nutrition to provide insight into how nutrition and social interactions affect one another. Here, we expand this modelling approach by incorporating evolutionary algorithms to explore how contest-competition over nutrient acquisition might affect the evolution of animal nutritional strategies. Specifically, we model tolerance of nutrient excesses and deficits when ingesting nutritionally imbalanced foods, which we term 'nutritional latitude'; a higher degree of nutritional latitude constitutes a higher tolerance of nutritional excess and deficit. Our results indicate that a transition between two alternative strategies occurs at moderate to high levels of competition. When competition is low, individuals display a low level of nutritional latitude and regularly switch foods in search of an optimum. When food is scarce and contest-competition is intense, high nutritional latitude appears optimal, and individuals continue to consume an imbalanced food for longer periods before attempting to switch to an alternative. However, the relative balance of nutrients within available foods also strongly influences at what levels of competition, if any, transitions between these two strategies occur. Our models imply that competition combined with reproductive skew in social groups can play a role in the evolution of diet breadth.

To prevent neuronal hyperexcitability, potassium ions have to be taken up quickly. However, the dynamics of the activity-dependent potassium fluxes and the molecular pathways underlying extracellular potassium homeostasis remain elusive. To decipher the specific and acute contribution of astroglial Kir4.1 channels in controlling potassium homeostasis and the moment to moment neurotransmission, we built a tri-compartment model accounting for potassium dynamics between neurons, astrocytes and the extracellular space. We here demonstrate that astroglial Kir4.1 channels are sufficient to account for the slow membrane depolarization of hippocampal astrocytes and crucially contribute to extracellular potassium clearance during basal and high activity. By quantifying the dynamics of potassium levels in neuron-glia-extracellular space compartments, we show that astrocytes buffer within 6 to 9 seconds more than 80% of the potassium released by neurons in response to basal, repetitive and tetanic stimulations. Astroglial Kir4.1 channels directly lead to recovery of basal extracellular potassium levels and neuronal excitability, especially during repetitive stimulation, thereby preventing the generation of epileptiform activity. Remarkably, we also show that Kir4.1 channels strongly regulate neuronal excitability for slow 3 to 10 Hz rhythmic activity resulting from probabilistic firing activity induced by sub-firing stimulation coupled to Brownian noise.

J.; Ernst, Marc O.",,,Mapping Shape to Visuomotor Mapping: Learning and Generalisation of Sensorimotor Behaviour Based on Contextual Information,PLOS COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY,,,,,,,,,,,,"Humans can learn and store multiple visuomotor mappings (dual-adaptation) when feedback for each is provided alternately. Moreover, learned context cues associated with each mapping can be used to switch between the stored mappings. However, little is known about the associative learning between cue and required visuomotor mapping, and how learning generalises to novel but similar conditions. To investigate these questions, participants performed a rapid target-pointing task while we manipulated the offset between visual feedback and movement end-points. The visual feedback was presented with horizontal offsets of different amounts, dependent on the targets shape. Participants thus needed to use different visuomotor mappings between target location and required motor response depending on the target shape in order to ""hit"" it. The target shapes were taken from a continuous set of shapes, morphed between spiky and circular shapes. After training we tested participants performance, without feedback, on different target shapes that had not been learned previously. We compared two hypotheses. First, we hypothesised that participants could (explicitly) extract the linear relationship between target shape and visuomotor mapping and generalise accordingly. Second, using previous findings of visuomotor learning, we developed a (implicit) Bayesian learning model that predicts generalisation that is more consistent with categorisation (i.e. use one mapping or the other). The experimental results show that, although learning the associations requires explicit awareness of the cues' role, participants apply the mapping corresponding to the trained shape that is most similar to the current one, consistent with the Bayesian learning model. Furthermore, the Bayesian learning model predicts that learning should slow down with increased numbers of training pairs, which was confirmed by the present results. In short, we found a good correspondence between the Bayesian learning model and the empirical results indicating that this model poses a possible mechanism for simultaneously learning multiple visuomotor mappings.",,,,"van Dam, Loes C.J./I-5141-2015","van Dam, Loes C.J./0000-0003-0590-9347",,,,,,,,,,,,,1553-7358,,,,MAR,2015,11,3,,,,,,,UNSP e1004172,10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004172,,,,,,,,WOS:000352195700050,25815787,,,,,,6,3,37,3910,567,463,104,3343,2183,58,1102,37,0,0,0,3,3,0

Towards this goal, and because domains are the functional units of a protein, we explored the protein domain-level landscape of cancer-type-specific somatic mutations. Specifically, we systematically examined tumor genomes from 21 cancer types to identify domains with high mutational density in specific tissues, the positions of mutational hotspots within these domains, and the functional and structural context where possible. While hotspots corresponding to specific gain-of-function mutations are expected for oncoproteins, we found that tumor suppressor proteins also exhibit strong biases toward being mutated in particular domains. Within domains, however, we observed the expected patterns of mutation, with recurrently mutated positions for oncogenes and evenly distributed mutations for tumor suppressors. For example, we identified both known and new endometrial cancer hotspots in the tyrosine kinase domain of the FGFR2 protein, one of which is also a hotspot in breast cancer, and found new two hotspots in the Immunoglobulin I-set domain in colon cancer. Thus, to prioritize cancer mutations for further functional studies aimed at more precise cancer treatments, we have systematically correlated mutations and cancer types at the protein domain level.",,,,"Roth, Frederick/H-6308-2011","Roth, Frederick/0000-0002-6628-649X; Petsalaki, Evangelia/0000-0002-8294-2995; Rolland, Thomas/0000-0001-6468-8391",,,,,,,,,,,,,1553-7358,,,,MAR,2015,11,3,,,,,,,UNSP e1004147,10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004147,,,,,,,,WOS:000352195700038,25794154,,,,,,25,4,101,7826,900,759,141,6926,5611,33,1282,93,4,0,0,22,22,2

A famous result in population genetics asserts that the rate, K, at which these substitutions accumulate in the population coincides with the mutation rate, u, at which they arise in individuals: K = u. This identity enables genetic sequence data to be used as a ""molecular clock"" to estimate the timing of evolutionary events. While the molecular clock is known to be perturbed by selection, it is thought that K = u holds very generally for neutral evolution. Here we show that asymmetric spatial population structure can alter the molecular clock rate for neutral mutations, leading to either K<u or K>u. Our results apply to a general class of haploid, asexually reproducing, spatially structured populations. Deviations from K = u occur because mutations arise unequally at different sites and have different probabilities of fixation depending on where they arise. If birth rates are uniform across sites, then K <= u. In general, K can take any value between 0 and Nu. Our model can be applied to a variety of population structures. In one example, we investigate the accumulation of genetic mutations in the small intestine.

In natural conditions, these two major tropisms act concurrently to create a photogravitropic equilibrium in the responsive organ. Recently, a parsimonious model was developed that accurately predicted the complete gravitropic and proprioceptive control over the movement of different organs in different species in response to gravitational stimuli. Here we show that the framework of this unifying graviproprioceptive model can be readily extended to include phototropism. The interaction between gravitropism and phototropism results in an alignment of the apical part of the organ toward a photogravitropic set-point angle. This angle is determined by a combination of the two directional stimuli, gravity and light, weighted by the ratio between the gravi- and photo-sensitivities of the plant organ. In the model, two dimensionless numbers, the graviproprioceptive number B and the photograviceptive number M, control the dynamics and the shapes of the movement. The extended model agrees well with two sets of detailed quantitative data on photogravitropic equilibrium in oat coleoptiles. It is demonstrated that the influence of light intensity I can be included in the model in a power-law-dependent relationship M(I).

Candidate vaccines, based upon Mycobacterium bovis bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) all interfere with the action of the tuberculin skin test, which is used to determine if animals, herds and countries are officially bTB-free. New diagnostic tests that Differentiate Infected from Vaccinated Animals (DIVA) offer the potential to introduce vaccination within existing eradication programs. We use within-herd transmission models estimated from historical data from Great Britain (GB) to explore the feasibility of such supplemental use of vaccination. The economic impact of bovine Tuberculosis for farmers is dominated by the costs associated with testing, and associated restrictions on animal movements. Farmers' willingness to adopt vaccination will require vaccination to not only reduce the burden of infection, but also the risk of restrictions being imposed. We find that, under the intensive sequence of testing in GB, it is the specificity of the DIVA test, rather than the sensitivity, that is the greatest barrier to see a herd level benefit of vaccination. The potential negative effects of vaccination could be mitigated through relaxation of testing. However, this could potentially increase the hidden burden of infection within Officially TB Free herds. Using our models, we explore the range of the DIVA test characteristics necessary to see a protective herd level benefit of vaccination. We estimate that a DIVA specificity of at least 99.85% and sensitivity of >40% is required to see a protective benefit of vaccination with no increase in the risk of missed infection. Data from experimentally infected animals suggest that this target specificity could be achieved in vaccinates using a cocktail of three DIVA antigens while maintaining a sensitivity of 73.3% (95% CI: 61.9, 82.9%) relative to post-mortem detection.",,,,"Jones, Gareth/C-6270-2011; Conlan, Andrew/Q-3861-2019; Vordermeier, H Martin/C-6936-2011; APHA, publications/E-6082-2010; Wood, James/A-1626-2008","Conlan, Andrew/0000-0002-2593-6353; Wood, James/0000-0002-0258-3188",,,,,,,,,,,,1553-7358,,,,,FEB,2015,11,2,,,,,,,e1004038,10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004038,,,,,,,,WOS:000352081000014,25695736,,,,,,15,17,65,6299,1535,1275,260,4764,4110,23,631,65,1,0,0,15,15,4

We present a curvilinear coordinate system that fully takes into account the helical symmetry of a DNA segment. The latter naturally allows to characterize the spatial organization and motions of ligands tracking the minor or major grooves, in a motion reminiscent of sliding. Using this approach, we performed umbrella sampling (US) molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to calculate the three-dimensional potentials of mean force (3D-PMFs) for a Na+ cation and for methyl guanidinium, an arginine analog. The computed PMFs show that, even for small ligands, the free energy landscapes are complex. In general, energy barriers of up to similar to 5 kcal/mol were measured for removing the ligands from the minor groove, and of similar to 1.5 kcal/mol for sliding along the minor groove. We shed light on the way the minor groove geometry, defined mainly by the DNA sequence, shapes the binding landscape around DNA, providing heterogeneous environments for recognition by various ligands. For example, we identified the presence of dissociation points or ""exit ramps"" that naturally would terminate sliding.

Phase separation in liquid-ordered and liquid-disordered domains was modeled by assigning two alternative ordering states to each lipid species and minimization of next-neighbor ordering energies. Parameterization of the model was performed such that experimentally determined diffusion rates and phases in ternary lipid mixtures of model membranes were correctly recapitulated.

The extraction of lipid patches from the bile salt soluble nanodomain into the bile reproduced observed biliary phospholipid compositions for a physiological membrane composition.

The impact of vaccine-induced immune responses can be investigated through sieve analysis of HIV-1 breakthrough infections (infected vaccine and placebo recipients). A V1/V2-targeted comparison of the genomes of HIV-1 breakthrough viruses identified two V2 amino acid sites that differed between the vaccine and placebo groups. Here we extended the V1/V2 analysis to the entire HIV-1 genome using an array of methods based on individual sites, k-mers and genes/proteins. We identified 56 amino acid sites or ""signatures"" and 119 k-mers that differed between the vaccine and placebo groups. Of those, 19 sites and 38 k-mers were located in the regions comprising the RV144 vaccine (Env-gp120, Gag, and Pro). The nine signature sites in Env-gp120 were significantly enriched for known antibody-associated sites (p = 0.0021). In particular, site 317 in the third variable loop (V3) overlapped with a hotspot of antibody recognition, and sites 369 and 424 were linked to CD4 binding site neutralization. The identified signature sites significantly covaried with other sites across the genome (mean = 32.1) more than did non-signature sites (mean = 0.9) (p < 0.0001), suggesting functional and/or structural relevance of the signature sites. Since signature sites were not preferentially restricted to the vaccine immunogens and because most of the associations were insignificant following correction for multiple testing, we predict that few of the genetic differences are strongly linked to the RV144 vaccine-induced immune pressure.

We hypothesized that the competition of viral strains at the epidemic level may involve an advantage of the resident strain that was the first to colonize a population. Such an effect would slow down the invasion of new strains, and thus also the diversification of the epidemic. We developed a stochastic modelling framework to simulate HIV epidemics over dynamic contact networks. We simulated epidemics in which the second strain was introduced into a population where the first strain had established a steady-state epidemic, and assessed whether, and on what time scale, the second strain was able to spread in the population. Simulations were parameterized based on empirical data; we tested scenarios with varying levels of overall prevalence. The spread of the second strain occurred on a much slower time scale compared with the initial expansion of the first strain. With strains of equal transmission efficiency, the second strain was unable to invade on a time scale relevant for the history of the HIV pandemic. To become dominant over a time scale of decades, the second strain needed considerable (>25%) advantage in transmission efficiency over the resident strain. The inhibition effect was weaker if the second strain was introduced while the first strain was still in its growth phase. We also tested how possible mechanisms of interference (inhibition of superinfection, depletion of highly connected hubs in the network, one-time acute peak of infectiousness) contribute to the inhibition effect. Our simulations confirmed a strong first comer advantage in the competition dynamics of HIV at the population level, which may explain the global phylogeography of the virus and may influence the future evolution of the pandemic.",,,,"Ferdinandy, Bence/F-9980-2011; Muller, Viktor/B-3493-2009","Ferdinandy, Bence/0000-0001-6895-9750; Muller, Viktor/0000-0001-8212-4880",,,,,,,,,,,,1553-734X,1553-7358,,,,FEB,2015,11,2,,,,,,,UNSP e1004093,10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004093,,,,,,,,WOS:000352081000037,25654450,,,,,,4,14,27,4912,400,307,93,4512,4038,29,445,27,3,0,0,4,4,0

Successful progression through the cell cycle depends on precise, temporally ordered regulation of the functions of these proteins. In light of this complexity, it is surprising that in fission yeast, a minimal Cdk network consisting of a single cyclin-Cdk fusion protein can control DNA synthesis and mitosis in a manner that is indistinguishable from wild type. To improve our understanding of the cell cycle regulatory network, we built and analysed a mathematical model of the molecular interactions controlling the G1/S and G2/M transitions in these minimal cells. The model accounts for all observed properties of yeast strains operating with the fusion protein. Importantly, coupling the model's predictions with experimental analysis of alternative minimal cells, we uncover an explanation for the unexpected fact that elimination of inhibitory phosphorylation of Cdk is benign in these strains while it strongly affects normal cells. Furthermore, in the strain without inhibitory phosphorylation of the fusion protein, the distribution of cell size at division is unusually broad, an observation that is accounted for by stochastic simulations of the model. Our approach provides novel insights into the organization and quantitative regulation of wild type cell cycle progression. In particular, it leads us to propose a new mechanistic model for the phenomenon of mitotic catastrophe, relying on a combination of unregulated, multi-cyclin-dependent Cdk activities.",,,,"Novak, Bela/D-5365-2009; Tyson, John J/A-2942-2014","Novak, Bela/0000-0002-6961-1366; Tyson, John J/0000-0001-7560-6013; Coudreuse, Damien/0000-0003-2534-1621",,,,,,,,,,,,1553-734X,1553-7358,,,,FEB,2015,11,2,,,,,,,UNSP e1004056,10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004056,,,,,,,,WOS:000352081000022,25658582,,,,,,25,0,85,10058,1534,1230,304,8524,6828,31,1665,84,0,1,0,21,21,0

An assessment of this workflow using benchmark datasets for the well-studied gamma-proteobacterium Escherichia coli showed that it outperforms expression-based inference approaches, having a significantly larger area under the precision-recall curve. Further analysis indicated that this integrated workflow captures different aspects of the E. coli TRN than expression-based approaches, potentially making them highly complementary. We leveraged this new workflow and observations to build a large-scale TRN model for the alpha-Proteobacterium Rhodobacter sphaeroides that comprises 120 gene clusters, 1211 genes (including 93 TFs), 1858 predicted protein-DNA interactions and 76 DNA binding motifs. We found that similar to 67% of the predicted gene clusters in this TRN are enriched for functions ranging from photosynthesis or central carbon metabolism to environmental stress responses. We also found that members of many of the predicted gene clusters were consistent with prior knowledge in R. sphaeroides and/or other bacteria. Experimental validation of predictions from this R. sphaeroides TRN model showed that high precision and recall was also obtained for TFs involved in photosynthesis (PpsR), carbon metabolism (RSP_0489) and iron homeostasis (RSP_3341). In addition, this integrative approach enabled generation of TRNs with increased information content relative to R. sphaeroides TRN models built via other approaches.

Structural studies have shown that in many cases, the inhibitor-bound protein adopts a conformation that is distinct from its unbound and its protein-bound conformations. This plasticity of the protein surface presents a major challenge in predicting which members of a protein family will be inhibited by a given ligand. Here, we use biased simulations of Bcl-2-family proteins to generate ensembles of low-energy conformations that contain surface pockets suitable for small molecule binding. We find that the resulting conformational ensembles include surface pockets that mimic those observed in inhibitor-bound crystal structures. Next, we find that the ensembles generated using different members of this protein family are overlapping but distinct, and that the activity of a given compound against a particular family member (ligand selectivity) can be predicted from whether the corresponding ensemble samples a complementary surface pocket. Finally, we find that each ensemble includes certain surface pockets that are not shared by any other family member: while no inhibitors have yet been identified to take advantage of these pockets, we expect that chemical scaffolds complementing these ""distinct"" pockets will prove highly selective for their targets.

Accumulating evidence, however, indicates that lactate produced in astrocytes (a type of glial cell) can also fuel neuronal activity. The quantitative aspects of this so-called astrocyte-neuron lactate shuttle (ANLS) are still debated. To address this question, we developed a detailed biophysical model of the brain's metabolic interactions. Our model integrates three modeling approaches, the Buxton-Wang model of vascular dynamics, the Hodgkin-Huxley formulation of neuronal membrane excitability and a biophysical model of metabolic pathways. This approach provides a template for large-scale simulations of the neuron-gliavasculature (NGV) ensemble, and for the first time integrates the respective timescales at which energy metabolism and neuronal excitability occur. The model is constrained by relative neuronal and astrocytic oxygen and glucose utilization, by the concentration of metabolites at rest and by the temporal dynamics of NADH upon activation. These constraints produced four observations. First, a transfer of lactate from astrocytes to neurons emerged in response to activity. Second, constrained by activity-dependent NADH transients, neuronal oxidative metabolism increased first upon activation with a subsequent delayed astrocytic glycolysis increase. Third, the model correctly predicted the dynamics of extracellular lactate and oxygen as observed in vivo in rats. Fourth, the model correctly predicted the temporal dynamics of tissue lactate, of tissue glucose and oxygen consumption, and of the BOLD signal as reported in human studies.

While several experimental studies on the Pdu system have provided hints about its organization, a clear picture of how all the individual components interact has not emerged yet.

We find that shell protein PduA is able to serve as a ""universal hub"" for targeting an array of enzymes presenting special N-terminal extensions, namely PduC, D, E, L and P. The varied N-terminal peptides are predicted to bind in the same cleft on the presumptive luminal face of the PduA hexamer. We also propose that PduV, a protein of unknown function with remote homology to the Ras-like GTPase superfamily, is likely to localize outside the MCP, interacting with the protruding beta-barrel of the hexameric PduU shell protein.

Moreover, the amount of activity changes significantly over the circadian rhythm, and hence the means, variances and autocorrelations are all time varying. A new methodology is presented. For example, to discern what is and what is not impacted by stimulation, velocity is classified (in a time-evolving manner) as being zero-, one- and two-dimensional movement. The most important conclusions of the paper are: (1) (DBS) stimulation is proven to be truly effective; (2) it is two-dimensional (2-D) movement that strongly differs between light and dark and responds to stimulation; and, (3) stimulation in the light initiates a manner of movement, 2-D movement, that is more commonly seen in the (non-stimulated) dark. Based upon these conclusions, it is conjectured that the above patterns of 2-D movement could be a straightforward, easy to calculate correlate of arousal.

Our results show that in this type of mesoscopic network excitation and inhibition spontaneously segregate, with some columns acting mainly in an excitatory manner while some others have predominantly an inhibitory effect on their neighbors. We characterize the conditions under which this segregation arises, and relate the character of the different columns with their topological role within the network.

To address this problem, cyclins-key molecules that regulate cell cycle transition-have been utilized. Herein, a novel integrated experimental-modelling platform is presented whereby experimental quantification of key cell cycle metrics (cell cycle timings, cell cycle fractions, and cyclin expression determined by flow cytometry) is used to develop a cyclin and DNA distributed model for the industrially relevant cell line, GS-NS0. Cyclins/DNA synthesis rates were linked to stimulatory/inhibitory factors in the culture medium, which ultimately affect cell growth. Cell antibody productivity was characterized using cell cycle-specific production rates. The solution method delivered fast computational time that renders the model's use suitable for model-based applications.

These range from humans, to social insects, to bacteria. The mechanisms involved, the quorum required, and the size of the group may vary. Here we address the general question of the evolution of collective signaling at a high level of abstraction. We investigate the evolutionary dynamics of a population engaging in a signaling N-person game theoretic model. Parameter settings allow for loners and cheaters, and for costly or costless signals. We find a rich dynamics, showing how natural selection, operating on a population of individuals endowed with the simplest strategies, is able to evolve a costly signaling system that allows individuals to respond appropriately to different states of Nature. Signaling robustly promotes cooperative collective action, in particular when coordinated action is most needed and difficult to achieve.

The coiled-coil motif that mediates homo-or hetero-dimerization of the bZIP proteins has been intensively studied, and a variety of methods have been proposed to predict these interactions from sequence data. In this work, we used a large quantitative set of 4,549 bZIP coiled-coil interactions to develop a predictive model that exploits knowledge of structurally conserved residue-residue interactions in the coiled-coil motif. Our model, which expresses interaction energies as a sum of interpretable residue-pair and triplet terms, achieves a correlation with experimental binding free energies of R = 0.68 and significantly out-performs other scoring functions. To use our model in protein design applications, we devised a strategy in which synthetic peptides are built by assembling 7-residue native-protein heptad modules into new combinations. An integer linear program was used to find the optimal combination of heptads to bind selectively to a target human bZIP coiled coil, but not to target paralogs. Using this approach, we designed peptides to interact with the bZIP domains from human JUN, XBP1, ATF4 and ATF5. Testing more than 132 candidate protein complexes using a fluorescence resonance energy transfer assay confirmed the formation of tight and selective heterodimers between the designed peptides and their targets.

At the same time, important classes of the realistic membrane-shaping proteins have strongly elongated shapes with large and highly anisotropic curvature. Here we investigated, computationally, the membrane mediated interaction between proteins or protein oligomers representing membrane scaffolds with strongly anisotropic curvature, and addressed, quantitatively, a specific case of the scaffold geometrical parameters characterizing BAR domains, which are crucial for membrane shaping in endocytosis. In addition to the previously analyzed contributions to the interaction, we considered a repulsive force stemming from the entropy of the scaffold orientation. We computed this interaction to be of the same order of magnitude as the well-known attractive force related to the entropy of membrane undulations. We demonstrated the scaffold shape anisotropy to cause a mutual aligning of the scaffolds and to generate a strong attractive interaction bringing the scaffolds close to each other to equilibrium distances much smaller than the scaffold size.

Molecular diagnostics and biomarker discovery should benefit particularly from the accurate quantification of proteomes, since complex diseases like cancer change protein abundances and modifications.

The mechanistic and functional relationship between these two basic neurophysiological signatures of working memory remains elusive. We propose that match signals are generated as a result of transient changes in local network excitability brought about by persistent activity. Neurons more active will be more excitable, and thus more responsive to external inputs. Accordingly, network responses are jointly determined by the incoming stimulus and the ongoing pattern of persistent activity. Using a spiking model network, we show that this mechanism is able to reproduce most of the experimental phenomenology of match effects as exposed by single-cell recordings during delayed-response tasks. The model provides a unified, parsimonious mechanistic account of the main neuronal correlates of working memory, makes several experimentally testable predictions, and demonstrates a new functional role for persistent activity.",,,,,"Mongillo, Gianluigi/0000-0002-6885-9394; Tartaglia, Elisa/0000-0002-0078-8163",,,,,,,,,,,,1553-734X,1553-7358,,,,FEB,2015,11,2,,,,,,,UNSP e1004059,10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004059,,,,,,,,WOS:000352081000024,25695777,,,,,,0,3,62,4757,936,730,206,3821,3204,24,593,62,0,0,0,0,0,0

Here we reconsider the available experimental data and note that it involves almost exclusively proteins with a single sector. We show that in this case sequence conservation is the dominating factor in SCA, and can alone be used to make statistically equivalent functional predictions.

It involves processes on multiple scales: the sub-cellular, cellular and tissue level, which interact via explicit or intrinsic feedback mechanisms. Computational modelling studies play an important role in unravelling the multiscale feedbacks underlying convergent extension. Convergent extension usually operates in tissue which has been patterned or is currently being patterned into distinct domains of gene expression. How such tissue patterns are maintained during the large scale tissue movements of convergent extension has thus far not been investigated. Intriguingly, experimental data indicate that in certain cases these tissue patterns may drive convergent extension rather than requiring safeguarding against convergent extension. Here we use a 2D Cellular Potts Model (CPM) of a tissue prepatterned into segments, to show that convergent extension tends to disrupt this pre-existing segmental pattern. However, when cells preferentially adhere to cells of the same segment type, segment integrity is maintained without any reduction in tissue extension. Strikingly, we demonstrate that this segment-specific adhesion is by itself sufficient to drive convergent extension. Convergent extension is enhanced when we endow our in silico cells with persistence of motion, which in vivo would naturally follow from cytoskeletal dynamics. Finally, we extend our model to confirm the generality of our results. We demonstrate a similar effect of differential adhesion on convergent extension in tissues that can only extend in a single direction (as often occurs due to the inertia of the head region of the embryo), and in tissues prepatterned into a sequence of domains resulting in two opposing adhesive gradients, rather than alternating segments.",,,,"ten Tusscher, Kirsten/B-9427-2011",,,,,,,,,,,,,1553-734X,1553-7358,,,,FEB,2015,11,2,,,,,,,UNSP e1004092,10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004092,,,,,,,,WOS:000352081000036,25706823,,,,,,8,0,30,2811,304,234,70,2507,2091,23,393,30,0,6,0,9,9,0

For twelve different main PTM-types and associated subtypes and across 9 diverse species, we investigated whether particular PTM-types are associated with proteins with specific and possibly ""strategic"" placements in the network of all protein interactions by determining informative network-theoretic properties. Proteins undergoing a PTM were observed to engage in more interactions and positioned in more central locations than non-PTM proteins. Among the twelve considered PTM-types, phosphorylated proteins were identified most consistently as being situated in central network locations and with the broadest interaction spectrum to proteins carrying other PTM-types, while glycosylated proteins are preferentially located at the network periphery. For the human interactome, proteins undergoing sumoylation or proteolytic cleavage were found with the most characteristic network properties. PTM-type-specific protein interaction network (PIN) properties can be rationalized with regard to the function of the respective PTM-carrying proteins. For example, glycosylation sites were found enriched in proteins with plasma membrane localizations and transporter or receptor activity, which generally have fewer interacting partners. The involvement in disease processes of human proteins undergoing PTMs was also found associated with characteristic PIN properties.

By projecting the receptor dynamics on these binary switches that yield 2(10) microstates, we show that (i) the receptors in apo, antagonist-bound, and agonist-bound states explore vastly different conformational space; (ii) among the three receptor states the apo state explores the broadest range of microstates; (iii) in the presence of the agonist, the active conformation is maintained through coherent couplings among the binary switches; and (iv) to be most specific, our analysis shows that W246, located deep inside the binding cleft, can serve as both an agonist sensor and actuator of ensuing intramolecular signaling for the receptor activation. Finally, our analysis of multiple trajectories generated by inserting an agonist to the apo state underscores that the transition of the receptor from inactive to active form requires the disruption of ionic-lock in the DRY motif.",,,,"Hyeon, Changbong/H-3295-2011","Hyeon, Changbong/0000-0002-4844-7237; Choi, Sun/0000-0002-7669-7954",,,,,,,,,,,,,1553-7358,,,,FEB,2015,11,2,,,,,,,e1004044,10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004044,,,,,,,,WOS:000352081000016,25664580,,,,,,15,0,32,4065,463,365,98,3602,2930,23,649,32,0,1,0,12,12,0

Recent experimental studies have shown that the precise frequency of gamma oscillations varies with input drive (e.g. visual contrast) and that it can differ among nearby cortical locations. This has challenged theories assuming widespread gamma synchronization at a fixed common frequency. In the present study, we investigated which principles govern gamma synchronization in the presence of input-dependent frequency modulations and whether they are detrimental for meaningful input-dependent gamma-mediated temporal organization. To this aim, we constructed a biophysically realistic excitatory-inhibitory network able to express different oscillation frequencies at nearby spatial locations. Similarly to cortical networks, the model was topographically organized with spatially local connectivity and spatially-varying input drive. We analyzed gamma synchronization with respect to phase-locking, phase-relations and frequency differences, and quantified the stimulus-related information represented by gamma phase and frequency. By stepwise simplification of our models, we found that the gamma-mediated temporal organization could be reduced to basic synchronization principles of weakly coupled oscillators, where input drive determines the intrinsic (natural) frequency of oscillators. The gamma phase-locking, the precise phase relation and the emergent (measurable) frequencies were determined by two principal factors: the detuning (intrinsic frequency difference, i.e. local input difference) and the coupling strength. In addition to frequency coding, gamma phase contained complementary stimulus information. Crucially, the phase code reflected input differences, but not the absolute input level. This property of relative input-to-phase conversion, contrasting with latency codes or slower oscillation phase codes, may resolve conflicting experimental observations on gamma phase coding. Our modeling results offer clear testable experimental predictions. We conclude that input-dependency of gamma frequencies could be essential rather than detrimental for meaningful gamma-mediated temporal organization of cortical activity.",,,,"Roberts, Mark/C-7011-2018","Roberts, Mark/0000-0001-7513-1281",,,,,,,,,,,,,1553-7358,,,,FEB,2015,11,2,,,,,,,UNSP e1004072,10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004072,,,,,,,,WOS:000352081000029,25679780,,,,,,19,2,68,6089,475,346,129,5614,4582,38,994,67,0,0,0,19,19,0

These changes can profoundly impact the functioning of a system ranging from controlled state switching to a catastrophic break-down; signals that predict critical transitions are therefore highly desirable. To this end, research efforts have focused on utilizing qualitative changes in markers related to a system's tendency to recover more slowly from a perturbation the closer it gets to the transition-a phenomenon called critical slowing down. The recently studied scaling of critical slowing down offers a refined path to understand critical transitions: to identify the transition mechanism and improve transition prediction using scaling laws. Here, we outline and apply this strategy for the first time in a real-world system by studying the transition to spiking in neurons of the mammalian cortex. The dynamical system approach has identified two robust mechanisms for the transition from subthreshold activity to spiking, saddle-node and Hopf bifurcation. Although theory provides precise predictions on signatures of critical slowing down near the bifurcation to spiking, quantitative experimental evidence has been lacking. Using whole-cell patch-clamp recordings from pyramidal neurons and fast-spiking interneurons, we show that 1) the transition to spiking dynamically corresponds to a critical transition exhibiting slowing down, 2) the scaling laws suggest a saddle-node bifurcation governing slowing down, and 3) these precise scaling laws can be used to predict the bifurcation point from a limited window of observation. To our knowledge this is the first report of scaling laws of critical slowing down in an experiment. They present a missing link for a broad class of neuroscience modeling and suggest improved estimation of tipping points by incorporating scaling laws of critical slowing down as a strategy applicable to other complex systems.",,,,"Kuehn, Christian/H-3950-2014","Kuehn, Christian/0000-0002-7063-6173; Klaus, Andreas/0000-0002-4133-351X",,,,,,,,,,,,1553-734X,1553-7358,,,,FEB,2015,11,2,,,,,,,e1004097,10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004097,,,,,,,,WOS:000352081000038,25706912,,,,,,16,3,52,5311,728,592,136,4583,3578,30,975,51,3,0,0,15,15,0

However, recent studies indicate that resting-state activity is not stationary, but shows complex temporal dynamics. We were interested in the spatiotemporal dynamics of the phase interactions among resting-state fMRI BOLD signals from human subjects. We found that the global phase synchrony of the BOLD signals evolves on a characteristic ultra-slow (<0.01Hz) time scale, and that its temporal variations reflect the transient formation and dissolution of multiple communities of synchronized brain regions. Synchronized communities reoccurred intermittently in time and across scanning sessions. We found that the synchronization communities relate to previously defined functional networks known to be engaged in sensory-motor or cognitive function, called restingstate networks (RSNs), including the default mode network, the somato-motor network, the visual network, the auditory network, the cognitive control networks, the self-referential network, and combinations of these and other RSNs. We studied the mechanism originating the observed spatiotemporal synchronization dynamics by using a network model of phase oscillators connected through the brain's anatomical connectivity estimated using diffusion imaging human data. The model consistently approximates the temporal and spatial synchronization patterns of the empirical data, and reveals that multiple clusters that transiently synchronize and desynchronize emerge from the complex topology of anatomical connections, provided that oscillators are heterogeneous.",,,,"Mantini, Dante/D-6989-2014; Ponce-Alvarez, Adrian/A-5698-2018; DECO, GUSTAVO/A-6341-2008","Mantini, Dante/0000-0001-6485-5559; Ponce-Alvarez, Adrian/0000-0003-1446-7392; DECO, GUSTAVO/0000-0002-8995-7583; CORBETTA, MAURIZIO/0000-0001-8295-3304",,,,,,,,,,,,,1553-7358,,,,FEB,2015,11,2,,,,,,,UNSP e1004100,10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004100,,,,,,,,WOS:000352081000041,25692996,,,,,,72,15,178,9207,768,541,227,8439,6500,26,1913,177,1,0,0,73,73,0

It has a rather complex propulsion mechanism and swims in diverse microenvironments. These continuously exert selective pressure, to which the trypanosome adjusts with its architecture and behavior. As a result, the trypanosome assumes a diversity of complex morphotypes during its life cycle. However, although cell biology has detailed form and function of most of them, experimental data on the dynamic behavior and development of most morphotypes is lacking. Here we show that simulation science can predict intermediate cell designs by conducting specific and controlled modifications of an accurate, nature-inspired cell model, which we developed using information from live cell analyses. The cell models account for several important characteristics of the real trypanosomal morphotypes, such as the geometry and elastic properties of the cell body, and their swimming mechanism using an eukaryotic flagellum. We introduce an elastic network model for the cell body, including bending rigidity and simulate swimming in a fluid environment, using the mesoscale simulation technique called multi-particle collision dynamics. The in silico trypanosome of the bloodstream form displays the characteristic in vivo rotational and translational motility pattern that is crucial for survival and virulence in the vertebrate host. Moreover, our model accurately simulates the trypanosome's tumbling and backward motion. We show that the distinctive course of the attached flagellum around the cell body is one important aspect to produce the observed swimming behavior in a viscous fluid, and also required to reach the maximal swimming velocity. Changing details of the flagellar attachment generates less efficient swimmers. We also simulate different morphotypes that occur during the parasite's development in the tsetse fly, and predict a flagellar course we have not been able to measure in experiments so far.",,,,,"Kruger, Timothy/0000-0001-5544-1098",,,,,,,,,,,,1553-734X,1553-7358,,,,JAN,2015,11,1,,,,,,,e1003967,10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003967,,,,,,,,WOS:000349309400004,25569823,,,,,,27,1,35,5772,520,418,102,5252,4610,33,609,35,1,9,0,29,29,0

The utility of these models depends in part on how well they can reproduce empirical data. However, fitting such models to real world data is greatly hindered both by large numbers of input and output parameters, and by long run times, such that many modelling studies lack a formal calibration methodology. We present a novel method that has the potential to improve the calibration of complex infectious disease models (hereafter called simulators). We present this in the form of a tutorial and a case study where we history match a dynamic, event-driven, individual-based stochastic HIV simulator, using extensive demographic, behavioural and epidemiological data available from Uganda. The tutorial describes history matching and emulation. History matching is an iterative procedure that reduces the simulator's input space by identifying and discarding areas that are unlikely to provide a good match to the empirical data. History matching relies on the computational efficiency of a Bayesian representation of the simulator, known as an emulator. Emulators mimic the simulator's behaviour, but are often several orders of magnitude faster to evaluate. In the case study, we use a 22 input simulator, fitting its 18 outputs simultaneously. After 9 iterations of history matching, a non-implausible region of the simulator input space was identified that was 1011 times smaller than the original input space. Simulator evaluations made within this region were found to have a 65% probability of fitting all 18 outputs. History matching and emulation are useful additions to the toolbox of infectious disease modellers. Further research is required to explicitly address the stochastic nature of the simulator as well as to account for correlations between outputs.",,,,"White, Richard G/D-5407-2009","White, Richard G/0000-0003-4410-6635; McCreesh, Nicky/0000-0003-1409-8531",,,,,,,,,,,,1553-734X,1553-7358,,,,JAN,2015,11,1,,,,,,,e1003968,10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003968,,,,,,,,WOS:000349309400005,25569850,,,,,,28,1,71,6374,648,478,170,5726,4608,37,1081,70,1,0,0,24,24,0

An important experimentally observed feature of this connectivity is the distribution of the number of synapses from one neuron to another, which has been measured in several cortical layers. All of these distributions are bimodal with one peak at zero and a second one at a small number (3-8) of synapses. In this study, using a probabilistic model of structural plasticity, which depends on the synaptic weights, we explore how these distributions can emerge and which functional consequences they have. We find that bimodal distributions arise generically from the interaction of structural plasticity with synaptic plasticity rules that fulfill the following biological realistic constraints: First, the synaptic weights have to grow with the postsynaptic activity. Second, this growth curve and/or the input-output relation of the postsynaptic neuron have to change sublinearly (negative curvature). As most neurons show such input-output-relations, these constraints can be fulfilled by many biological reasonable systems. Given such a system, we show that the different activities, which can explain the layer-specific distributions, correspond to experimentally observed activities. Considering these activities as working point of the system and varying the pre-or postsynaptic stimulation reveals a hysteresis in the number of synapses. As a consequence of this, the connectivity between two neurons can be controlled by activity but is also safeguarded against overly fast changes. These results indicate that the complex dynamics between activity and plasticity will, already between a pair of neurons, induce a variety of possible stable synaptic distributions, which could support memory mechanisms.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1553-734X,1553-7358,,,,JAN,2015,11,1,,,,,,,e1004031,10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004031,,,,,,,,WOS:000349309400020,25590330,,,,,,21,2,43,5959,1636,1383,253,4323,3667,30,626,42,0,0,0,17,17,0

The relative change in R0 due to an intervention is referred to as the effect size. However malaria and other diseases are often highly seasonal and some interventions have time-varying effects, meaning that simple reproduction number formulae cannot be used. Methods have recently been developed for calculating R0 for diseases with seasonally varying transmission. I extend those methods to calculate the effect size of repeated rounds of mass drug administration, indoor residual spraying and other interventions against Plasmodium falciparum malaria in seasonal settings in Africa. I show that if an intervention reduces transmission from one host to another by a constant factor, then its effect size is the same in a seasonal as in a non-seasonal setting. The optimal time of year for drug administration is in the low season, whereas the best time for indoor residual spraying or a vaccine which reduces infection rates is just before the high season. In general, the impact of time-varying interventions increases with increasing seasonality, if carried out at the optimal time of year. The effect of combinations of interventions that act at different stages of the transmission cycle is roughly the product of the separate effects. However for individual time-varying interventions, it is necessary to use methods such as those developed here rather than inserting the average efficacy into a simple formula.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1553-734X,1553-7358,,,,JAN,2015,11,1,,,,,,,e1004057,10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004057,,,,,,,,WOS:000349309400029,25590612,,,,,,13,1,46,4350,293,235,58,4057,3511,33,513,46,1,0,0,13,13,0

Regulatory interactions between genes and miRNAs are complex, as multiple miRNAs can regulate multiple genes. In addtion, these interactions vary from patient to patient and even among patients with the same cancer type, as cancer development is a heterogeneous process. These relationships are more complicated because transcription factors and other regulatory molecules can also regulate miRNAs and genes. Hence, it is important to identify the complex relationships between genes and miRNAs in cancer. In this study, we propose a computational approach to constructing modules that represent these relationships by integrating the expression data of genes and miRNAs with gene-gene interaction data. First, we used a biclustering algorithm to construct modules consisting of a subset of genes and a subset of samples to incorporate the heterogeneity of cancer cells. Second, we combined gene-gene interactions to include genes that play important roles in cancer-related pathways. Then, we selected miRNAs that are closely associated with genes in the modules based on a Gaussian Bayesian network and Bayesian Information Criteria.

It exibits a characteristic dumbell shape, with two globular domains (N- and C-terminal lobe) joined by a linker region. Each lobe can take alternative conformations, affected by the binding of calcium and target proteins. Calmodulin displays considerable functional flexibility due to its capability to bind different targets, often in a tissue-specific fashion. In various specific physiological environments (e.g. skeletal muscle, neuron dendritic spines) several targets compete for the same calmodulin pool, regulating its availability and affinity for calcium. In this work, we sought to understand the general principles underlying calmodulin modulation by different target proteins, and to account for simultaneous effects of multiple competing targets, thus enabling a more realistic simulation of calmodulin-dependent pathways. We built a mechanistic allosteric model of calmodulin, based on an hemiconcerted framework: each calmodulin lobe can exist in two conformations in thermodynamic equilibrium, with different affinities for calcium and different affinities for each target. Each lobe was allowed to switch conformation on its own. The model was parameterised and validated against experimental data from the literature. In spite of its simplicity, a two-state allosteric model was able to satisfactorily represent several sets of experiments, in particular the binding of calcium on intact and truncated calmodulin and the effect of different skMLCK peptides on calmodulin's saturation curve. The model can also be readily extended to include multiple targets. We show that some targets stabilise the low calcium affinity T state while others stabilise the high affinity R state. Most of the effects produced by calmodulin targets can be explained as modulation of a pre-existing dynamic equilibrium between different conformations of calmodulin's lobes, in agreement with linkage theory and MWC-type models.",,,,,"Le Novere, Nicolas/0000-0002-6309-7327",,,,,,,,,,,,1553-734X,1553-7358,,,,JAN,2015,11,1,,,,,,,e1004063,10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004063,,,,,,,,WOS:000349309400030,25611683,,,,,,7,0,27,4403,617,466,151,3786,3245,22,519,27,0,1,0,8,8,0

The pathogenesis of SSc and its progression are poorly understood. The SSc intrinsic gene expression subsets (inflammatory, fibroproliferative, normal-like, and limited) are observed in multiple clinical cohorts of patients with SSc. Analysis of longitudinal skin biopsies suggests that a patient's subset assignment is stable over 6-12 months. Genetically, SSc is multi-factorial with many genetic risk loci for SSc generally and for specific clinical manifestations. Here we identify the genes consistently associated with the intrinsic subsets across three independent cohorts, show the relationship between these genes using a gene-gene interaction network, and place the genetic risk loci in the context of the intrinsic subsets. To identify gene expression modules common to three independent datasets from three different clinical centers, we developed a consensus clustering procedure based on mutual information of partitions, an information theory concept, and performed a meta-analysis of these genome-wide gene expression datasets. We created a gene-gene interaction network of the conserved molecular features across the intrinsic subsets and analyzed their connections with SSc-associated genetic polymorphisms. The network is composed of distinct, but interconnected, components related to interferon activation, M2 macrophages, adaptive immunity, extracellular matrix remodeling, and cell proliferation. The network shows extensive connections between the inflammatory-and fibroproliferative-specific genes. The network also shows connections between these subset-specific genes and 30 SSc-associated polymorphic genes including STAT4, BLK, IRF7, NOTCH4, PLAUR, CSK, IRAK1, and several human leukocyte antigen (HLA) genes.

This holistic approach requires systems biology to scrutinize the effects of diet on tissue biology. To decipher the adipose tissue (AT) response to diet induced weight changes we focused on key molecular (lipids and transcripts) AT species during a longitudinal dietary intervention. To obtain a systems model, a network approach was used to combine all sets of variables (bio-clinical, fatty acids and mRNA levels) and get an overview of their interactions. AT fatty acids and mRNA levels were quantified in 135 obese women at baseline, after an 8-week low calorie diet (LCD) and after 6 months of ad libitum weight maintenance diet (WMD). After LCD, individuals were stratified a posteriori according to weight change during WMD. A 3 steps approach was used to infer a global model involving the 3 sets of variables. It consisted in inferring intra-omic networks with sparse partial correlations and inter-omic networks with regularized canonical correlation analysis and finally combining the obtained omic-specific network in a single global model. The resulting networks were analyzed using node clustering, systematic important node extraction and cluster comparisons. Overall, AT showed both constant and phase-specific biological signatures in response to dietary intervention. AT from women regaining weight displayed growth factors, angiogenesis and proliferation signaling signatures, suggesting unfavorable tissue hyperplasia. By contrast, after LCD a strong positive relationship between AT myristoleic acid (a fatty acid with low AT level) content and de novo lipogenesis mRNAs was found. This relationship was also observed, after WMD, in the group of women that continued to lose weight. This original system biology approach provides novel insight in the AT response to weight control by highlighting the central role of myristoleic acid that may account for the beneficial effects of weight loss.",,,,"Tvrzicka, Eva/Q-6300-2016; Viguerie, Nathalie/M-2422-2017","Tvrzicka, Eva/0000-0003-0794-8454; Caspar-Bauguil, Sylvie/0000-0003-2682-0704; Langin, Dominique/0000-0002-2669-7825; Viguerie, Nathalie/0000-0002-1730-9915",,,,,,,,,,,,1553-734X,1553-7358,,,,JAN,2015,11,1,,,,,,,e1004047,10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004047,,,,,,,,WOS:000349309400027,25590576,,,,,,14,3,35,5659,1187,855,332,4472,3800,39,633,33,0,0,0,11,11,0

Several datasets that include both pharmacologic profiles of cancer cell lines as well as their genomic alterations have been recently developed and extensively analyzed. However, most analyses of these datasets assume that mutations in a gene will have the same consequences regardless of their location. While this assumption might be correct in some cases, such analyses may miss subtler, yet still relevant, effects mediated by mutations in specific protein regions. Here we study such perturbations by separating effects of mutations in different protein functional regions (PFRs), including protein domains and intrinsically disordered regions. Using this approach, we have been able to identify 171 novel associations between mutations in specific PFRs and changes in the activity of 24 drugs that couldn't be recovered by traditional gene-centric analyses. Our results demonstrate how focusing on individual protein regions can provide novel insights into the mechanisms underlying the drug sensitivity of cancer cell lines. Moreover, while these new correlations are identified using only data from cancer cell lines, we have been able to validate some of our predictions using data from actual cancer patients.

Within the MEC spatial representations, including grid and directional firing fields, have a laminar and dorsoventral organization that corresponds to a similar topography of neuronal connectivity and cellular properties. Yet, in part due to the challenges of integrating anatomical data at the resolution of cortical layers and borders, we know little about the molecular components underlying this organization. To address this we develop a new computational pipeline for high-throughput analysis and comparison of in situ hybridization (ISH) images at laminar resolution. We apply this pipeline to ISH data for over 16,000 genes in the Allen Brain Atlas and validate our analysis with RNA sequencing of MEC tissue from adult mice. We find that differential gene expression delineates the borders of the MEC with neighboring brain structures and reveals its laminar and dorsoventral organization. We propose a new molecular basis for distinguishing the deep layers of the MEC and show that their similarity to corresponding layers of neocortex is greater than that of superficial layers. Our analysis identifies ion channel-, cell adhesion-and synapse-related genes as candidates for functional differentiation of MEC layers and for encoding of spatial information at different scales along the dorsoventral axis of the MEC. We also reveal laminar organization of genes related to disease pathology and suggest that a high metabolic demand predisposes layer II to neurodegenerative pathology. In principle, our computational pipeline can be applied to high-throughput analysis of many forms of neuro-anatomical data.

Localized releases of calcium through clusters of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor channels constitute elementary signals called calcium puffs. Coupling by diffusing calcium leads to global releases and waves, but the exact mechanism of inter-cluster coupling and triggering of waves is unknown. To elucidate the relation of puffs and waves, we here model a cluster of IP3R channels using a gating scheme with variable non-equilibrium IP3 binding. Hybrid stochastic and deterministic simulations show that puffs are not stereotyped events of constant duration but are sensitive to stimulation strength and residual calcium. For increasing IP3 concentration, the release events become modulated at a timescale of minutes, with repetitive wave-like releases interspersed with several puffs. This modulation is consistent with experimental observations we present, including refractoriness and increase of puff frequency during the inter-wave interval. Our results suggest that waves are established by a random but time-modulated appearance of sustained release events, which have a high potential to trigger and synchronize activity throughout the cell.",,,,"Marchant, Jonathan/C-3642-2019; MARCHANT, Jonathan/B-8051-2009; Marchant, Jonathan/Q-5484-2019","Marchant, Jonathan/0000-0001-6592-0877; MARCHANT, Jonathan/0000-0001-6592-0877; Marchant, Jonathan/0000-0001-6592-0877",,,,,,,,,,,,,1553-7358,,,,JAN,2015,11,1,,,,,,,e1003965,10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003965,,,,,,,,WOS:000349309400003,25569772,,,,,,18,0,26,3291,331,235,96,2960,2551,35,374,26,0,0,2,19,19,0

In rodents, visual neurons show highly selective responses to oriented stimuli, but neighboring neurons do not necessarily have similar preferences. Instead of a smooth map, one observes a salt-and-pepper organization of orientation selectivity. Modeling studies have recently confirmed that balanced random networks are indeed capable of amplifying weakly tuned inputs and generating highly selective output responses, even in absence of feature-selective recurrent connectivity. Here we seek to elucidate the neuronal mechanisms underlying this phenomenon by resorting to networks of integrate-and-fire neurons, which are amenable to analytic treatment. Specifically, in networks of perfect integrate-and-fire neurons, we observe that highly selective and contrast invariant output responses emerge, very similar to networks of leaky integrate-and-fire neurons. We then demonstrate that a theory based on mean firing rates and the detailed network topology predicts the output responses, and explains the mechanisms underlying the suppression of the common-mode, amplification of modulation, and contrast invariance. Increasing inhibition dominance in our networks makes the rectifying nonlinearity more prominent, which in turn adds some distortions to the otherwise essentially linear prediction. An extension of the linear theory can account for all the distortions, enabling us to compute the exact shape of every individual tuning curve in our networks. We show that this simple form of nonlinearity adds two important properties to orientation selectivity in the network, namely sharpening of tuning curves and extra suppression of the modulation. The theory can be further extended to account for the nonlinearity of the leaky model by replacing the rectifier by the appropriate smooth input-output transfer function. These results are robust and do not depend on the state of network dynamics, and hold equally well for mean-driven and fluctuation-driven regimes of activity.",,,,,"Sadeh, Sadra/0000-0001-8159-5461",,,,,,,,,,,,1553-734X,1553-7358,,,,JAN,2015,11,1,,,,,,,e1004045,10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004045,,,,,,,,WOS:000349309400026,25569445,,,,,,7,2,37,4345,365,254,111,3980,3329,35,616,37,1,0,0,8,8,0

Cancer-driving mutations are usually discriminated from passenger mutations by their higher degree of recurrence in tumor samples. However, there is increasing evidence that many additional driver mutations may exist that occur at very low frequencies among tumors. This observation has prompted alternative methods for driver detection, including finding groups of mutually exclusive mutations and incorporating prior biological knowledge about gene function or network structure. Dependencies among drivers due to epistatic interactions can also result in low mutation frequencies, but this effect has been ignored in driver detection so far. Here, we present a new computational approach for identifying genomic alterations that occur at low frequencies because they depend on other events. Unlike passengers, these constrained mutations display punctuated patterns of occurrence in time. We test this driver-passenger discrimination approach based on mutation timing in extensive simulation studies, and we apply it to cross-sectional copy number alteration (CNA) data from ovarian cancer, CNA and single-nucleotide variant (SNV) data from breast tumors and SNV data from colorectal cancer. Among the top ranked predicted drivers, we find low-frequency genes that have already been shown to be involved in carcinogenesis, as well as many new candidate drivers.

In silico analysis of this dual objective design space reveals that there is no single global optimum with respect to protein deimmunization. Instead, mutagenic epitope deletion yields a spectrum of designs that exhibit tradeoffs between immunogenic potential and molecular function. The leading edge of this design space is the Pareto frontier, i.e. the undominated variants for which no other single design exhibits better performance in both criteria. Here, the Pareto frontier of a therapeutic enzyme has been designed, constructed, and evaluated experimentally.

Using the electrosensory system of gymnotiform weakly electric fish, we recorded the activities of pyramidal cell pairs within the electrosensory lateral line lobe (ELL) under spatially localized and diffuse stimulation. We found that both signal and noise correlations were markedly reduced (>40%) under the latter stimulation. Through a network model incorporating key anatomical features of the ELL, we reveal how activation of diffuse parallel fiber feedback from granule cells by spatially diffuse stimulation can explain both the reduction in signal as well as the reduction in noise correlations seen experimentally through independent mechanisms. First, we show that burst-timing dependent plasticity, which leads to a negative image of the stimulus and thereby reduces single neuron responses, decreases signal but not noise correlations. Second, we show trial-to-trial variability in the responses of single granule cells to sensory input reduces noise but not signal correlations. Thus, our model predicts that the same feedback pathway can simultaneously reduce both signal and noise correlations through independent mechanisms. To test this prediction experimentally, we pharmacologically inactivated parallel fiber feedback onto ELL pyramidal cells. In agreement with modeling predictions, we found that inactivation increased both signal and noise correlations but that there was no significant relationship between magnitude of the increase in signal correlations and the magnitude of the increase in noise correlations. The mechanisms reported in this study are expected to be generally applicable to the cerebellum as well as other cerebellum-like structures.

Brief external perturbations lead to adaptive, long-term modification of intrinsic network connectivity through long-term excitatory plasticity, whereas long-term inhibitory plasticity enables rapid self-tuning of the network back to a critical state.

It is easily recognized that it is the direct basis for computational enzyme kinetics, ecological systems models, and models for the spread of diseases. The article reviews the explicit and implicit role of the law of mass action in systems biology and reveals how the original, more general formulation of the law emerged one hundred years later ab initio as a very general, canonical representation of biological processes.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1553-734X,1553-7358,,,,JAN,2015,11,1,,,,,,,e1004012,10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004012,,,,,,,,WOS:000349309400010,25569257,,,,,,38,17,113,11332,2557,2186,371,8775,7225,31,1519,108,17,0,0,29,29,0

For example, as of summer 2013, MG-RAST has been used to annotate over 110,000 data sets totaling over 43 Terabases. With metagenomic sequencing finding even wider adoption in the scientific community, the existing web-based analysis tools and infrastructure in MG-RAST provide limited capability for data retrieval and analysis, such as comparative analysis between multiple data sets. Moreover, although the system provides many analysis tools, it is not comprehensive. By opening MG-RAST up via a web services API (application programmers interface) we have greatly expanded access to MG-RAST data, as well as provided a mechanism for the use of third-party analysis tools with MG-RAST data. This RESTful API makes all data and data objects created by the MG-RAST pipeline accessible as JSON objects. As part of the DOE Systems Biology Knowledgebase project (KBase, http://kbase.us) we have implemented a web services API for MG-RAST. This API complements the existing MG-RAST web interface and constitutes the basis of KBase's microbial community capabilities. In addition, the API exposes a comprehensive collection of data to programmers. This API, which uses a RESTful (Representational State Transfer) implementation, is compatible with most programming environments and should be easy to use for end users and third parties. It provides comprehensive access to sequence data, quality control results, annotations, and many other data types. Where feasible, we have used standards to expose data and metadata. Code examples are provided in a number of languages both to show the versatility of the API and to provide a starting point for users. We present an API that exposes the data in MG-RAST for consumption by our users, greatly enhancing the utility of the MG-RAST service.",,,,"Wilke, Andreas/F-1816-2018","Wilke, Andreas/0000-0002-7699-2267",,,,,,,,,,,,1553-734X,1553-7358,,,,JAN,2015,11,1,,,,,,,e1004008,10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004008,,,,,,,,WOS:000349309400009,25569221,,,,,,26,21,136,11380,2028,1720,308,9352,8240,59,1053,132,20,0,0,26,26,3

Identifying the origin of atrial ectopic activity from the electrocardiogram (ECG) can help to diagnose the early onset of AF in a cost-effective manner. The complex and rapid atrial electrical activity during AF makes it difficult to obtain detailed information on atrial activation using the standard 12-lead ECG alone. Compared to conventional 12-lead ECG, more detailed ECG lead configurations may provide further information about spatio-temporal dynamics of the body surface potential (BSP) during atrial excitation. We apply a recently developed 3D human atrial model to simulate electrical activity during normal sinus rhythm and ectopic pacing. The atrial model is placed into a newly developed torso model which considers the presence of the lungs, liver and spinal cord. A boundary element method is used to compute the BSP resulting from atrial excitation. Elements of the torso mesh corresponding to the locations of the placement of the electrodes in the standard 12-lead and a more detailed 64-lead ECG configuration were selected. The ectopic focal activity was simulated at various origins across all the different regions of the atria. Simulated BSP maps during normal atrial excitation (i.e. sinoatrial node excitation) were compared to those observed experimentally (obtained from the 64-lead ECG system), showing a strong agreement between the evolution in time of the simulated and experimental data in the P-wave morphology of the ECG and dipole evolution. An algorithm to obtain the location of the stimulus from a 64-lead ECG system was developed. The algorithm presented had a success rate of 93%, meaning that it correctly identified the origin of atrial focus in 75/80 simulations, and involved a general approach relevant to any multi-lead ECG system. This represents a significant improvement over previously developed algorithms.",,,,"Langley, Philip/I-1200-2019","Higham, Jonathan/0000-0002-9779-9968",,,,,,,,,,,,,1553-7358,,,,JAN,2015,11,1,,,,,,,e1004026,10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004026,,,,,,,,WOS:000349309400016,25611350,,,,,,15,1,31,5391,969,744,225,4422,3837,28,557,31,0,0,0,7,7,1

This is partially due to the complexity of the process, involving extensive molecular networks, multiple feedbacks between different scales of organization and physical forces operating at multiple levels. Here we present a conceptual and modeling framework aimed at generating an integrated understanding of morphogenesis in plants. This framework is based on the biophysical properties of plant cells, which are under high internal turgor pressure, and are prevented from bursting because of the presence of a rigid cell wall. To control cell growth, the underlying molecular networks must interfere locally with the elastic and/or plastic extensibility of this cell wall. We present a model in the form of a three dimensional (3D) virtual tissue, where growth depends on the local modulation of wall mechanical properties and turgor pressure. The model shows how forces generated by turgor-pressure can act both cell autonomously and non-cell autonomously to drive growth in different directions. We use simulations to explore lateral organ formation at the shoot apical meristem. Although different scenarios lead to similar shape changes, they are not equivalent and lead to different, testable predictions regarding the mechanical and geometrical properties of the growing lateral organs. Using flower development as an example, we further show how a limited number of gene activities can explain the complex shape changes that accompany organ outgrowth.",,,,"Boudon, Frederic/E-6812-2015; Boudaoud, Arezki/Q-7436-2016; Godin, Christophe/C-1218-2008","Boudaoud, Arezki/0000-0002-2780-4717; Godin, Christophe/0000-0002-1202-8460; Ali, Olivier/0000-0001-7671-7225",,,,,,,,,,,,,1553-7358,,,,JAN,2015,11,1,,,,,,,e1003950,10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003950,,,,,,,,WOS:000349309400002,25569615,,,,,,49,0,100,7730,888,679,209,6842,5697,33,1112,100,0,18,0,43,43,0

The protein cereblon, which forms an E3 ubiquitin ligase compex together with damaged DNA-binding protein 1 (DDB1) and cullin 4A, has been recently indentified as a primary target of thalidomide and its C-terminal part as responsible for binding thalidomide within a domain carrying several invariant cysteine and tryptophan residues. This domain, which we name CULT (cereblon domain of unknown activity, binding cellular ligands and thalidomide), is also found in a family of secreted proteins from animals and in a family of bacterial proteins occurring primarily in delta-proteobacteria. Its nearest relatives are yippee, a highly conserved eukaryotic protein of unknown function, and Mis18, a protein involved in the priming of centromeres for recruitment of CENP-A. Searches for distant homologs point to an evolutionary relationship of CULT, yippee, and Mis18 to proteins sharing a common fold, which consists of two four-stranded beta-meanders packing at a roughly right angle and coordinating a zinc ion at their apex. A beta-hairpin inserted into the first beta-meander extends across the bottom of the structure towards the C-terminal edge of the second b-meander, with which it forms a cradle-shaped binding site that is topologically conserved in all members of this fold. We name this the beta-tent fold for the striking arrangement of its constituent beta-sheets. The fold has internal pseudosymmetry, raising the possibility that it arose by duplication of a subdomain-sized fragment.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1553-734X,1553-7358,,,,JAN,2015,11,1,,,,,,,e1004023,10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004023,,,,,,,,WOS:000349309400014,25569776,,,,,,14,0,38,7520,2089,1624,465,5431,4583,34,814,38,0,0,0,13,13,0

Human performance on memory tasks is severely limited; however, the two major classes of theory explaining the limits leave open questions about key issues such as how multiple simultaneously-represented items can be distinguished. We propose a palimpsest model, with the occurrent activity of a single population of neurons coding for several multi-featured items. Using a probabilistic approach to storage and recall, we show how this model can account for many qualitative aspects of existing experimental data. In our account, the underlying nature of a memory item depends entirely on the characteristics of the population representation, and we provide analytical and numerical insights into critical issues such as multiplicity and binding. We consider representations in which information about individual feature values is partially separate from the information about binding that creates single items out of multiple features. An appropriate balance between these two types of information is required to capture fully the different types of error seen in human experimental data.

Here we analyze the behavior of asymmetrical connected networks of linear threshold neurons, whose positive response is unbounded. We show that, for a wide range of parameters, this asymmetry brings interesting and computationally useful dynamical properties. When driven by input, the network explores potential solutions through highly unstable 'expansion' dynamics. This expansion is steered and constrained by negative divergence of the dynamics, which ensures that the dimensionality of the solution space continues to reduce until an acceptable solution manifold is reached. Then the system contracts stably on this manifold towards its final solution trajectory. The unstable positive feedback and cross inhibition that underlie expansion and divergence are common motifs in molecular and neuronal networks. Therefore we propose that very simple organizational constraints that combine these motifs can lead to spontaneous computation and so to the spontaneous modification of entropy that is characteristic of living systems.",,,,,"Rutishauser, Ueli/0000-0002-9207-7069",,,,,,,,,,,,1553-734X,1553-7358,,,,JAN,2015,11,1,,,,,,,e1004039,10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004039,,,,,,,,WOS:000349309400023,25617645,,,,,,6,7,51,6607,449,297,152,6158,4718,35,1405,50,1,0,0,7,7,1

Despite the large experimental effort devoted to understanding the phenomenon of prion transmissibility, it is still poorly understood how this property is encoded in the primary sequence. In many cases, prion structural conversion is driven by the presence of relatively large glutamine/asparagine (Q/N) enriched segments. Several studies suggest that it is the amino acid composition of these regions rather than their specific sequence that accounts for their priogenicity. However, our analysis indicates that it is instead the presence and potency of specific short amyloid-prone sequences that occur within intrinsically disordered Q/N-rich regions that determine their prion behaviour, modulated by the structural and compositional context. This provides a basis for the accurate identification and evaluation of prion candidate sequences in proteomes in the context of a unified framework for amyloid formation and prion propagation.",,,,"Rousseau, Frederic/J-9044-2016; Ventura, Salvador/C-7021-2008; Schymkowitz, Joost/K-7764-2016; sabate, raimon/I-7849-2014","Rousseau, Frederic/0000-0002-9189-7399; Ventura, Salvador/0000-0002-9652-6351; Schymkowitz, Joost/0000-0003-2020-0168; sabate, raimon/0000-0003-3894-2362",,,,,,,,,,,,1553-7358,,,,,JAN,2015,11,1,,,,,,,e1004013,10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004013,,,,,,,,WOS:000349309400011,25569335,,,,,,33,5,93,8199,1361,1067,294,6838,5715,36,1087,92,5,0,0,31,31,0

The application of existing methods is commonly based on implicit assumptions on the biological processes under study. First, the measurements of mRNA abundance obtained in transcriptomics experiments are taken to be representative of protein concentrations. Second, the observed changes in gene expression are assumed to be solely due to transcription factors and other specific regulators, while changes in the activity of the gene expression machinery and other global physiological effects are neglected. While convenient in practice, these assumptions are often not valid and bias the reverse engineering process. Here we systematically investigate, using a combination of models and experiments, the importance of this bias and possible corrections. We measure in real time and in vivo the activity of genes involved in the FliA-FlgM module of the E. coli motility network. From these data, we estimate protein concentrations and global physiological effects by means of kinetic models of gene expression. Our results indicate that correcting for the bias of commonly-made assumptions improves the quality of the models inferred from the data. Moreover, we show by simulation that these improvements are expected to be even stronger for systems in which protein concentrations have longer half-lives and the activity of the gene expression machinery varies more strongly across conditions than in the FliA-FlgM module. The approach proposed in this study is broadly applicable when using time-series transcriptome data to learn about the structure and dynamics of regulatory networks. In the case of the FliA-FlgM module, our results demonstrate the importance of global physiological effects and the active regulation of FliA and FlgM half-lives for the dynamics of FliA-dependent promoters.",,,,,"Geiselmann, Johannes/0000-0002-1329-7558",,,,,,,,,,,,,1553-7358,,,,JAN,2015,11,1,,,,,,,e1004028,10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004028,,,,,,,,WOS:000349309400018,25590141,,,,,,12,0,54,4866,653,495,158,4213,3618,28,567,54,0,0,0,8,8,0
