We now show, by Biolayer Interferometry, that human insulin can bind the L1 subdomain (insulin binding domain) of recombinant (r) SjIR1 and rSjIR2 (designated SjLD1 and SjLD2) produced using the Drosophila S2 protein expression system. We have then used RNA interference (RNAi) to knock down the expression of the SjIRs in adult S. japonicum in vitro and show that, in addition to their reduced transcription, the transcript levels of other important downstream genes within the insulin pathway, associated with glucose metabolism and schistosome fecundity, were also impacted substantially. Further, a significant decrease in glucose uptake was observed in the SjIR-knockdown worms compared with luciferase controls. In vaccine/challenge experiments, we found that rSjLD1 and rSjLD2 depressed female growth, intestinal granuloma density and faecal egg production in S. japonicum in mice presented with a low dose challenge infection. These data re-emphasize the potential of the SjIRs as veterinary transmission blocking vaccine candidates against zoonotic schistosomiasis japonica in China and the Philippines.","[You, Hong; Gobert, Geoffrey N.; Cai, Pengfei; Nawaratna, Sujeevi; McManus, Donald P.] QIMR Berghofer Med Res Inst, Div Infect Dis, Mol Parasitol Lab, Brisbane, Qld, Australia; [Mou, Rong] Guiyang Med Univ, Dept Parasitol, Guiyang 550004, Peoples R China; [Fang, Guofu; Villinger, Francois] Emory Univ, Yerkes Natl Primate Res Ctr, Emory Vaccine Ctr, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA; [Villinger, Francois] Emory Univ, Sch Med, Dept Pathol, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA","You, H (reprint author), QIMR Berghofer Med Res Inst, Div Infect Dis, Mol Parasitol Lab, Brisbane, Qld, Australia.",Hong.You@qimrberghofer.edu.au; Don.McManus@qimrberghofer.edu.au,"McManus, Donald P./G-2678-2013; Gobert, Geoffrey/V-2985-2019","Gobert, Geoffrey/0000-0001-5884-6453",NHMRC [APP103704],"This work was funded by an NHMRC Program Grant (APP103704) entitled ""Tropical disease immunity pathogenesis and vaccine and drug delivery"", (http://www.nhmrc.gov.au/).

Icterohaemorrhagiae has been throughout recent history, and still is, the predominant serogroup of this pathogen in China. However, very little in detail is known about the serovars or genotypes of this serogroup. Methodology/Principal Findings In this study, 120 epidemic strains from five geographically diverse regions in China collected over a 50 year period (1958 similar to 2008), and 8 international reference strains characterized by 16S rRNA sequencing and MLST analysis. 115, 11 and 2 strains were identified as L. interrogans, L. borgpetersenii, and L. kirschneri, respectively. 17 different STs were identified including 69 ST1 strains, 18 ST17, 18 ST128, 9 ST143 and 2 ST209. The remaining 12 strains belonged to 12 different STs. eBURST analysis demonstrated that, among the clonal complexes isolated (CCs), CC1 accounted for 73.3%(88/120) strains representing three STs: ST1, ST128 and ST98. ST1 was the most likely ancestral strain of this CC, followed by singleton CC17 (17/120) and CC143 (11/120). Further analysis of adding 116 serogroup Icterohaemorrhagiae strains in the MLST database and studies previously described using global eBURST analysis and MST dendrogram revealed relatively similar ST clustering patterns with five main CCs and 8 singletons among these 244 strains. CC17 was found to be the most prevalent clone of pathogenic Leptospira circulating worldwide. This is the first time, to our knowledge, that ST1 and ST17 strains were distributed among 4 distinct serovars, indicating a highly complicated relationship between serovars and STs. Conclusions/Significance Our studies demonstrated a high level of genetic diversity in the serogroup Icterohaemorrhagiae strains. Distinct from ST17 or ST37 circulating elsewhere, ST1 included in CC1, has over the past 50 years or so, proven to be the most prevalent ST of pathogenic leptospires isolated in China. Moreover, the complicated relationship between STs and serovars indicates an urgent need to develop an improved scheme for Leptospira serotyping.","[Zhang, Cuicai; Li, Xiuwen; Cao, Zhiqiang; Zhou, Haijian; Jiang, Xiugao] Chinese Ctr Dis Control & Prevent, Natl Inst Communicable Dis Control & Prevent, State Key Lab Infect Dis Prevent & Control, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Cuicai; Li, Xiuwen; Cao, Zhiqiang; Zhou, Haijian; Jiang, Xiugao] Collaborat Innovat Ctr Diag & Treatment Infect Di, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Yang, Huimian] Mentougou Dist Ctr Dis Control & Prevent, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Zeng, Linzi] SiChuan Prov Ctr Dis Control & Prevent, Chengdu, Peoples R China; [Xu, Jianmin] JiangXi Prov Ctr Dis Control & Prevent, Nanchang, Peoples R China; [Xu, Yinghua] Natl Inst Food & Drug Control, Key Lab, Minist Hlth Res Qual & Standardizat Biotech Prod, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Chang, Yung-Fu] Cornell Univ, Coll Vet Med, Dept Populat Med & Diagnost Sci, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Guo, Xiaokui; Zhu, Yongzhang] Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Sch Med, Inst Med Sci, Dept Microbiol & Immunol, Shanghai 200030, Peoples R China","Zhang, CC (reprint author), Chinese Ctr Dis Control & Prevent, Natl Inst Communicable Dis Control & Prevent, State Key Lab Infect Dis Prevent & Control, Beijing, Peoples R China.",microbiology@sjtu.edu; yzhzhu@hotmail.com; jiangxiugao@icdc.cn,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China [81471968, 81271793, 81171587]; National Science and Technology Major Project on Infectious Disease Control and Prevention [2013ZX10004-101, 2012ZX10004-215]","This work was partly supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (81471968, 81271793 and 81171587), National Science and Technology Major Project on Infectious Disease Control and Prevention 2013ZX10004-101 and 2012ZX10004-215.

This redirection is consistent with the growing consensus among the dengue-prevention community that no single intervention will be sufficient to control dengue disease. The PDC's expectation is that when an effective dengue virus (DENV) vaccine is commercially available, the public health community will continue to rely on vector control because the two strategies complement and enhance one another. Although the concept of integrated intervention for dengue prevention is gaining increasingly broader acceptance, to date, no consensus has been reached regarding the details of how and what combination of approaches can be most effectively implemented to manage disease. To fill that gap, the PDC proposed a three step process: (1) a critical assessment of current vector control tools and those under development, (2) outlining a research agenda for determining, in a definitive way, what existing tools work best, and (3) determining how to combine the best vector control options, which have systematically been defined in this process, with DENV vaccines. To address the first step, the PDC convened a meeting of international experts during November 2013 in Washington, DC, to critically assess existing vector control interventions and tools under development. This report summarizes those deliberations.","[Achee, Nicole L.; Perkins, T. Alex] Univ Notre Dame, Dept Biol Sci, Notre Dame, IN 46556 USA; [Achee, Nicole L.; Perkins, T.

In order to effectively use this standardized nomenclature, a reproducible genotyping strategy is imperative. Several typing schemes have been developed with variable levels of complexity, selectivity and analytical sensitivity. Most of them can be only applied cultured stocks. In this context, we aimed to develop a multiplex Real-Time PCR method to identify the six T. cruzi DTUs using TaqMan probes (MTq-PCR). Methods/Principal Findings The MTq-PCR has been evaluated in 39 cultured stocks and 307 biological samples from vectors, reservoirs and patients from different geographical regions and transmission cycles in comparison with a multi-locus conventional PCR algorithm. The MTq-PCR was inclusive for laboratory stocks and natural isolates and sensitive for direct typing of different biological samples from vectors, reservoirs and patients with acute, congenital infection or Chagas reactivation. The first round SL-IR MTq-PCR detected 1 fg DNA/reaction tube of TcI, TcII and TcIII and 1 pg DNA/reaction tube of TcIV, TcV and TcVI reference strains. The MTq-PCR was able to characterize DTUs in 83% of triatomine and 96% of reservoir samples that had been typed by conventional PCR methods. Regarding clinical samples, 100% of those derived from acute infected patients, 62.5% from congenitally infected children and 50% from patients with clinical reactivation could be genotyped. Sensitivity for direct typing of blood samples from chronic Chagas disease patients (32.8% from asymptomatic and 22.2% from symptomatic patients) and mixed infections was lower than that of the conventional PCR algorithm. Conclusions/Significance Typing is resolved after a single or a second round of Real-Time PCR, depending on the DTU. This format reduces carryover contamination and is amenable to quantification, automation and kit production.","[Cura, Carolina I.; Duffy, Tomas; Bisio, Margarita; Schijman, Alejandro G.] Consejo Nacl Invest Cient & Tecn, Lab Biol Mol Enfermedad Chagas, Inst Invest Ingn Genet & Biol Mol Dr Hector N Tor, RA-1033 Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [Lucero, Raul H.] Univ Nacl Nordeste, Inst Med Reg, Resistencia, Chaco, Argentina; [Peneau, Julie; Aznar, Christine] Lab Hosp & Univ CH Andree Rosemon, Cayenne, French Guiana; [Jimenez-Coello, Matilde; Acosta Viana, Karla Y.] Univ Autonoma Yucatan, Ctr Invest Reg Dr Hideyo Noguchi, Lab Biol Celular, Merida, Yucatan, Mexico; [Calabuig, Eva] Hosp Politecn LA FE, Serv Med Interna, Valencia, Spain; [Gimenez, Maria J.] Hosp Univ & Politecn LA FE, Microbiol Serv, Valencia, Spain; [Valencia Ayala, Edward; Malaga Machaca, Edith S.] Univ Peruana Cayetano Heredia, Lab Invest Enfermedades Infecciosas, Lima, Peru; [Kjos, Sonia A.] Univ Minnesota, Dept Biol, Duluth, MN 55812 USA; [Santalla, Jose] Minist Salud & Deportes Bolivia, Inst Nacl Labs Salud, Lab Parasitol, La Paz, Bolivia; [Mahaney, Susan M.; VandeBerg, John L.] Texas Biomed Res Inst, Southwest Natl Primate Res Ctr, San Antonio, TX USA; [Mahaney, Susan M.; VandeBerg, John L.] Texas Biomed Res Inst, Dept Genet, San Antonio, TX USA; [Cayo, Nelly M.; Ocampo, Susana B.] Univ Nacl Jujuy, Inst Biol Altura, San Salvador De Jujuy, Argentina; [Nagel, Claudia] Hosp Univ Fdn Favaloro, Epidemiol & Infectol Clin, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [Barcan, Laura] Hosp Italiano Buenos Aires, Serv Clin Med, Secc Infectol, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [Brutus, Laurent] Inst Rech Dev, Paris, France; [Brutus, Laurent] Univ Paris 05, UMR 216, Mother & Child Facing Trop Dis, Paris, France; [Cuba Cuba, Cesar A.] Univ Brasilia, Fac Med, Area Patol, Parasitol Med & Biol Vetores, Brasilia, DF, Brazil; [Guertler, Ricardo E.] Univ Buenos Aires, Fac Ciencias Exactas & Nat, Dept Ecol Genet & Evoluc, Lab Ecoepidemiol, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [Ramsey, Janine M.] Inst Nacl Salud Publ, Ctr Reg Invest Salud Publ, Tapachula, Chiapas, Mexico; [Ribeiro, Isabela] Drugs & Neglected Dis Initiat, Geneva, Switzerland; [Yadon, Zaida E.] WHO, PAHO, Washington, DC USA; [Osuna, Antonio] Univ Granada, Inst Biotechnol, Mol Parasitol Grp, Granada, Spain","Cura, CI (reprint author), Consejo Nacl Invest Cient & Tecn, Lab Biol Mol Enfermedad Chagas, Inst Invest Ingn Genet & Biol Mol Dr Hector N Tor, RA-1033 Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina.",schijman@dna.uba.ar,"Duffy, Tomas/S-6045-2017; Brutus, Laurent/A-7430-2011; Osuna, Antonio/H-1896-2015","Brutus, Laurent/0000-0002-9967-0666; Valencia Ayala, Edward/0000-0002-5318-5526; Yadon, Zaida Estela/0000-0001-5093-5611; Jimenez-Coello, Matilde/0000-0002-8802-2049; Osuna, Antonio/0000-0002-3818-1471; Calabuig, Eva/0000-0002-0177-0037","Ministry of Science and Technology of Argentina [PICT 2011-0207]; National Scientific and Technical Research Council in Argentina (CONICET) [PIP 112 2011-010-0974]; Pan-American Health Organization (PAHO) [Small Grants Program PAHO-TDR]; Drugs and Neglected Diseases Initiative (DNDi, Geneva, Switzerland); Wellcome Trust (London, United Kingdom); SANOFI-AVENTIS (Buenos Aires, Argentina); National Council for Science and Technology in Mexico (CONACYT) [FONSEC 161405]","This work received financial support from the Ministry of Science and Technology of Argentina [PICT 2011-0207 to AGS] and the National Scientific and Technical Research Council in Argentina (CONICET) [PIP 112 2011-010-0974 to AGS].

Methodology and findings We have already shown that the entomopathogenic fungus Beauveria bassiana has the ability to breach the insect cuticle and is effective both against pyrethroid-susceptible and pyrethroid- resistant T. infestans, in laboratory as well as field assays. It is also known that T. infestans cuticle lipids play a major role as contact aggregation pheromones. We estimated the effectiveness of pheromone-based infection boxes containing B. bassiana spores to kill indoor bugs, and its effect on the vector population dynamics. Laboratory assays were performed to estimate the effect of fungal infection on female reproductive parameters. The effect of insect exuviae as an aggregation signal in the performance of the infection boxes was estimated both in the laboratory and in the field. We developed a stage-specific matrix model of T. infestans to describe the fungal infection effects on insect population dynamics, and to analyze the performance of the biopesticide device in vector biological control. Conclusions The pheromone-containing infective box is a promising new tool against indoor populations of this Chagas disease vector, with the number of boxes per house being the main driver of the reduction of the total domestic bug population. This ecologically safe approach is the first proven alternative to chemical insecticides in the control of T. infestans. The advantageous reduction in vector population by delayed-action fungal biopesticides in a contained environment is here shown supported by mathematical modeling.","[Forlani, Lucas; Pedrini, Nicolas; Girotti, Juan R.; Patricia Juarez, M.] UNLP, CCT La Plata, CONICET, Inst Invest Bioquim La Plata INIBIOLP,Fac Ciencia, La Plata, Buenos Aires, Argentina; [Cardozo, Ruben M.] Univ Nacl Salta, Fac Ciencias Salud, Inst Patol Expt, Salta, Argentina; [Cardozo, Ruben M.; Gentile, Alberto G.] Minist Salud Publ, Coordinac Gest Epidemiol, Salta, Argentina; [Hernandez-Suarez, Carlos M.] Univ Colima, Fac Ciencias, Colima, Mexico; [Rabinovich, Jorge E.] UNLP, CCT La Plata, CONICET, Ctr Estud Parasitol & Vectores CEPAVE, La Plata, Buenos Aires, Argentina","Forlani, L (reprint author), UNLP, CCT La Plata, CONICET, Inst Invest Bioquim La Plata INIBIOLP,Fac Ciencia, La Plata, Buenos Aires, Argentina.",mjuarez@isis.unlp.edu.ar,"Pedrini, Nicolas/Q-6386-2019","Pedrini, Nicolas/0000-0002-5383-8611","Agencia Nacional de Promocion Cientifica y Tecnologica, Argentina [PICT 2007-01503, PICT 2008-0035]","The research was supported in part by grants PICT 2007-01503 to MPJ and PICT 2008-0035 to JER, both from the Agencia Nacional de Promocion Cientifica y Tecnologica, Argentina (http://www.agencia.mincyt.gob.ar/frontend/agencia/fondo/foncyt).

This insecticide remains a primary control tool for several countries and it is a potential reliable reserve, for emergency epidemics or new invasion cases, in regions such as Europe which have banned its use. Resistance to temephos has been detected in some regions, but the mechanism responsible for the trait has not been investigated. Principal findings Temephos resistance was identified in an Aedes albopictus population isolated from Greece, and subsequently selected in the laboratory for a few generations. Biochemical assays suggested the association of elevated carboxylesterases (CCE), but not target site resistance (altered AChE), with this phenotype. Illumina transcriptomic analysis revealed the up-regulation of three transcripts encoding CCE genes in the temephos resistant strain. CCEae3a and CCEae6a showed the most striking up-regulation (27- and 12-folds respectively, compared to the reference susceptible strain); these genes have been previously shown to be involved in temephos resistance also in Ae. aegypti. Gene amplification was associated with elevated transcription levels of both CCEae6a and CCEae3a genes. Genetic crosses confirmed the genetic link between CCEae6a and CCEae3a amplification and temephos resistance, by demonstrating a strong association between survival to temephos exposure and gene copy numbers in the F2 generation. Other transcripts, encoding cytochrome P450s, UDP-glycosyltransferases (UGTs), cuticle and lipid biosynthesis proteins, were upregulated in resistant mosquitoes, indicating that the co-evolution of multiple mechanisms might contribute to resistance. Significance The identification of specific genes associated with insecticide resistance in Ae. albopictus for the first time is an important pre-requirement for insecticide resistance management. The genomic resources that were produced will be useful to the community, to study relevant aspects of Ae. albopictus biology.","[Grigoraki, Linda; Kampouraki, Anastasia; Morou, Evangelia] Univ Crete, Dept Biol, Iraklion, Greece; [Grigoraki, Linda; Vontas, John] Fdn Res & Technol Hellas, Inst Mol Biol & Biotechnol, Iraklion, Greece; [Lagnel, Jacques] Hellen Ctr Marine Res, Iraklion, Greece; [Kioulos, Ilias; Vontas, John] Agr Univ Athens, Dept Crop Sci, Pesticide Sci Lab, GR-11855 Athens, Greece; [Labbe, Pierrick; Weill, Mylene] Univ Montpellier, CNRS, IRD, Inst Sci Evolut, F-34059 Montpellier, France","Grigoraki, L (reprint author), Univ Crete, Dept Biol, Iraklion, Greece.",vontas@imbb.forth.gr,,"Labbe, Pierrick/0000-0003-0806-1919; Grigoraki, Linda/0000-0001-8997-0406; Weill, Mylene/0000-0002-4043-1601; Vontas, John/0000-0002-8704-2574; Kampouraki, Anastasia/0000-0001-6702-2544",European Union [228421]; bilateral Greece-France Cooperation Program [1641],"The research received funding from the European Union FP7 (2013) under grant agreement no 228421 to INFRAVEC (http://www.infravec.eu/) and a bilateral Greece-France Cooperation Program (no 1641) (www.gsrt.gr).

In addition to the development of improved whole organism screens, the success of RNA interference (RNAi) in schistosomes offers great promise for the identification of potential drug targets to initiate drug discovery. In this study we set out to contribute to RNAi based validation of putative drug targets. Initially a list of 24 target candidates was compiled based on the identification of putative essential genes in schistosomes orthologous of C. elegans essential genes. Knockdown of Calmodulin (Smp_026560.2) (Sm-Calm), that topped this list, produced a phenotype characterised by waves of contraction in adult worms but no phenotype in schistosomula. Knockdown of the atypical Protein Kinase C (Smp_096310) (Sm-aPKC) resulted in loss of viability in both schistosomula and adults and led us to focus our attention on other kinase genes that were identified in the above list and through whole organism screening of known kinase inhibitor sets followed by chemogenomic evaluation. RNAi knockdown of these kinase genes failed to affect adult worm viability but, like Sm-aPKC, knockdown of Polo-like kinase 1, Sm-PLK1 (Smp_009600) and p38-MAPK, Sm-MAPK p38 (Smp_133020) resulted in an increased mortality of schistosomula after 2-3 weeks, an effect more marked in the presence of human red blood cells (hRBC). For Sm-PLK-1 the same effects were seen with the specific inhibitor, BI2536, which also affected viable egg production in adult worms. For Sm-PLK-1 and Sm-aPKC the in vitro effects were reflected in lower recoveries in vivo. We conclude that the use of RNAi combined with culture with hRBC is a reliable method for evaluating genes important for larval development. However, in view of the slow manifestation of the effects of Sm-aPKC knockdown in adults and the lack of effects of Sm-PLK-1 and Sm-MAPK p38 on adult viability, these kinases may not represent suitable drug targets.","[Guidi, Alessandra; Mansour, Nuha R.; Paveley, Ross A.; Bickle, Quentin D.] London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, Dept Infect & Immun, London WC1, England; [Carruthers, Ian M.; Besnard, Jeremy; Hopkins, Andrew L.; Gilbert, Ian H.] Univ Dundee, Coll Life Sci, Div Biol Chem & Drug Discovery, Dundee, Scotland","Guidi, A (reprint author), London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, Dept Infect & Immun, London WC1, England.",alessandra.guidi@lshtm.ac.uk,"Guidi, Alessandra/P-1348-2018","Gilbert, Ian/0000-0002-5238-1314; Besnard, Jeremy/0000-0001-5452-8183",Gates Foundation [51052]; Medical Research Council [MR/K025430/1],"This work was funded by the Gates Foundation (grant no: 51052). http://www.gatesfoundation.org/.

It remains unknown whether a boosting regimen can maintain protection in previously immunized populations. This study examines the immunogenicity and safety of an OCV regimen given five years following initial dosing. Methodology/Principal Findings An open label controlled trial was conducted in 426 healthy Indian participants previously enrolled in a large efficacy trial. To assess whether an OCV regimen given after five years can elicit an antibody response equal to that of a primary series, we compared vibriocidal antibody titers in previously immunized participants receiving a two dose booster regimen to participants receiving a primary two dose immunization series. Among participants receiving a two dose primary series of OCV (n = 186), 69% (95% CI 62%-76%) seroconverted. In the intervention arm (n = 184), 66% (95% CI 59%-73%) seroconverted following a two dose boosting schedule given five years following the initial series. Following a single boosting dose, 71% (95% CI 64%-77%) seroconverted. Children demonstrated 79% (95% CI 69%-86%) and 82% (95% CI 73%-88%) seroconversion after primary and boosting regimens, respectively. Conclusions/Significance Administration of an OCV boosting regimen elicits an immune response similar to those receiving a primary series in endemic areas. Though a single boosting dose induces a strong immune response, further investigations are needed to measure if these findings translate to clinical protection.","[Kanungo, Suman; Saha, Jayanta; Nandy, Ranjan Kumar; Sinha, Anuradha; Manna, Byomkesh; Ali, Mohammad; Sur, Dipika] Natl Inst Cholera & Enter Dis, Kolkata, India; [Desai, Sachin N.; Kim, Deok Ryun; Bannerjee, Barnali; Yang, Jae Seung; Wierzba, Thomas F.] Int Vaccine Inst, Seoul, South Korea; [Ali, Mohammad] Johns Hopkins Bloomberg Sch Publ Hlth, Baltimore, MD USA; [Sur, Dipika] PATH India Off, New Delhi, India","Kanungo, S (reprint author), Natl Inst Cholera & Enter Dis, Kolkata, India.",sdesai@ivi.int,"Ali, Mohammad/E-2365-2017","Ali, Mohammad/0000-0003-1410-388X",Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation [OPP52797],"This work was supported by a grant from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation (OPP52797).

Our objective was to document the prevalence of parasitic infections and examine their association with growth during the first three years of life among children in coastal Kenya. Methodology/Principal Findings Children enrolled in a maternal-child cohort were tested for soil transmitted helminths (STHs: Ascaris, Trichuris, hookworm, Strongyloides), protozoa (malaria, Entamoeba histolytica and Giardia lamblia), filaria, and Schistosoma infection every six months from birth until age three years. Anthropometrics were measured at each visit. We used generalized estimating equation (GEE) models to examine the relationship between parasitic infections experienced in the first three years of life and growth outcomes (weight, length and head circumference). Of 545 children, STHs were the most common infection with 106 infections (19%) by age three years. Malaria followed in period prevalence with 68 infections (12%) by three years of age. Filaria and Schistosoma infection occurred in 26 (4.8%) and 16 (2.9%) children, respectively. Seven percent were infected with multiple parasites by three years of age. Each infection type (when all STHs were combined) was documented by six months of age. Decreases in growth of weight, length and head circumference during the first 36 months of life were associated with hookworm, Ascaris, E. histolytica, malaria and Schistosoma infection. In a subset analysis of 180 children who followed up at every visit through 24 months, infection with any parasite was associated with decelerations in weight, length and head circumference growth velocity. Multiple infections were associated with greater impairment of linear growth. Conclusions/Significance Our results demonstrate an under-recognized burden of parasitism in the first three years of childhood in rural Kenya. Parasitic infection and polyparasitism were common, and were associated with a range of significant growth impairment in terms of weight, length and/or head circumference.","[LaBeaud, A.

Recently, this bacterium has been detected in other arthropod families such as bed bugs, which begs the question of their involvement in B. quintana transmission. Although several infectious pathogens have been reported and are suggested to be transmitted by bed bugs, the evidence regarding their competence as vectors is unclear. Methodology/ Principal Findings Bed bugs at the adult and instar developmental stages were fed three successive human blood meals inoculated with B. quintana bacterium from day one (D1) to D5; subsequently they were fed with pathogen-free human blood until the end of the experiment. Bed bugs and feces were collected in time series, to evaluate their capacities to acquire, multiply and expel viable B. quintana using molecular biology, immunohistochemistry and cultures assays. B. quintana was detected molecularly in 100% of randomly selected experimentally infected bed bug specimens (D3). The monitoring of B. quintana in bed bug feces showed that the bacterium was detectable starting on the 3rd day post-infection (pi) and persisted until day 18 +/- 1 pi. Although immunohistochemistry assays localized the bacteria to the gastrointestinal bed bug gut, the detection of B. quintana in the first and second instar larva stages suggested a vertical non-transovarial transmission of the bacterium. Conclusion The present work demonstrated for the first time that bed bugs can acquire, maintain for more than 2 weeks and release viable B. quintana organisms following a stercorarial shedding. We also observed the vertical transmission of the bacterium to their progeny. Although the biological role of bed bugs in the transmission of B. quintana under natural conditions has yet to be confirmed, the present work highlights the need to reconsider monitoring of these arthropods for the transmission of human pathogens.","[Leulmi, Hamza; Berenger, Jean Michel; Lepidi, Hubert; Rolain, Jean Marc; Almeras, Lionel; Raoult, Didier; Parola, Philippe] Aix Marseille Univ, WHO, Collaborat Ctr Rickettsioses & Other Arthropod Bo, URMITE,UM63,CNRS 7278,IRD 198 Dakar,Inserm 1095, Marseille, France; [Leulmi, Hamza; Bitam, Idir] Ecole Natl Super Vet Alger, Algiers, Algeria; [Bitam, Idir] Univ Boumerdes, Lab VALCORE, Fac Sci, Boumerdes, Algeria; [Bitam, Idir] Univ Bab Ezzouar, Lab Ecol & Environm, Algiers, Algeria","Leulmi, H (reprint author), Aix Marseille Univ, WHO, Collaborat Ctr Rickettsioses & Other Arthropod Bo, URMITE,UM63,CNRS 7278,IRD 198 Dakar,Inserm 1095, Marseille, France.",philippe.parola@univ-amu.fr,"Berenger, Jean-Michel/W-3619-2019","raoult, didier/0000-0002-0633-5974; ALMERAS, Lionel/0000-0003-0490-5774",,,,50,29,32,2,35,PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE,SAN FRANCISCO,"1160 BATTERY STREET, STE 100, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94111 USA",1935-2735,,,PLOS NEGLECT TROP D,Plos Neglect.

The objective of this study was to compare the impact of single and double dose praziquantel (PZQ) treatment on cure rates (CRs), egg reduction rates (ERRs) and reinfection rates 8 months later, in children aged 1-5 years living along Lake Victoria, Uganda. Methodology/Principal Findings Infected children (n=1017) were randomized to receive either a single or double dose of PZQ. Initially all children were treated with a single standard oral dose 40 mg/kg body weight of PZQ. Two weeks later a second dose was administered to children in the double dose treatment arm. Side effects were monitored at 30 minutes to 24 hours after each treatment. Efficacy in terms of CRs and ERRs for the two treatments was assessed and compared 1 month after the second treatment. Re-infection with S. mansoni was assessed in the same children 8 months following the second treatment. CRs were non-significantly higher in children treated with two 40 mg/kg PZQ doses (85.5%; 290/339) compared to a single dose (83.2%; 297/357). ERRs were significantly higher in the double dose with 99.3 (95% CI: 99.2-99.5) compared with 98.9 (95% CI: 98.7-99.1) using a single dose, (P =0.01). Side effects occurred more frequently during the first round of drug administration and were mild and short-lived; these included vomiting, abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea. Overall re-infection rate 8 months post treatment was 44.5%. Conclusions PZQ is efficacious and relatively safe to use in preschool-age children but there is still an unmet need to improve its formulation to suit small children. Two PZQ doses lead to significant reduction in egg excretion compared to a single dose. Re-infection rates with S. mansoni 8 months post treatment is the same among children irrespective of the treatment regimen.","[Nalugwa, Allen] Makerere Univ, Child Hlth & Dev Ctr, Kampala, Uganda; [Nuwaha, Fred] Makerere Univ, Dis Control & Prevent, Kampala, Uganda; [Tukahebwa, Edridah Muheki] Minist Hlth, Vector Control Div, Kampala, Uganda; [Olsen, Annette] Univ Copenhagen, Dept Vet Dis Biol, Frederiksberg, Denmark","Nalugwa, A (reprint author), Makerere Univ, Child Hlth & Dev Ctr, Kampala, Uganda.",analugwa@chdc.mak.ac.ug,,"Olsen, Annette/0000-0001-9352-621X",Danish Ministry of Foreign Affairs [09-100KU],"This study was supported by the Danish Ministry of Foreign Affairs- Project No. 09-100KU.

In such co-endemic regions, successful malaria control programs have a greater impact on reducing falciparum malaria, resulting in P. vivax becoming the predominant species of infection. Adding to the challenges of elimination, the dormant liver stage complicates efforts to monitor the impact of ongoing interventions against P. vivax. We investigated molecular approaches to inform the respective transmission dynamics of P. falciparum and P. vivax and how these could help to prioritize public health interventions. Methodology/Principal Findings Genotype data generated at 8 and 9 microsatellite loci were analysed in 168 P. falciparum and 166 P. vivax isolates, respectively, from four co-endemic sites in Indonesia (Bangka, Kalimantan, Sumba and West Timor). Measures of diversity, linkage disequilibrium (LD) and population structure were used to gauge the transmission dynamics of each species in each setting. Marked differences were observed in the diversity and population structure of P. vivax versus P. falciparum. In Bangka, Kalimantan and Timor, P. falciparum diversity was low, and LD patterns were consistent with unstable, epidemic transmission, amenable to targeted intervention. In contrast, P. vivax diversity was higher and transmission appeared more stable. Population differentiation was lower in P. vivax versus P. falciparum, suggesting that the hypnozoite reservoir might play an important role in sustaining local transmission and facilitating the spread of P. vivax infections in different endemic settings. P. vivax polyclonality varied with local endemicity, demonstrating potential utility in informing on transmission intensity in this species. Conclusions/Significance Molecular approaches can provide important information on malaria transmission that is not readily available from traditional epidemiological measures.

It has been a rural disease, but indigenous urban cases have been observed in Seoul, South Korea. Urban scrub typhus may have a significant impact because of the large population. Methods Indigenous urban scrub typhus was epidemiologically identified in Seoul, the largest metropolitan city in South Korea, using national notifiable disease data from 2010 to 2013. For detailed analysis of clinical features, patients from one hospital that reported the majority of cases were selected and compared to a historic control group. Chigger mites were prospectively collected in the city using a direct chigger mite-collecting trap, and identified using both phenotypic and 18S rDNA sequencing analyses. Their infection with Orientia tsutsugamushi was confirmed by sequencing the 56-kDa antigen gene. Results Eighty-eight cases of urban scrub typhus were determined in Seoul. The possible sites of infection were mountainous areas (56.8%), city parks (20.5%), the vicinity of one's own residence (17.0%), and riversides (5.7%). Eighty-seven chigger mites were collected in Gwanak mountain, one of the suspected infection sites in southern Seoul, and seventy-six (87.4%) of them were identified as Helenicula miyagawai and eight (9.2%) as Leptotrombidium scutellare. Pooled DNA extracted from H. miyagawai mites yielded O. tsutsugamushi Boryong strain. Twenty-six patients from one hospital showed low APACHE II score (3.4 +/- 2.7), low complication rate (3.8%), and no hypokalemia. Conclusions We identified the presence of indigenous urban scrub typhus in Seoul, and a subgroup of them had mild clinical features. The chigger mite H. miyagawai infected with O. tsutsugamushi within the city was found. In endemic area, urban scrub typhus needs to be considered as one of the differential febrile diseases and a target for prevention.","[Park, Sang-Won; Oh, Myoung-don] Seoul Natl Univ, Coll Med, Dept Internal Med, Seoul 151, South Korea; [Park, Sang-Won; Bang, Ji Hwan] Boramae Med Ctr, Dept Internal Med, Seoul, South Korea; [Ha, Na-Young; Song, Hoyeon; Kim, Yuri; Kim, Gwanghun; Cho, Nam-Hyuk] Seoul Natl Univ, Coll Med, Dept Microbiol & Immunol, Seoul 151, South Korea; [Ha, Na-Young; Song, Hoyeon; Kim, Yuri; Kim, Gwanghun; Cho, Nam-Hyuk] Seoul Natl Univ, Coll Med, Dept Biomed Sci, Seoul 151, South Korea; [Ha, Na-Young; Song, Hoyeon; Kim, Yuri; Kim, Gwanghun; Cho, Nam-Hyuk] Bundang Hosp, Seoul, South Korea; [Ryu, Boyeong] Seoul Natl Univ, Coll Med, Med Res Ctr, Seoul 151, South Korea; [Ryu, Boyeong; Bang, Ji Hwan; Oh, Myoung-don; Lee, Jong-koo] Seoul Ctr Infect Dis Control, Seoul, South Korea; [Lee, Jong-koo] Seoul Natl Univ, Coll Med, Dept Family Med, Seoul 151, South Korea","Park, SW (reprint author), Seoul Natl Univ, Coll Med, Dept Internal Med, Seoul 151, South Korea.",chonh@snu.ac.kr; docmohw@snu.ac.kr,"PARK, SANG WON/J-5485-2012","PARK, SANG WON/0000-0002-0550-1897",Seoul metropolitan city [80020140448],"This study was supported by funding from the grant of Seoul metropolitan city (No. 80020140448; www.seoul.go.kr; JkL), but the funder had no role in study design, data collection and analysis, decision to publish, or preparation of the manuscript.",,42,18,18,0,12,PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE,SAN FRANCISCO,"1160 BATTERY STREET, STE 100, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94111 USA",1935-2735,,,PLOS NEGLECT TROP D,Plos Neglect.

The situation of dengue in China has become more and more severe, with an unprecedented dengue outbreak hitting south China in 2014. Building a dengue early warning system is therefore urgent and necessary for timely and effective response. Methodology and Principal Findings In the study we developed a time series Poisson multivariate regression model using imported dengue cases, local minimum temperature and accumulative precipitation to predict the dengue occurrence in four districts of Guangzhou, China. The time series data were decomposed into seasonal, trend and remainder components using a seasonal-trend decomposition procedure based on loess (STL). The time lag of climatic factors included in the model was chosen based on Spearman correlation analysis. Autocorrelation, seasonality and long-term trend were controlled in the model. A best model was selected and validated using Generalized Cross Validation (GCV) score and residual test. The data from March 2006 to December 2012 were used to develop the model while the data from January 2013 to September 2014 were employed to validate the model. Time series Poisson model showed that imported cases in the previous month, minimum temperature in the previous month and accumulative precipitation with three month lags could project the dengue outbreaks occurred in 2013 and 2014 after controlling the autocorrelation, seasonality and long-term trend. Conclusions Together with the sole transmission vector Aedes albopictus, imported cases, monthly minimum temperature and monthly accumulative precipitation may be used to develop a low-cost effective early warning system.","[Sang, Shaowei; Gu, Shaohua; Xu, Lei; Yang, Jun; Liu, Xiaobo; Wu, Haixia; Liu, Qiyong] Chinese Ctr Dis Control & Prevent, Natl Inst Communicable Dis Control & Prevent, Collaborat Innovat Ctr Diag & Treatment Infect Di, State Key Lab Infect Dis Prevent & Control, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Sang, Shaowei; Liu, Qiyong] Shandong Univ, Climate Change & Hlth Ctr, Jinan 250100, Shandong, Peoples R China; [Bi, Peng] Univ Adelaide, Sch Populat Hlth, Adelaide, SA, Australia; [Yang, Weizhong; Liu, Qiyong] Chinese Ctr Dis Control & Prevent, Div Infect Dis, Key Lab Surveillance & Early Warning Infect Dis, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Yang, Zhicong] Guangzhou Ctr Dis Control & Prevent, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Jiang, Tong] China Meteorol Adm, Natl Climate Ctr, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Chu, Cordia; Liu, Qiyong] Griffith Univ, Ctr Environm & Populat Hlth, Nathan, Qld 4111, Australia","Sang, SW (reprint author), Chinese Ctr Dis Control & Prevent, Natl Inst Communicable Dis Control & Prevent, Collaborat Innovat Ctr Diag & Treatment Infect Di, State Key Lab Infect Dis Prevent & Control, Beijing, Peoples R China.",c.chu@griffith.edu.au; liuqiyong@icdc.cn,"Yang, Jun/Q-3037-2019","Bi, Peng/0000-0002-3238-3427","National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program) [2012CB955504, 2012CB955903]; National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [81273139]; Special Research Program for Health [201202006]; State Key Laboratory for Infectious Disease Prevention and Control [2014SKLID106]","This study was supported by the National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program) (Grant No. 2012CB955504; No. 2012CB955903); the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) (Grant No. 81273139); the Special Research Program for Health (Grant No. 201202006) and the State Key Laboratory for Infectious Disease Prevention and Control (Grant No. 2014SKLID106).

The present study aimed to evaluate the antigenicity and prophylactic properties of the Leishmania infantum Poly (A) binding proteins (LiPABPs). Methodology/Principal Findings Three different members of the LiPABP family have been described. Recombinant tools based on these proteins were constructed: recombinant proteins and DNA vaccines. The three recombinant proteins were employed for coating ELISA plates. Sera from human and canine patients of visceral leishmaniasis and human patients of mucosal leishmaniasis recognized the three LiPABPs. In addition, the protective efficacy of a DNA vaccine based on the combination of the three Leishmania PABPs has been tested in a model of progressive murine leishmaniasis: BALB/c mice infected with Leishmania major. The induction of a Th1-like response against the LiPABP family by genetic vaccination was able to down-regulate the IL-10 predominant responses elicited by parasite LiPABPs after infection in this murine model. This modulation resulted in a partial protection against L. major infection. LiPABP vaccinated mice showed a reduction on the pathology that was accompanied by a decrease in parasite burdens, in antibody titers against Leishmania antigens and in the IL-4 and IL-10 parasite-specific mediated responses in comparison to control mice groups immunized with saline or with the non-recombinant plasmid. Conclusion/Significance The results presented here demonstrate for the first time the prophylactic properties of a new family of Leishmania antigenic intracellular proteins, the LiPABPs. The redirection of the immune response elicited against the LiPABP family (from IL-10 towards IFN-gamma mediated responses) by genetic vaccination was able to induce a partial protection against the development of the disease in a highly susceptible murine model of leishmaniasis.","[Soto, Manuel; Corvo, Laura; Garde, Esther; Ramirez, Laura; Bonay, Pedro; Alonso, Carlos] Univ Autonoma Madrid, Dept Biol Mol, Ctr Biol Mol Severo Ochoa CSIC UAM, Madrid, Spain; [Iniesta, Virginia; Gomez-Nieto, Carlos] Univ Extremadura, Parasitol Unit, Fac Vet, LeishmanCeres Lab GLP Compliance Certified, Caceres, Spain; [Gonzalez, Victor M.; Elena Martin, M.] Hosp Ramon & Cajal, IRYCIS, Dept Bioquim Invest, E-28034 Madrid, Spain; [Coelho, Eduardo A.

The objective of this study is to investigate the hypothesis that some specific comorbidities increase the likelihood of a DF case progressing to DHF. Methods A concurrent case-control study, conducted during dengue epidemics, from 2009 to 2012. Cases were patients with dengue fever that progressed to DHF, and controls were patients of dengue fever who did not progress to DHF. Logistic regression was used to estimate the association between DHF and comorbidities. Results There were 490 cases of DHF and 1,316 controls. Among adults, progression to DHF was associated with self-reported hypertension (OR = 1.6; 95% CI 1.1-2.1) and skin allergy (OR = 1.8; 95% CI 1.1-3.2) with DHF after adjusting for ethnicity and socio-economic variables. There was no statistically significant association between any chronic disease and progression to DHF in those younger than 15 years. Conclusions Physicians attending patients with dengue fever should keep those with hypertension or skin allergies in health units to monitor progression for early intervention. This would reduce mortality by dengue.","[Teixeira, Maria Gloria; Paixao, Enny S.; Costa, Maria da Conceicao N.; Dias, Juarez P.; Figueiredo, Maria Aparecida A.; Morato, Vanessa; Barreto, Mauricio L.] Inst Saude Coletiva, Salvador, BA, Brazil; [Cunha, Rivaldo V.] Univ Fed Mato Grosso do Sul, Fac Med, Cidade Univ, Campo Grande, MS, Brazil; [Pamplona, Luciano] Univ Fed Ceara, Inst Ciencias Saude, Salvador, BA, Brazil; [Figueiredo, Camila A.] Univ Fed Bahia, Inst Ciencia Vida, Salvador, BA, Brazil; [Blanton, Ronald] Case Western Reserve Univ, Cleveland, OH 44106 USA; [Barreto, Mauricio L.] Fiocruz MS, Ctr Pesquisas Goncalo Muniz, Salvador, BA, Brazil; [Rodrigues, Laura C.] London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, London WC1, England","Teixeira, MG (reprint author), Inst Saude Coletiva, Salvador, BA, Brazil.",magloria@ufba.br,"Figueiredo, Camila/H-3525-2015; Barreto, Mauricio L/B-1752-2008; Teixeira, Maria Gloria/G-4808-2012","Figueiredo, Camila/0000-0003-1356-6188; Barreto, Mauricio L/0000-0002-0215-4930; Teixeira, Maria Gloria/0000-0003-3318-3408; Rodrigues, Laura Cunha/0000-0001-9008-660X",National Counsel of Technological and Scientific Development (CNPq) [Process 576060/2008-9],"This work was supported by National Counsel of Technological and Scientific Development (CNPq).

In late 2013, CHIKV emerged on Saint-Martin Island in the Caribbean and spread throughout the region reaching more than 40 countries. Thus far, Ae. aegypti mosquitoes have been implicated as the sole vector in the outbreaks, leading to the hypothesis that CHIKV spread could be limited only to regions where this mosquito species is dominant. Methodology/Principal Findings We determined the ability of local populations of Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus from the Americas and Europe to transmit the CHIKV strain of the Asian genotype isolated from Saint-Martin Island (CHIKV_SM) during the recent epidemic, and an East-Central-South African (ECSA) genotype CHIKV strain isolated from La Reunion Island (CHIKV_LR) as a well-characterized control virus. We also evaluated the effect of temperature on transmission of CHIKV_SM by European Ae. albopictus. We found that (i) Aedes aegypti from Saint-Martin Island transmit CHIKV_SM and CHIKV_LR with similar efficiency, (ii) Ae. aegypti from the Americas display similar transmission efficiency for CHIKV_SM, (iii) American and European populations of the alternative vector species Ae. albopictus were as competent as Ae. aegypti populations with respect to transmission of CHIKV_SM and (iv) exposure of European Ae. albopictus to low temperatures (20 degrees C) significantly reduced the transmission potential for CHIKV_SM. Conclusions/Significance CHIKV strains belonging to the ECSA genotype could also have initiated local transmission in the new world. Additionally, the ongoing CHIKV outbreak in the Americas could potentially spread throughout Ae. aegypti-and Ae. albopictus-infested regions of the Americas with possible imported cases of CHIKV to Ae. albopictus-infested regions in Europe. Colder temperatures may decrease the local transmission of CHIKV_SM by European Ae. albopictus, potentially explaining the lack of autochthonous transmission of CHIKV_SM in Europe despite the hundreds of imported CHIKV cases returning from the Caribbean.","[Vega-Rua, Anubis; Mousson, Laurence; Vazeille, Marie; Fuchs, Sappho; Failloux, Anna-Bella] Inst Pasteur, Dept Virol Arboviruses & Insect Vectors, Paris, France; [Vega-Rua, Anubis] Univ Paris 06, Sorbonne Univ, IFD, Paris, France; [Lourenco-de-Oliveira, Ricardo] Fiocruz MS, Inst Oswaldo Cruz, Lab Transmissores Hematozorios, BR-21045900 Rio De Janeiro, Brazil; [Yebakima, Andre] Ctr Demousticat Conseil Gen La Martinique, Fort De France, Martinique, France; [Gustave, Joel] Agence Reg Dante ARS Guadeloupe St Martin & St Ba, Pole Sante Publ, Gourbeyre, Guadeloupe, France; [Girod, Romain; Dusfour, Isabelle] Inst Pasteur Guyane, Unit Entomol Med, Cayenne, French Guiana, France; [Leparc-Goffart, Isabelle] Armees Hop Instruct Armees Laveran, Inst Rech Biomed, Ctr Natl Reference CNR Arbovirus, Marseille, France; [Vanlandingham, Dana L.] Kansas State Univ, Coll Vet Med, Dept Diagnost Med & Pathobiol, Manhattan, KS 66506 USA; [Vanlandingham, Dana L.; Huang, Yan-Jang S.] Kansas State Univ, Biosecur Res Inst, Manhattan, KS 66506 USA; [Lounibos, L.

A long history of indoor spraying with residual insecticides, combined recently with distribution of long lasting insecticidal nets and artemether-lumefantrine therapy, has been implemented in Solomon Islands. The impact of these interventions on local endemicity of Plasmodium spp. is unknown. Methods In 2012, a cross-sectional survey of 3501 residents of all ages was conducted in Ngella, Central Islands Province, Solomon Islands. Prevalence of Plasmodium falciparum, P. vivax, P. ovale and P. malariae was assessed by quantitative PCR (qPCR) and light microscopy (LM). Presence of gametocytes was determined by reverse transcription quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR). Results By qPCR, 468 Plasmodium spp. infections were detected (prevalence = 13.4%; 463 P. vivax, five mixed P. falciparum/P. vivax, no P. ovale or P. malariae) versus 130 by LM (prevalence = 3.7%; 126 P. vivax, three P. falciparum and one P. falciparum/P. vivax). The prevalence of P. vivax infection varied significantly among villages (range 3.0-38.5%, p<0.001) and across age groups (5.3-25.9%, p<0.001). Of 468 P. vivax infections, 72.9% were sub-microscopic, 84.5% afebrile and 60.0% were both sub-microscopic and afebrile. Local residency, low education level of the household head and living in a household with at least one other P. vivax infected individual increased the risk of P. vivax infection. Overall, 23.5% of P. vivax infections had concurrent gametocytaemia. Of all P. vivax positive samples, 29.2% were polyclonal by MS16 and msp1F3 genotyping. All five P. falciparum infections were detected in residents of the same village, carried the same msp2 allele and four were positive for P. falciparum gametocytes. Conclusion P. vivax infection remains endemic in Ngella, with the majority of cases afebrile and below the detection limit of LM. P. falciparum has nearly disappeared, but the risk of re-introductions and outbreaks due to travel to nearby islands with higher malaria endemicity remains.","[Waltmann, Andreea; Koepfli, Cristian; Barry, Alyssa E.; Mueller, Ivo] Walter & Eliza Hall Inst Med Res, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Waltmann, Andreea; Koepfli, Cristian; Barry, Alyssa E.; Mueller, Ivo] Univ Melbourne, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Darcy, Andrew W.; Vahi, Ventis; Piziki, David] Minist Hlth, Natl Hlth Training & Res Inst, Honiara, Solomon Islands; [Harris, Ivor; Shanks, G.

We sought to characterize the proportion of subclinical and symptomatic CHIKV infections in a prospective cohort study in a country with known CHIKV circulation. Methods/Findings A prospective longitudinal cohort of subjects >= 6 months old underwent community-based active surveillance for acute febrile illness in Cebu City, Philippines from 2012-13. Subjects with fever history were clinically evaluated at acute, 2, 5, and 8 day visits, and at a 3-week convalescent visit. Blood was collected at the acute and 3-week convalescent visits. Symptomatic CHIKV infections were identified by positive CHIKV PCR in acute blood samples and/or CHIKV IgM/IgG ELISA seroconversion in paired acute/convalescent samples. Enrollment and 12-month blood samples underwent plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT) using CHIKV attenuated strain 181/clone25. Subclinical CHIKV infections were identified by >= 8-fold rise from a baseline enrollment PRNT titer < 10 without symptomatic infection detected during the intervening surveillance period. Selected CHIKV PCR-positive samples underwent viral isolation and envelope protein-1 gene sequencing. Of 853 subjects who completed all study procedures at 12 months, 19 symptomatic infections (2.19 per 100 person-years) and 87 subclinical infections (10.03 per 100 person-years) occurred. The ratio of subclinical-to-symptomatic infections was 4.6:1 varying with age from 2: 1 in 6 month-5 year olds to 12: 1 in those >50 years old. Baseline CHIKV PRNT titer >= 10 was associated with 100% (95% CI: 46.1, 100.0) protection from symptomatic CHIKV infection. Phylogenetic analysis demonstrated Asian genotype closely related to strains from Asia and the Caribbean. Conclusions Subclinical infections accounted for a majority of total CHIKV infections. A positive baseline CHIKV PRNT titer was associated with protection from symptomatic CHIKV infection. These findings have implications for assessing disease burden, understanding virus transmission, and supporting vaccine development.","[Yoon, In-Kyu; Fernandez, Stefan; Thaisomboonsuk, Butsaya; Klungthong, Chonticha; Levy, Jens W.; Macareo, Louis R.; Hermann, Laura L.; Nisalak, Ananda] Armed Forces Res Inst Med Sci, Dept Virol, Bangkok 10400, Thailand; [Alera, Maria Theresa; Lago, Catherine B.; Velasco, John Mark] Philippines AFRIMS Virol Res Unit, Cebu, Philippines; [Tac-An, Ilya A.; Villa, Daisy] Cebu City Hlth Dept, Cebu, Philippines; [Roque, Vito G., Jr.] Natl Epidemiol Ctr, Dept Hlth, Manila, Philippines; [Salje, Henrik] Johns Hopkins Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Epidemiol, Baltimore, MD USA; [Hermann, Laura L.] Univ Toronto, Dept Med, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Srikiatkhachorn, Anon] Univ Massachusetts, Sch Med, Dept Med, Div Infect Dis & Immunol, Worcester, MA USA","Yoon, IK (reprint author), Armed Forces Res Inst Med Sci, Dept Virol, Bangkok 10400, Thailand.",Yooni@afrims.org,,"Salje, Henrik/0000-0003-3626-4254",Armed Forces Health Surveillance Center-Global Emerging Infections Surveillance and Response System [P0140 14 AF]; Canadian Institutes of Health Research,"This research was funded by a grant from the Armed Forces Health Surveillance Center-Global Emerging Infections Surveillance and Response System (Grant #P0140 14 AF) and a Canadian Institutes of Health Research Fellowship for LH.

With vaccines or effective drugs still unavailable for most such pathogens, disease prevention heavily relies on vector control. To date, however, mosquito control has proven difficult, with low breeding-site coverage during control campaigns identified as a major drawback. A novel tactic exploits the egg-laying behavior of mosquitoes to have them disseminate tiny particles of a potent larvicide, pyriproxyfen (PPF), from resting to breeding sites, thus improving coverage. This approach has yielded promising results at small spatial scales, but its wider applicability remains unclear. Methodology/Principal Findings We conducted a four-month trial within a 20-month study to investigate mosquito-driven dissemination of PPF dust-particles from 100 'dissemination stations' (DSs) deployed in a 7-ha sub-area to surveillance dwellings and sentinel breeding sites (SBSs) distributed over an urban neighborhood of about 50 ha. We assessed the impact of the trial by measuring juvenile mosquito mortality and adult mosquito emergence in each SBS-month. Using data from 1,075 dwelling-months, 2,988 SBS-months, and 29,922 individual mosquitoes, we show that mosquito-disseminated PPF yielded high coverage of dwellings (up to 100%) and SBSs (up to 94.3%). Juvenile mosquito mortality in SBSs (about 4% at baseline) increased by over one order of magnitude during PPF dissemination (about 75%). This led to a > 10-fold decrease of adult mosquito emergence from SBSs, from approximately 1,000-3,000 adults/month before to about 100 adults/month during PPF dissemination. Conclusions/Significance By expanding breeding-site coverage and boosting juvenile mosquito mortality, a strategy based on mosquito-disseminated PPF has potential to substantially enhance mosquito control. Sharp declines in adult mosquito emergence can lower vector/host ratios, reducing the risk of disease outbreaks. This approach is a very promising complement to current and novel mosquito control strategies; it will probably be especially relevant for the control of urban disease vectors, such as Aedes and Culex species, that often cause large epidemics.","[Abad-Franch, Fernando; Zamora-Perea, Elvira; Padilla-Torres, Samael D.; Luz, Sergio L.

In this context, community-based responses have proven vital for containing Ebola virus disease (EVD) and shifting the epidemic curve. Despite a surge in interest in local innovations that effectively contained the epidemic, the mechanisms for community-based response remain unclear. This study provides baseline information on community-based epidemic control priorities and identifies innovative local strategies for containing EVD in Liberia. Methodology/Principal Findings This study was conducted in September 2014 in 15 communities in Monrovia and Montserrado County, Liberia - one of the epicenters of the Ebola outbreak. Findings from 15 focus group discussions with 386 community leaders identified strategies being undertaken and recommendations for what a community-based response to Ebola should look like under then-existing conditions. Data were collected on the following topics: prevention, surveillance, care-giving, community-based treatment and support, networks and hotlines, response teams, Ebola treatment units (ETUs) and hospitals, the management of corpses, quarantine and isolation, orphans, memorialization, and the need for community-based training and education. Findings have been presented as community-based strategies and recommendations for (1) prevention, (2) treatment and response, and (3) community sequelae and recovery. Several models for community-based management of the current Ebola outbreak were proposed. Additional findings indicate positive attitudes towards early Ebola survivors, and the need for community-based psychosocial support. Conclusions/Significance Local communities' strategies and recommendations give insight into how urban Liberian communities contained the EVD outbreak while navigating the systemic failures of the initial state and international response. Communities in urban Liberia adapted to the epidemic using multiple coping strategies. In the absence of health, infrastructural and material supports, local people engaged in self-reliance in order to contain the epidemic at the micro-social level. These innovations were regarded as necessary, but as less desirable than a well-supported health-systems based response; and were seen as involving considerable individual, social, and public health costs, including heightened vulnerability to infection.","[Abramowitz, Sharon Alane] Univ Florida, Dept Anthropol, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; [Abramowitz, Sharon Alane] Univ Florida, Ctr African Studies, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; [McLean, Kristen E.] Yale Univ, Dept Anthropol, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; [McKune, Sarah Lindley] Univ Florida, Dept Epidemiol, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; [McKune, Sarah Lindley] Univ Florida, Coll Publ Hlth & Hlth Profess, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; [Bardosh, Kevin Louis] Univ Edinburgh, Ctr Infect Dis, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland; [Bardosh, Kevin Louis] Emerging Pathogens Inst, Gainesville, FL USA; [Fallah, Mosoka; Monger, Josephine; Tehoungue, Kodjo] ACF, Ebola Emergency Response Program, Monrovia, Liberia; [Omidian, Patricia A.] Focusing Int, Chestnut Ridge, NY USA","Abramowitz, SA (reprint author), Univ Florida, Dept Anthropol, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA.",kristen.mclean@yale.edu,"Abramowitz, Sharon/F-4368-2016","Abramowitz, Sharon/0000-0003-3671-8842",World Health Organization,"The World Health Organization funded data collection and preliminary analysis for the purpose of program evaluation: www.who.int.

The tsetse vector is extensively distributed across sub-Saharan Africa. Trypanosomiasis maintenance is determined by the interrelationship of three elements: vertebrate host, parasite and the vector responsible for transmission. Mapping the distribution and abundance of tsetse flies assists in predicting trypanosomiasis distributions and developing rational strategies for disease and vector control. Given scarce resources to carry out regular full scale field tsetse surveys to up-date existing tsetse maps, there is a need to devise inexpensive means for regularly obtaining dependable area-wide tsetse data to guide control activities. In this study we used spatial epidemiological modelling techniques (logistic regression) involving 5000 field-based tsetse-data (G.f.fuscipes) points over an area of 40,000 km(2), with satellite-derived environmental surrogates composed of precipitation, temperature, land cover, normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI) and elevation at the sub-national level. We used these extensive tsetse data to analyse the relationships between presence of tsetse (G.f.fuscipes) and environmental variables. The strength of the results was enhanced through the application of a spatial autologistic regression model (SARM). Using the SARM we showed that the probability of tsetse presence increased with proportion of forest cover and riverine vegetation. The key outputs are a predictive tsetse distribution map for the Lake Victoria basin of Uganda and an improved understanding of the association between tsetse presence and environmental variables. The predicted spatial distribution of tsetse in the Lake Victoria basin of Uganda will provide significant new information to assist with the spatial targeting of tsetse and trypanosomiasis control.","[Albert, Mugenyi] Coordinating Off Control Trypanosomiasis Uganda, Kampala, Uganda; [Albert, Mugenyi; Welburn, Susan C.] Univ Edinburgh, Div Infect & Pathway Med, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland; [Albert, Mugenyi; Welburn, Susan C.] Univ Edinburgh, Ctr Infect Dis, Sch Biomed Sci, Coll Med & Vet Med, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland; [Wardrop, Nicola A.; Atkinson, Peter M.] Univ Southampton, Geog & Environm, Southampton, Hants, England; [Atkinson, Peter M.] Univ Utrecht, Dept Phys Geog, Fac Geosci, Utrecht, Netherlands; [Torr, Steve J.] Univ Liverpool, Liverpool Sch Trop Med, Liverpool L3 5QA, Merseyside, England; [Torr, Steve J.] Univ Warwick, Warwick Med Sch, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England","Albert, M (reprint author), Coordinating Off Control Trypanosomiasis Uganda, Kampala, Uganda.",S0977855@staffmail.ed.ac.uk,"Torr, Stephen/N-7161-2016","Torr, Stephen/0000-0001-9550-4030; Wardrop, Nicola/0000-0001-7401-4841",European Union [221948]; Medical Research Council [MR/J012343/1],"The research leading to these results has received funding from the European Union's Seventh Framework Program (FP7/2007-2013) under grant agreement no 221948, ICONZ (Integrated Control of Neglected Zoonoses).

Synergistic associations between malnutrition and malaria morbidity and mortality have been suggested, as well as undernutrition being protective against infection, while other studies found no association. We sought to evaluate the relationship between the number of malaria episodes and nutritional statuses in a cohort of children below 15 years of age living in a rural community in the Brazilian Amazon. Methodology/Principal Findings Following a baseline survey of clinical, malaria and nutritional assessment including anthropometry measurements and hemoglobin concentration, 202 children ranging from 1 month to 14 years of age were followed for one year through passive case detection for malaria episodes. After follow-up, all children were assessed again in order to detect changes in nutritional indicators associated with malaria infection. We also examined the risk of presenting malaria episodes during follow-up according to presence of stunting at baseline. Children who suffered malaria episodes during follow-up presented worse anthropometric parameters values during this period. The main change was a reduction of the linear growth velocity, associated with both the number of episodes and how close the last or only malaria episode and the second anthropometric assessment were. Changes were also observed for indices associated with chronic changes, such as weight-for-age and BMI-for-age, which conversely, were more frequently observed in children with the last or only episode occurring between 6 and 12 months preceding the second nutritional assessment survey. Children with inadequate height-for-age at baseline (Z-score < -2) presented lower risk of suffering malaria episodes during follow-up as assessed by both the log-rank test (p = 0.057) and the multivariable Cox-proportional hazards regression (Hazard Ratio = 0.31, 95% CI [0.10; 0.99] p=0.049). Conclusions Malaria was associated with impaired nutritional status amongst children in an endemic area of the Western Brazilian Amazon where P. vivax predominates. Our data all supports that the association presents differential effects for each age group, suggesting distinct pathophysiology pathways. We were also able to demonstrate that undernourishment at baseline was protective to malaria during follow-up. These findings support an intriguing interaction between these conditions in the rural Amazon and the need for a more integrative approach by health systems in endemic areas.","[Araujo Alexandre, Marcia Almeida; Siqueira, Andre Machado; Vitor-Silva, Sheila; Melo, Gisely Cardoso; Monteiro, Wuelton Marcelo; Guimaraes Lacerda, Marcus Vinicius; Costa Alecrim, Maria das Gracas] Fundacao Med Trop Doutor Heitor Vieira Dourado, Gerencia Malaria, Manaus, Amazonas, Brazil; [Araujo Alexandre, Marcia Almeida; Benzecry, Silvana Gomes; Siqueira, Andre Machado; Melo, Gisely Cardoso; Monteiro, Wuelton Marcelo; Guimaraes Lacerda, Marcus Vinicius; Costa Alecrim, Maria das Gracas] Univ Estado Amazonas, Programa Posgrad Med Trop, Manaus, Amazonas, Brazil; [Benzecry, Silvana Gomes; Leite, Heitor Pons] Univ Fed Sao Paulo, Dept Pediat, Discipline Nutr & Metab, Sao Paulo, Brazil; [Siqueira, Andre Machado] Fundacao Oswaldo Cruz, Lab Pesquisa Clin Doencas Febris Agudas, Inst Nacl Infectol Evandro Chagas, Rio De Janeiro, Brazil; [Guimaraes Lacerda, Marcus Vinicius] Fundacao Oswaldo Cruz, Ctr Pesquisas Leonidas & Maria Deane, Manaus, Amazonas, Brazil","Alexandre, MAA (reprint author), Fundacao Med Trop Doutor Heitor Vieira Dourado, Gerencia Malaria, Manaus, Amazonas, Brazil.",marcuslacerda.br@gmail.com,"Leite, Heitor Pons/F-9178-2013; Siqueira, Andre M/G-1340-2010","Leite, Heitor Pons/0000-0001-8260-7559; Siqueira, Andre M/0000-0003-2208-0294","CNPq; FAPEAM; Fundacio Cellex [483758/2009-4, G64334048/2007]","This study was funded by CNPq, FAPEAM and Fundacio Cellex (grant 483758/2009-4; G64334048/2007).

This skin disease is the third most common mycobacterial disease and its rapid diagnosis and treatment are necessary. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is considered to be the most sensitive method for the laboratory confirmation of Buruli ulcer. However, PCR remains expensive and involves reagents unsuitable for use in tropical countries with poor storage conditions, hindering the development of reliable quantitative PCR (qPCR) diagnosis. We aimed to overcome this problem by developing a ready-to-use dry qPCR mix for the diagnosis of M. ulcerans infection. Methodology/Principal Findings We compared the efficiency of three different dry qPCR mixes, lyophilized with various concentrations of cryoprotectants, with that of a freshly prepared mixture, for the detection of a standard range of M. ulcerans DNA concentrations. We evaluated the heat resistance of the dry mixes, comparing them with the fresh mix after heating. We also evaluated one of the dry mixes in field conditions, by analyzing 93 specimens from patients with suspected Buruli ulcers. The dry mix was (i) highly resistant to heat; (ii) of similar sensitivity and efficiency to the fresh mix and (iii) easier to use than the fresh mix. Conclusions Dry qPCR mixes are suitable for use in the diagnosis of M. ulcerans infection in endemic countries. The user-friendly format of this mix makes it possible for untrained staff to perform diagnostic tests with a limited risk of contamination. The possibility of using this mix in either vial or strip form provides considerable flexibility for the management of small or large amounts of sample. Thus, dry-mix qPCR could be used as a reliable tool for the diagnosis of Buruli ulcer in the field.","[Babonneau, Jeremie; Marsollier, Laurent] CHU Angers, Inserm Avenir Team, CRCNA, Inserm U892,CNRS 6299,ATOMycA, Angers, France; [Babonneau, Jeremie; Marsollier, Laurent] CHU Angers, LUNAM, Angers, France; [Babonneau, Jeremie; Marsollier, Laurent] Univ Angers, Angers, France; [Bernard, Christian; Robert, Raymond] SR2B, Avrille, France; [Marion, Estelle; Chauty, Annick] Ctr Diagnost & Traitement Ulcere Buruli, Pobe, Benin; [Kempf, Marie] CHU Angers, Inst Biol Sante PBH, Lab Bacteriol, Angers, France","Babonneau, J (reprint author), CHU Angers, Inserm Avenir Team, CRCNA, Inserm U892,CNRS 6299,ATOMycA, Angers, France.",jeremie_babonneau@hotmail.fr,"Marion, Estelle/G-3437-2016; Marsollier, Laurent/P-6178-2015","Marion, Estelle/0000-0003-4917-9665; Vincent, Quentin/0000-0001-6030-5912",INSERM-Avenir; Raoul Follereau Foundation; Region Pays de la Loire (ARMINA project); University Hospital of Angers; university of Angers,"Financial support for this work was provided by INSERM-Avenir, the Raoul Follereau Foundation and the Region Pays de la Loire (ARMINA project) and University Hospital of Angers and university of Angers.

Japanese immigrants and their descendants have a high risk of acquiring this infection due to intense population exchange between Brazil and Japan. Objective This cross-sectional study aimed to estimate the prevalence of HTLV, analyze the main risk factors associated with this infection, identify the main circulating types and subtypes of HTLV in Japanese immigrants and descendants living in Campo Grande-MS (Middle-West Brazil), as well as analyze the phylogenetic relationship among isolates of HTLV. Study Design A total of 219 individuals were interviewed and submitted to blood collection. All collected blood samples were submitted for detection of anti-HTLV-1/2 using the immunoassay ELISA and confirmed by immunoblot method. The proviral DNA of the 14 samples HTLV-1 positive were genotyped by nucleotide sequencing. Results The overall prevalence of HTLV-1 was 6.8% (IC 95%: 3,5-10,2). Descriptive analysis of behavioral risk factors showed statistical association between HTLV-1 and age greater than or equal to 45 years. The proviral DNA of HTLV-1 was detected in all HTLV-1 positive samples. Of these, 14 were sequenced and classified as Cosmopolitan subtype, and 50% (7/14) belonged to subgroup A (transcontinental) and 50% (7/14) to the subgroup B (Japanese). Conclusion The high prevalence of HTLV-1 found evidence of the importance of early diagnosis and counseling of individuals infected with HTLV-1 for the control and prevention of the spread of this infection among Japanese immigrants and their descendants in Central Brazil.","[Bandeira, Larissa M.; Uehara, Silvia N.

Fecal samples cannot be preserved, and hence, should be processed on the day of collection and examined under a microscope within 60 min of slide preparation. Mini-FLOTAC is a technique that allows examining fixed fecal samples. We assessed the performance of Mini-FLOTAC using formalin-fixed stool samples compared to Kato-Katz and determined the dynamics of prevalence and intensity estimates of soil-transmitted helminth infection over a 31-day time period. Methodology The study was carried out in late 2013 on Pemba Island, Tanzania. Forty-one children were enrolled and stool samples were subjected on the day of collection to a single Kato-Katz thick smear and Mini-FLOTAC examination; 12 aliquots of stool were fixed in 5% formalin and subsequently examined by Mini-FLOTAC up to 31 days after collection. Principal Findings The combined results from Kato-Katz and Mini-FLOTAC revealed that 100% of children were positive for Trichuris trichiura, 85% for Ascaris lumbricoides, and 54% for hookworm. Kato-Katz and Mini-FLOTAC techniques found similar prevalence estimates for A. lumbricoides (85% versus 76%), T. trichiura (98% versus 100%), and hookworm (42% versus 51%). The mean eggs per gram of stool (EPG) according to Kato-Katz and Mini-FLOTAC was 12,075 and 11,679 for A. lumbricoides, 1,074 and 1,592 for T. trichiura, and 255 and 220 for hookworm, respectively. The mean EPG from day 1 to 31 of fixation was stable for A. lumbricoides and T. trichiura, but gradually declined for hookworm, starting at day 15. Conclusions/Significance The findings of our study suggest that for a qualitative diagnosis of soil-transmitted helminth infection, stool samples can be fixed in 5% formalin for at least 30 days. However, for an accurate quantitative diagnosis of hookworm, we suggest a limit of 15 days of preservation. Our results have direct implication for integrating soil-transmitted helminthiasis into transmission assessment surveys for lymphatic filariasis.","[Barda, Beatrice; Keiser, Jennifer; Speich, Benjamin] Swiss Trop & Publ Hlth Inst, Dept Med Parasitol & Infect Biol, Basel, Switzerland; [Barda, Beatrice; Keiser, Jennifer; Speich, Benjamin; Utzinger, Juerg] Univ Basel, Basel, Switzerland; [Albonico, Marco] Ivo de Carneri Fdn, Milan, Italy; [Ianniello, Davide; Rinaldi, Laura; Cringoli, Giuseppe] Univ Naples Federico II, Sect Vet Parasitol & Parasit Dis, Naples, Italy; [Ame, Shaali M.] Publ Hlth Lab Ivo de Carneri, Lab Div, Chake Chake, Tanzania; [Burioni, Roberto] Hosp San Raffaele, Lab Microbiol & Virol, I-20132 Milan, Italy; [Montresor, Antonio] WHO, Dept Control Neglected Trop Dis, CH-1211 Geneva, Switzerland; [Utzinger, Juerg] Swiss Trop & Publ Hlth Inst, Dept Epidemiol & Publ Hlth, Basel, Switzerland","Barda, B (reprint author), Swiss Trop & Publ Hlth Inst, Dept Med Parasitol & Infect Biol, Basel, Switzerland.",beatrice.barda@unibas.ch,"Montresor, Antonio/J-3137-2019","Speich, Benjamin/0000-0002-3301-8085; ALBONICO, Marco/0000-0002-7805-2391",WHO; Swiss Tropical and Public Health Institute; Department of Veterinary Parasitology and Parasitic Diseases of Naples,"WHO founded the field work, together with the Swiss Tropical and Public Health Institute and the Department of Veterinary Parasitology and Parasitic Diseases of Naples.

These strains are unusual, because their genomic characterisation shows that they belong to the B. cereus species, although they harbour two plasmids, pBCXO1 and pBCXO2, that are highly similar to the pXO1 and pXO2 plasmids of B. anthracis that encode the toxins and the polyglutamate capsule respectively. The virulence factors implicated in the pathogenicity of these B. cereus bv anthracis strains remain to be characterised. We tested their virulence by cutaneous and intranasal delivery in mice and guinea pigs; they were as virulent as wild-type B. anthracis. Unlike as described for pXO2-cured B. anthracis, the CA strain cured of the pBCXO2 plasmid was still highly virulent, showing the existence of other virulence factors. Indeed, these strains concomitantly expressed a hyaluronic acid (HA) capsule and the B. anthracis polyglutamate (PDGA) capsule. The HA capsule was encoded by the hasACB operon on pBCXO1, and its expression was regulated by the global transcription regulator AtxA, which controls anthrax toxins and PDGA capsule in B. anthracis. Thus, the HA and PDGA capsules and toxins were co-regulated by AtxA. We explored the respective effect of the virulence factors on colonisation and dissemination of CA within its host by constructing bioluminescent mutants. Expression of the HA capsule by itself led to local multiplication and, during intranasal infection, to local dissemination to the adjacent brain tissue. Co-expression of either toxins or PDGA capsule with HA capsule enabled systemic dissemination, thus providing a clear evolutionary advantage. Protection against infection by B. cereus bv anthracis required the same vaccination formulation as that used against B. anthracis. Thus, these strains, at the frontier between B. anthracis and B. cereus, provide insight into how the monomorphic B. anthracis may have emerged.","[Brezillon, Christophe; Haustant, Michel; Corre, Jean-Philippe; Couture-Tosi, Evelyne; Mock, Michele E.; Goossens, Pierre L.] Inst Pasteur, Pathogenie Toxiinfect Bacteriennes, Paris, France; [Dupke, Susann; Lander, Angelika; Franz, Tatjana; Grunow, Roland; Klee, Silke R.] Robert Koch Inst, Ctr Biol Threats & Special Pathogens ZBS 2, Berlin, Germany; [Monot, Marc] Inst Pasteur, Pathogenese Bactrries Anaerobies, Paris, France; [Jouvion, Gregory] Inst Pasteur, Unite Histopathol Humaine & Modeles Anim, Paris, France; [Leendertz, Fabian H.] Robert Koch Inst, Epidemiol Highly Pathogen Microorganisms P 3, Berlin, Germany","Brezillon, C (reprint author), Inst Pasteur, Pathogenie Toxiinfect Bacteriennes, Paris, France.",KleeS@rki.de; pierre.goossens@pasteur.fr,"Leendertz, Fabian Hubertus/H-8902-2019; Monot, Marc/F-3058-2015","Monot, Marc/0000-0003-0738-7335",Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) [KL 2521/1-1]; InVS,"This work was partly supported by the ""Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft"" (DFG) grant KL 2521/1-1 (RKI) and the InVS (IP).

Wolbachia can invade and spread to infect all individuals within wild mosquito populations, but requires a high rate of maternal transmission, strong cytoplasmic incompatibility and low fitness costs in the host in order to do so. Additionally, extensive differences in climate, field-release protocols, urbanization level and human density amongst the sites where this bacterium has been deployed have limited comparison and analysis of Wolbachia's invasive potential. Methodology/Principal Findings We examined key phenotypic effects of the wMel Wolbachia strain in laboratory Aedes aegypti mosquitoes with a Brazilian genetic background to characterize its invasive potential. We show that the wMel strain causes strong cytoplasmic incompatibility, a high rate of maternal transmission and has no evident detrimental effect on host fecundity or fertility. Next, to understand the effects of different urban landscapes on the likelihood of mosquito survival, we performed mark-release-recapture experiments using Wolbachia-uninfected Brazilian mosquitoes in two areas of Rio de Janeiro where Wolbachia will be deployed in the future. We characterized the mosquito populations in relation to the socio-demographic conditions at these sites, and at three other future release areas. We then constructed mathematical models using both the laboratory and field data, and used these to describe the influence of urban environmental conditions on the likelihood that the Wolbachia infection frequency could reach 100% following mosquito release. We predict successful invasion at all five field sites, however the conditions by which this occurs vary greatly between sites, and are strongly influenced by the size of the local mosquito population. Conclusions/Significance Through analysis of laboratory, field and mathematical data, we show that the wMel strain of Wolbachia possesses the characteristics required to spread effectively in different urban socio-demographic environments in Rio de Janeiro, including those where mosquito releases from the Eliminate Dengue Program will take place.","[Carneiro Dutra, Heverton Leandro; Caragata, Eric Pearce; Lopes Silva, Jessica Barreto; Moreira, Luciano Andrade] Ctr Pesquisas Rene Rachou Fiocruz, Mosquitos Vetores Endossimbiontes & Interacao Pat, Belo Horizonte, MG, Brazil; [Barbosa dos Santos, Lilha Maria; Maciel-de-Freitas, Rafael] Fiocruz MS, Inst Oswaldo Cruz, Lab Transmissores Hematozoarios, BR-21045900 Rio De Janeiro, RJ, Brazil; [Maciel Villela, Daniel Antunes] Fiocruz MS, Inst Oswaldo Cruz, Programa Comp Cient, BR-21045900 Rio De Janeiro, RJ, Brazil","Dutra, HLC (reprint author), Ctr Pesquisas Rene Rachou Fiocruz, Mosquitos Vetores Endossimbiontes & Interacao Pat, Belo Horizonte, MG, Brazil.",luciano@cpqrr.fiocruz.br,"Dutra, Heverton Leandro Carneiro/V-7517-2019","Dutra, Heverton Leandro Carneiro/0000-0002-0917-4512; Villela, Daniel/0000-0001-8371-2959; Maciel-de-Freitas, Rafael/0000-0002-2198-6492",FAPEMIG; CNPq; INCT-EM; Brazilian Ministry of Health (DECIT/SVS); Foundations for the National Institutes of Health through the Vector-Based Transmission of Control: Discovery Research (VCTR) program of the Grand Challenges in Global Health Initiatives of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundations,"This work was supported by FAPEMIG, CNPq, INCT-EM, the Brazilian Ministry of Health (DECIT/SVS), and a grant to Monash University from the Foundations for the National Institutes of Health through the Vector-Based Transmission of Control: Discovery Research (VCTR) program of the Grand Challenges in Global Health Initiatives of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundations.

We identified adenosine (ADO) and adenosine monophosphate (AMP) as active pharmacologic compounds present in Phlebotomus papatasi saliva that inhibit dendritic cell (DC) functions through a PGE(2)/IL 10-dependent mechanism. Methodology/Principal Findings Herein, we prepared a mixture of ADO and AMP in equimolar amounts similar to those present in the salivary-gland extract (SGE) form one pair of salivary glands of P. papatasi and co-injected it with Leishmania amazonensis or L. major into mouse ears. ADO+ AMP mimicked exacerbative effects of P. papatasi saliva in leishmaniasis, increasing parasite burden and cutaneous lesions. Enzymatic catabolism of salivary nucleosides reversed the SGE-induced immunosuppressive effect associated with IL-10 enhancement. Immunosuppressive factors COX2 and IL-10 were upregulated and failed to enhance ear lesion and parasite burden in IL 10(-/-) infected mice. Furthermore, nucleosides increased regulatory T cell (Treg) marker expression on CD4(+)CD25(-) cells, suggesting induction of Tregs on effector T cells (T eff). Treg induction (iTreg) was associated with nucleoside-induced tolerogenic dendritic cells (tDCs) expressing higher levels of COX2 and IL-10. In vitro generation of Tregs was more efficient in DCs treated with nucleosides. Suppressive effects of nucleosides during cutaneous leishmaniasis were mediated through an A2(A)R-dependent mechanism. Using BALB/c mice deficient in A2A ADO receptor (A2(A)R(-/-)), we showed that co-inoculated mice controlled infection, displaying lower parasite numbers at infection sites and reduced iTreg generation. Conclusion/Significance We have demonstrated that ADO and AMP in P. papatasi saliva mediate exacerbative effects of Leishmania infection by acting preferentially on DCs promoting a tolerogenic profile in DCs and by generating iTregs in inflammatory foci through an A2(A)R mechanism.","[Carregaro, Vanessa; Souza-Junior, Djalma L.; Costa, Diego L.; Sacramento, Lais A.; Nascimento, Manuela S.

S100A8 (MRP8) and S100A9 (MRP14) form bioactive antimicrobial heterodimers (calprotectin) that can activate Toll-like receptor 4, promoting lethal, endotoxin-induced shock and multi-organ failure. We aimed to characterize the expression and function of S100A8/A9 in patients with typhoid fever and in a murine invasive Salmonella model. Methods and principal findings S100A8/A9 protein levels were determined in acute phase plasma or feces from 28 Bangladeshi patients, and convalescent phase plasma from 60 Indonesian patients with blood culture or PCR-confirmed typhoid fever, and compared to 98 healthy control subjects. To functionally characterize the role of S100A8/A9, we challenged wildtype (WT) and S100A9(-/-) mice with S. Typhimurium and determined bacterial loads and inflammation 2- and 5-days post infection. We further assessed the antimicrobial function of recombinant S100A8/A9 on S. Typhimurium and S. Typhi replication in vitro. Typhoid fever patients demonstrated a marked increase of S100A8/A9 in acute phase plasma and feces and this increases correlated with duration of fever prior to admission. S100A8/A9 directly inhibited the growth of S. Typhimurium and S. Typhi in vitro in a dose and time dependent fashion. WT mice inoculated with S. Typhimurium showed increased levels of S100A8/A9 in both the liver and the systemic compartment but S100A9(-/-) mice were indistinguishable from WT mice with respect to bacterial growth, survival, and inflammatory responses, as determined by cytokine release, histopathology and organ injury. Conclusion S100A8/A9 is markedly elevated in human typhoid, correlates with duration of fever prior to admission and directly inhibits the growth of S. Typhimurium and S. Typhi in vitro. Despite elevated levels in the murine invasive Salmonella model, S100A8/A9 does not contribute to an effective host response against S. Typhimurium in mice.","[De Jong, Hanna K.; Achouiti, Ahmed; Koh, Gavin C. K.

In February 2013, several individuals with dengue-like illnesses and negative malaria blood smears were identified in Mombasa, Kenya. Dengue was laboratory confirmed and an investigation was conducted to estimate the magnitude of local transmission including a serologic survey to determine incident dengue virus (DENV) infections. Consenting household members provided serum and were questioned regarding exposures and medical history. RTPCR was used to identify current DENV infections and IgM anti-DENV ELISA to identify recent infections. Of 1,500 participants from 701 households, 210 (13%) had evidence of current or recent DENV infection. Among those infected, 93 (44%) reported fever in the past month. Most (68, 73%) febrile infected participants were seen by a clinician and all but one of 32 participants who reportedly received a diagnosis were clinically diagnosed as having malaria. Having open windows at night (OR = 2.3; CI: 1.1-4.8), not using daily mosquito repellent (OR = 1.6; CI: 1.0-2.8), and recent travel outside of Kenya (OR = 2.5; CI: 1.1-5.4) were associated with increased risk of DENV infection.

However, the ingestion of fresh vegetables contaminated by snail mucus and/or water has also been proposed as a source of the infection for some zoonotic metastrongyloids (e.g., Angiostrongylus cantonensis). In the meantime, the feline lungworms Aelurostrongylus abstrusus and Troglostrongylus brevior are increasingly spreading among cat populations, along with their gastropod intermediate hosts. The aim of this study was to assess the potential of alternative transmission pathways for A. abstrusus and T. brevior L3 via the mucus of infected Helix aspersa snails and the water where gastropods died. In addition, the histological examination of snail specimens provided information on the larval localization and inflammatory reactions in the intermediate host. Methodology/Principal Findings Twenty-four specimens of H. aspersa received similar to 500 L1 of A. abstrusus and T. brevior, and were assigned to six study groups. Snails were subjected to different mechanical and chemical stimuli throughout 20 days in order to elicit the production of mucus. At the end of the study, gastropods were submerged in tap water and the sediment was observed for lungworm larvae for three consecutive days. Finally, snails were artificially digested and recovered larvae were counted and morphologically and molecularly identified. The anatomical localization of A. abstrusus and T. brevior larvae within snail tissues was investigated by histology. L3 were detected in the snail mucus (i. e., 37 A. abstrusus and 19 T. brevior) and in the sediment of submerged specimens (172 A. abstrusus and 39 T. brevior). Following the artificial digestion of H. aspersa snails, a mean number of 127.8 A. abstrusus and 60.3 T. brevior larvae were recovered. The number of snail sections positive for A. abstrusus was higher than those for T. brevior. Conclusions Results of this study indicate that A. abstrusus and T. brevior infective L3 are shed in the mucus of H. aspersa or in water where infected gastropods had died submerged. Both elimination pathways may represent alternative route(s) of environmental contamination and source of the infection for these nematodes under field conditions and may significantly affect the epidemiology of feline lungworms. Considering that snails may act as intermediate hosts for other metastrongyloid species, the environmental contamination by mucus-released larvae is discussed in a broader context.","[Giannelli, Alessio; Colella, Vito; Ramos, Rafael Antonio do Nascimento; Dantas-Torres, Filipe; Otranto, Domenico] Univ Bari, Dept Vet Med, Bari, Italy; [Abramo, Francesca] Univ Pisa, Dept Vet Sci, Pisa, Italy; [Falsone, Luigi; Brianti, Emanuele] Univ Messina, Dept Vet Sci, Messina, Italy; [Varcasia, Antonio] Univ Sassari, Dept Vet Med, I-07100 Sassari, Italy; [Dantas-Torres, Filipe] Fundacao Oswaldo Cruz, Aggeu Magalhaes Res Inst, Dept Immunol, Recife, PE, Brazil; [Knaus, Martin] Merial GmbH, Kathrinenhof Res Ctr, Rohrdorf, Germany; [Fox, Mark T.] Univ London, Royal Vet Coll, Dept Pathol & Pathogen Biol, London, England","Giannelli, A (reprint author), Univ Bari, Dept Vet Med, Bari, Italy.",domenico.otranto@uniba.it,"Colella, Vito/A-7661-2016; Varcasia, Antonio/B-7939-2013; Dantas-Torres, Filipe/G-1617-2012","Colella, Vito/0000-0002-4903-1479; Varcasia, Antonio/0000-0001-6306-9978; Giannelli, Alessio/0000-0001-5855-2906; Otranto, Domenico/0000-0002-7518-476X",,,,40,26,27,1,16,PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE,SAN FRANCISCO,"1160 BATTERY STREET, STE 100, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94111 USA",1935-2735,,,PLOS NEGLECT TROP D,Plos Neglect.

We longitudinally characterized infestation of different vehicle types (cars, boats, etc.) to estimate the frequency and intensity of mosquito introductions into novel locations (propagule pressure). Methods Exhaustive adult and immature Ae. aegypti collections were performed on six different vehicle types at five ports and two bus/taxi departure points in the Amazonian city of Iquitos, Peru during 2013. Aquatic vehicles included 32 large and 33 medium-sized barges, 53 water taxis, and 41 speed boats. Terrestrial vehicles sampled included 40 buses and 30 taxis traveling on the only highway in the region. Ae. aegypti adult infestation rates and immature indices were analyzed by vehicle type, location within vehicles, and sampling date. Results Large barges (71.9% infested) and medium barges (39.4% infested) accounted for most of the infestations. Notably, buses had an overall infestation rate of 12.5%. On large barges, the greatest number of Ae. aegypti adults were found in October, whereas most immatures were found in February followed by October. The vast majority of larvae (85.9%) and pupae (76.7%) collected in large barges were produced in puddles formed in cargo holds. Conclusions Because larges barges provide suitable mosquito habitats (due to dark, damp cargo storage spaces and ample oviposition sites), we conclude that they likely serve as significant contributors to mosquitoes' propagule pressure across long distances throughout the Peruvian Amazon. This information can help anticipate vector population mixing and future range expansions of dengue and other viruses transmitted by Ae. aegypti.","[Guagliardo, Sarah Anne; Vazquez-Prokopec, Gonzalo; Kitron, Uriel] Emory Univ, Dept Environm Sci, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA; [Morrison, Amy C.] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Entomol, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Luis Barboza, Jose; Requena, Edwin] Univ Nacl Amazonia Peruana, Iquitos, Peru; [Astete, Helvio] NAMRU 6 Iquitos Lab, US Naval Med Res Unit 6, Iquitos, Peru; [Vazquez-Prokopec, Gonzalo; Kitron, Uriel] NIH, Fogarty Int Ctr, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA","Guagliardo, SA (reprint author), Emory Univ, Dept Environm Sci, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA.",sarah.guagliardo@gmail.com,,,National Institutes of Health [T32 AI55404-10]; Achievement Rewards for College Students (ARCS) Global Health Impact Award; NIH/NIAID [R01 AI069341-01],"Funding for this study was provided by the National Institutes of Health Training Grant in the Population Biology of Infectious Diseases No. T32 AI55404-10 (L Real, PI) and by the Achievement Rewards for College Students (ARCS) Global Health Impact Award.

In The Gambia the PRET study found that discontinuing MDA based on testing a sample of children for ocular Chlamydia trachomatis(Ct) infection after one MDA round had similar effects to continuing MDA for three rounds. Moreover, one round of MDA reduced disease below the 5% TF threshold. We compared the costs of examining a sample of children for TF, and of testing them for Ct, with those of MDA rounds. Methods The implementation unit in PRET The Gambia was a census enumeration area (EA) of 600-800 people. Personnel, fuel, equipment, consumables, data entry and supervision costs were collected for census and treatment of a sample of EAs and for the examination, sampling and testing for Ct infection of 100 individuals within them. Programme costs and resource savings from testing and treatment strategies were inferred for the 102 EAs in the study area, and compared. Results Census costs were $103.24 per EA plus initial costs of $108.79. MDA with donated azithromycin cost $227.23 per EA. The mean cost of examining and testing 100 children was $796.90 per EA, with Ct testing kits costing $4.80 per result. A strategy of testing each EA for infection is more expensive than two annual rounds of MDA unless the kit cost is less than $1.38 per result. However stopping or deciding not to initiate treatment in the study area based on testing a sample of EAs for Ct infection (or examining children in a sample of EAs) creates savings relative to further unnecessary treatments. Conclusion Resources may be saved by using tests for chlamydial infection or clinical examination to determine that initial or subsequent rounds of MDA for trachoma are unnecessary.","[Harding-Esch, Emma; Edwards, Tansy; Holland, Martin; Mabey, David; Bailey, Robin] London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, London WC1, England; [Harding-Esch, Emma] Publ Hlth England, HIV STI Dept, London, England; [Jofre-Bonet, Mireia] City Univ London, Dept Econ, London EC1V 0HB, England; [Dhanjal, Jaskiran K.] Abacus Int, Bicester, Oxon, England; [Burr, Sarah] MRC Labs, Fajara, Gambia; [Sillah, Ansumana] Natl Eye Hlth Programme, Banjul, Gambia; [West, Sheila] Johns Hopkins Univ, Wilmer Eye Inst, Dana Ctr Prevent Ophthalmol, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA; [Lietman, Tom; Keenan, Jeremy] Univ Calif San Francisco, Francis I Proctor Fdn, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA","Harding-Esch, E (reprint author), London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, London WC1, England.",Robin.Bailey@lshtm.ac.uk,"Jofre-Bonet, Mireia/V-8673-2019; Holland, Martin J/K-6502-2012","Jofre-Bonet, Mireia/0000-0002-2055-2166; Holland, Martin J/0000-0002-5828-6318; Burr, Sarah/0000-0002-1780-3403; Mabey, David/0000-0002-0031-8276",Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation [48027]; Medical Research Council [MR/K012126/1],"This study was supported by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation www.gatesfoundation.org grant 48027.

We have studied the National Health System's Hospital Discharge Records Database (CMBD) in order to describe the disease evolution from 1997 to 2011 in Spain. We performed a retrospective descriptive study using CMBD information on hospitalizations including Chagas disease. Data was divided in two periods with similar length in time: 1997-2004 and 2005-2011. Hospitalization rates were calculated and clinical characteristics were described. We used multivariable logistic regression to calculate adjusted odds-ratio (aOR) for the association between various conditions and being hospitalized with organ affectation. A total of 1729 hospitalization records were identified. Hospitalization rates for the two periods were 18 and 242.8/100000 population, respectively. The median age was 35 years (range 0-87), 74% were female and the 16-45 age-group was mostly represented (69.8%). Overall, 23.4% hospitalizations included the diagnosis of Chagas disease with organ complications. Being male [aOR: 1.3 (1.00-1.77)], aged 45 and 64 years [ aOR: 2.59 (1.42-4.71)], and a median hospitalization cost above 3,065 euro [aOR: 2.03 (3.73-7.86)] were associated with hospitalizations with organ affectation.

This fact points towards the relevance of assessing the influence of age-related comorbidities, such as diabetes, on the clinical presentation of dengue episodes. Identification of factors associated with a severe presentation is of high relevance, because timely treatment is the most important intervention to avert complications and death. This review summarizes and evaluates the published evidence on the association between diabetes and the risk of a severe clinical presentation of dengue. Methodology/Findings A systematic literature review was conducted using the MEDLINE database to access any relevant association between dengue and diabetes. Five case-control studies (4 hospital-based, 1 population-based) compared the prevalence of diabetes (self-reported or abstracted from medical records) of persons with dengue (acute or past; controls) and patients with severe clinical manifestations. All except one study were conducted before 2009 and all studies collected information towards WHO 1997 classification system. The reported odds ratios were formally summarized by random-effects meta-analyses. A diagnosis of diabetes was associated with an increased risk for a severe clinical presentation of dengue (OR 1.75; 95% CI: 1.08-2.84, p = 0.022). Conclusions/Significance Large prospective studies that systematically and objectively obtain relevant signs and symptoms of dengue fever episodes as well as of hyperglycemia in the past, and at the time of dengue diagnosis, are needed to properly address the effect of diabetes on the clinical presentation of an acute dengue fever episode. The currently available epidemiological evidence is very limited and only suggestive. The increasing global prevalence of both dengue and diabetes justifies further studies. At this point, confirmation of dengue infection as early as possible in diabetes patients with fever if living in dengue endemic regions seems justified. The presence of this co-morbidity may warrant closer observation for glycemic control and adapted fluid management to diminish the risk for a severe clinical presentation of dengue.","[Htun, Nan Shwe Nwe; Odermatt, Peter; Eze, Ikenna C.; Boillat-Blanco, Noemie; D'Acremont, Valerie; Probst-Hensch, Nicole] Swiss Trop & Publ Hlth Inst, Dept Epidemiol & Publ Hlth, Basel, Switzerland; [Htun, Nan Shwe Nwe; Odermatt, Peter; Eze, Ikenna C.; Boillat-Blanco, Noemie; D'Acremont, Valerie; Probst-Hensch, Nicole] Univ Basel, Basel, Switzerland; [Boillat-Blanco, Noemie] Univ Lausanne Hosp, Infect Dis Serv, Lausanne, Switzerland; [D'Acremont, Valerie] Univ Lausanne, Dept Ambulatory Care & Community Med, Lausanne, Switzerland","Htun, NSN (reprint author), Swiss Trop & Publ Hlth Inst, Dept Epidemiol & Publ Hlth, Basel, Switzerland.",Nicole.Probst@unibas.ch,"Odermatt, Peter/K-7727-2015","Odermatt, Peter/0000-0002-0296-2508; Boillat-Blanco, Noemie/0000-0002-2490-8174; Eze, Ikenna/0000-0001-9748-2162",,,,46,24,24,1,9,PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE,SAN FRANCISCO,"1160 BATTERY STREET, STE 100, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94111 USA",1935-2735,,,PLOS NEGLECT TROP D,Plos Neglect.

This dynamical change might indicate periodicity of the disease, and its understanding could significantly improve targeted interventions to reduce the burden of schistosomiasis. The goal of this study was to investigate how the schistosomiasis risk varied temporally and spatially in recent years. Methodology/Principal Findings Parasitological data were obtained through repeated cross-sectional surveys that were carried out during 1997-2010 in Anhui Province, East China. A multivariate autoregressive model, combined with principal oscillation pattern (POP) analysis, was used to evaluate the spatio-temporal variation of schistosomiasis risk. Results showed that the temporal changes of schistosomiasis risk in the study area could be decomposed into two sustained damped oscillatory modes with estimated period of approximately 2.5 years. The POPs associated with these oscillatory components showed that the pattern near the Yangtze River varied markedly and that the disease risk appeared to evolve in a Southwest/Northeast orientation. The POP coefficients showed decreasing tendency until 2001, then increasing during 2002-2005 and decaying afterwards. Conclusion The POP analysis characterized the variations of schistosomiasis risk over space and time and demonstrated that the disease mainly varied temporally along the Yangtze River. The schistosomiasis risk declined periodically with a temporal fluctuation. Whether it resulted from previous national control strategies on schistosomiasis needs further investigations.","[Hu, Yi; Li, Rui; Zhang, Zhijie; Jiang, Qingwu] Fudan Univ, Dept Epidemiol, Sch Publ Hlth, Shanghai 200433, Peoples R China; [Hu, Yi; Li, Rui; Zhang, Zhijie; Jiang, Qingwu] Minist Educ, Key Lab Publ Hlth Safety, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Hu, Yi; Li, Rui; Zhang, Zhijie; Jiang, Qingwu] Fudan Univ, Lab Spatial Anal & Modeling, Sch Publ Hlth, Shanghai 200433, Peoples R China; [Chen, Yue] Univ Ottawa, Fac Med, Sch Epidemiol Publ Hlth & Prevent Med, Ottawa, ON, Canada; [Gao, Fenghua; Wang, Qizhi; Zhang, Shiqing] Anhui Inst Parasit Dis, Wuhu, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Zhijie] Fudan Univ, Biomed Stat Ctr, Shanghai 200433, Peoples R China","Hu, Y (reprint author), Fudan Univ, Dept Epidemiol, Sch Publ Hlth, Shanghai 200433, Peoples R China.",epistat@gmail.com,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China [81102167, 81172609, J1210041]; Specialized Research Fund for the Doctoral Program of Higher Education, SRFDP [20110071120040]; Foundation for the Author of National Excellent Doctoral Dissertation of PR China (FANEDD) [201186]; National ST Major Program [2012ZX10004220, 2008ZX10004-011]; Talent Programs for Fostering Outstanding Youth of Shanghai [XYQ2013071]; Independent Research Project of Fudan University [20520133105]; Opening Fund of Key Laboratory of Poyang Lake Wetland and Watershed Research (Jiangxi Normal University), Ministry of Education [PK2014001]; China Postdoctoral Science Foundation [2014M560291]","This research was supported by grants awarded to YH, ZZ, QJ and National Natural Science Foundation of China [grants number: 81102167, 81172609, and J1210041], Specialized Research Fund for the Doctoral Program of Higher Education, SRFDP (grant number: 20110071120040), a Foundation for the Author of National Excellent Doctoral Dissertation of PR China (FANEDD) (201186), the National S&T Major Program (2012ZX10004220, 2008ZX10004-011), the Talent Programs for Fostering Outstanding Youth of Shanghai (XYQ2013071), the Independent Research Project of Fudan University (20520133105), the Opening Fund of Key Laboratory of Poyang Lake Wetland and Watershed Research (Jiangxi Normal University), Ministry of Education (PK2014001), and the China Postdoctoral Science Foundation (No. 2014M560291).

Methods/Principal Findings We retrospectively analyzed 39 consecutive patients with VNSSTIs (mean age: 65.7 +/- 11.3 years) at our institution between 2007 and 2010. All patients were treated with the same protocol. Demographic and clinical characteristics, disease severity on admission, treatment details, and outcomes were collected for each patient and extracted for analyses. We studied the predictive value of the model for end-stage liver disease (MELD), modified MELD including sodium (MELD-Na), and laboratory risk indicator for necrotizing fasciitis (LRINEC) scores for case-fatality. Logistic regression and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analyses were performed. The mean MELD, MELD-Na and LRINEC scores on admission were 15.1 +/- 1.1, 17.7 +/- 1.1, and 3.4 +/- 0.4 points, respectively. After admission, these patients had temporary or progressive deterioration of nearly all their scores and lab values. The area under the ROC curve for the MELD and Delta MELD scoring models were 0.929 (p = 0.002) and 0.897 (p = 0.005), respectively. An optimal MELD/Delta MELD cutoff value >= 20/2 had a good sensitivity and specificity (all > 80%), with a 64/13-fold increased odds for case-fatality. Additionally, the development of severe forms of anemia (p = 0.014) and hypoalbuminemia (p = 0.019) were associated with an increased case-fatality rate. Discussion The MELD/Delta MELD scoring model is an effective risk stratification indicator at the time of admission and also an excellent condition monitor during hospitalization for medical care of acutely and/or critically ill patients with VNSSTIs.","[Huang, Kuo-Chin; Tsai, Yao-Hung; Lee, Mel S.] Chang Gung Mem Hosp, Dept Orthopaed Surg, Chiayi, Taiwan; [Huang, Kuo-Chin; Tsai, Yao-Hung; Lee, Mel S.] Chang Gung Univ, Coll Med, Taoyuan, Taiwan; [Huang, Kuo-Chung] Nanhua Univ, Dept Business Adm Stat, Chiayi, Taiwan","Huang, KC (reprint author), Chang Gung Mem Hosp, Dept Orthopaed Surg, Chiayi, Taiwan.",kc2672@gmail.com,,,Chang Gung Memorial Hospital in Taiwan [CORPG6E0071],This work was supported in part by grants from the Chang Gung Memorial Hospital in Taiwan (Grant No. CORPG6E0071 to Kuo-Chin Huang).,,32,4,6,0,0,PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE,SAN FRANCISCO,"1160 BATTERY STREET, STE 100, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94111 USA",1935-2735,,,PLOS NEGLECT TROP D,Plos Neglect.

Traditional vector control strategies have been largely ineffective against Ae. albopictus and novel approaches are urgently needed. Photoperiodic diapause is a crucial ecological adaptation in a wide range of temperate insects. Therefore, targeting the molecular regulation of photoperiodic diapause or diapause-associated physiological processes could provide the basis of novel approaches to vector control. Methodology/Principal Findings We investigated the global transcriptional profiles of diapause induction in Ae. albopictus by performing paired-end RNA-Seq of biologically replicated libraries. We sequenced RNA from whole bodies of adult females reared under diapause-inducing and non-diapause-inducing photoperiods either with or without a blood meal. We constructed a comprehensive transcriptome assembly that incorporated previous assemblies and represents over 14,000 annotated dipteran gene models. Mapping of sequence reads to the transcriptome identified differential expression of 2,251 genes in response to diapause-inducing short-day photoperiods. In non-blood-fed females, potential regulatory elements of diapause induction were transcriptionally up-regulated, including two of the canonical circadian clock genes, timeless and cryptochrome 1. In blood-fed females, genes in metabolic pathways related to energy production and offspring provisioning were differentially expressed under diapause-inducing conditions, including the oxidative phosphorylation pathway and lipid metabolism genes. Conclusions/Significance This study is the first to utilize powerful RNA-Seq technologies to elucidate the transcriptional basis of diapause induction in any insect. We identified candidate genes and pathways regulating diapause induction, including a conserved set of genes that are differentially expressed as part of the diapause program in a diverse group of insects. These genes provide candidates whose diapause-associated function can be further interrogated using functional genomics approaches in Ae. albopictus and other insects.","[Huang, Xin; Poelchau, Monica F.; Armbruster, Peter A.] Georgetown Univ, Dept Biol, Washington, DC 20057 USA","Huang, X (reprint author), Georgetown Univ, Dept Biol, Washington, DC 20057 USA.",xh33@georgetown.edu,"Huang, Xin/I-5015-2019","Huang, Xin/0000-0003-2466-4373; Poelchau, Monica/0000-0002-4584-6056",National Institutes of Health [1R15AI111328-01]; Georgetown University Center for the Environment; Georgetown University Environment Initiative,"This work was supported by the National Institutes of Health (grant no. 1R15AI111328-01 to PAA) (http://www.nih.gov/), Georgetown University Center for the Environment (http://cfe.georgetown.edu/) and the Georgetown University Environment Initiative (https://environment.georgetown.edu/).

Since the majority of infections are asymptomatic, surveillance systems substantially underestimate true rates of infection. With advances in the development of novel control measures, obtaining robust estimates of average dengue transmission intensity is key for assessing both the burden of disease from dengue and the likely impact of interventions. Methodology/Principal Findings The force of infection (lambda) and corresponding basic reproduction numbers (R-0) for dengue were estimated from non-serotype (IgG) and serotype-specific (PRNT) age-stratified sero-prevalence surveys identified from the literature. The majority of R-0 estimates ranged from 1-4. Assuming that two heterologous infections result in complete immunity produced up to two-fold higher estimates of R-0 than when tertiary and quaternary infections were included. lambda estimated from IgG data were comparable to the sum of serotype-specific forces of infection derived from PRNT data, particularly when inter-serotype interactions were allowed for. Conclusions/Significance Our analysis highlights the highly heterogeneous nature of dengue transmission. How underlying assumptions about serotype interactions and immunity affect the relationship between the force of infection and R-0 will have implications for control planning. While PRNT data provides the maximum information, our study shows that even the much cheaper ELISA-based assays would provide comparable baseline estimates of overall transmission intensity which will be an important consideration in resource-constrained settings.","[Imai, Natsuko; Dorigatti, Ilaria; Ferguson, Neil M.] Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Dept Infect Dis Epidemiol, MRC Ctr Outbreak Anal & Modelling, London, England; [Cauchemez, Simon] Inst Pasteur, Math Modelling Infect Dis Unit, Paris, France","Imai, N (reprint author), Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Dept Infect Dis Epidemiol, MRC Ctr Outbreak Anal & Modelling, London, England.",n.imai12@imperial.ac.uk,"Imai, Natsuko/J-5817-2017; Ferguson, Neil/B-8578-2008","Imai, Natsuko/0000-0002-4218-9716; Ferguson, Neil/0000-0002-1154-8093; Dorigatti, Ilaria/0000-0001-9959-0706","Medical Research Council; Medical Research Council [MR/K010174/1, MR/K010174/1B, 1246259]; National Institute for Health Research [NF-SI-0508-10252]","NI was funded by the Medical Research Council as part of her PhD.

Previous population genetic studies have revealed a particular genetic structure among the vector populations in the Americas that suggests differences in the ability to transmit DENV. In Colombia, despite its high epidemiologic importance, the genetic population structure and the phylogeographic depiction of Ae. aegypti, as well as its relationship with the epidemiologic landscapes in cities with heterogeneous incidence levels, remains unknown. We conducted a spatiotemporal analysis with the aim of determining the genetic structure and phylogeography of Colombian populations of Ae. aegypti among cities with different eco-epidemiologic characteristics with regard to DENV. Methods/Findings Mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase C subunit 1 (COI) - NADH dehydrogenase subunit 4 (ND4) genes were sequenced and analyzed from 341 adult mosquitoes collected during 2012 and 2013 in the Colombian cities of Bello, Riohacha and Villavicencio, which exhibit low, medium and high levels of incidence of DENV, respectively. The results demonstrated a low genetic differentiation over time and a high genetic structure between the cities due to changes in the frequency of two highly supported genetic groups. The phylogeographic analyses indicated that one group (associated with West African populations) was found in all the cities throughout the sampling while the second group (associated with East African populations) was found in all the samples from Bello and in only one sampling from Riohacha. Environmental factors such as the use of chemical insecticides showed a significant correlation with decreasing genetic diversity, indicating that environmental factors affect the population structure of Ae. aegypti across time and space in these cities. Conclusions Our results suggest that two Ae. aegypti lineages are present in Colombia; one that is widespread and related to a West African conspecific, and a second that may have been recently introduced and is related to an East African conspecific. The first lineage can be found in cities showing a high incidence of dengue fever and the use of chemical insecticides, whereas the second is present in cities showing a low incidence of dengue fever where the use of chemical insecticides is not constant. This study helps to improve our knowledge of the population structure of Ae. aegypti involved in the diversity of dengue fever epidemiology in Colombia.","[Jaimes-Duenez, Jeiczon; Arboleda, Sair; Triana-Chavez, Omar; Gomez-Palacio, Andres] Univ Antioquia UdeA, Grp Biol & Control Enfermedades Infecciosas BCEI, Medellin, Colombia","Jaimes-Duenez, J (reprint author), Univ Antioquia UdeA, Grp Biol & Control Enfermedades Infecciosas BCEI, Medellin, Colombia.",amgomezpa@gmail.com,,"Gomez-Palacio, Andres/0000-0002-1069-9199; Triana, Omar/0000-0001-8031-0225",Estrategia de sostenibilidad CODI - Universidad de Antioquia; COLCIENCIAS [111554531424],"The authors received financial support from Estrategia de sostenibilidad 2015-2016 CODI - Universidad de Antioquia and COLCIENCIAS project # 111554531424.

Methodology/Principal findings Using ex vivo IFN gamma ELISpot assays, and by determining cytokines produced in ELISpot supernatants, we investigated the functionality of DENV-specific memory T cell responses in a large cohort of individuals from Sri Lanka (n=338), who were naturally infected and were either hospitalized due to dengue or had mild or sub clinical dengue infection. We found that T cells of individuals with both past mild or sub clinical dengue infection and who were hospitalized produced multiple cytokines when stimulated with DENV-NS3 peptides. However, while DENV-NS3 specific T cells of those with mild/sub clinical dengue infection were more likely to produce only granzyme B (p=0.02), those who were hospitalized were more likely to produce both TNF alpha and IFN gamma (p=0.03) or TNF alpha alone. We have also investigated the usefulness of a novel T cell based assay, which can be used to determine the past infecting DENV serotype. 92.4% of DENV seropositive individuals responded to at least one DENV serotype of this assay and none of the seronegatives responded. Individuals who were seronegative, but had received the Japanese encephalitis vaccine too made no responses, suggesting that the peptides used in this assay did not cross react with the Japanese encephalitis virus. Conclusions/significance The types of cytokines produced by DENV-specific memory T cells appear to influence the outcome of clinical disease severity. The novel T cell based assay, is likely to be useful in determining the past infecting DENV serotype in immune-epidemiological studies and also in dengue vaccine trials.","[Jeewandara, Chandima; Adikari, Thiruni N.; Gomes, Laksiri; Fernando, Samitha; Fernando, R.

Comparisons of the genetic structure of sympatric parasite populations may provide insight into the mechanisms underlying the resilience of P. vivax and can help guide malaria control programs. Methodology/Principle findings P. vivax isolates representing the parasite populations of four areas on the north coast of Papua New Guinea (PNG) were genotyped using microsatellite markers and compared with previously published microsatellite data from sympatric P. falciparum isolates. The genetic diversity of P. vivax (H-e = 0.83-0.85) was higher than that of P. falciparum (H-e = 0.64-0.77) in all four populations. Moderate levels of genetic differentiation were found between P. falciparum populations, even over relatively short distances (less than 50 km), with 21-28% private alleles and clear geospatial genetic clustering. Conversely, very low population differentiation was found between P. vivax catchments, with less than 5% private alleles and no genetic clustering observed. In addition, the effective population size of P. vivax (30353; 13043-69142) was larger than that of P. falciparum (18871; 8109-42986). Conclusions/Significance Despite comparably high prevalence, P. vivax had higher diversity and a panmictic population structure compared to sympatric P. falciparum populations, which were fragmented into subpopulations. The results suggest that in comparison to P. falciparum, P. vivax has had a long-term large effective population size, consistent with more intense and stable transmission, and limited impact of past control and elimination efforts. This underlines suggestions that more intensive and sustained interventions will be needed to control and eventually eliminate P. vivax. This research clearly demonstrates how population genetic analyses can reveal deeper insight into transmission patterns than traditional surveillance methods.","[Jennison, Charlie; Arnott, Alicia; Tessier, Natacha; Koepfli, Cristian; Bahlo, Melanie; Mueller, Ivo; Barry, Alyssa E.] Walter & Eliza Hall Inst Med Res, Div Infect & Immun, Melbourne, Vic 3050, Australia; [Jennison, Charlie; Arnott, Alicia; Koepfli, Cristian; Bahlo, Melanie; Barry, Alyssa E.] Univ Melbourne, Dept Med Biol, Parkville, Vic 3052, Australia; [Tavul, Livingstone; Siba, Peter M.] Papua New Guinea Inst Med Res, Goroka, Eastern Highlan, Papua N Guinea; [Felger, Ingrid] Swiss Trop & Publ Hlth Inst, Basel, Switzerland; [Reeder, John C.] Burnet Inst, Ctr Populat Hlth, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Bahlo, Melanie] Univ Melbourne, Dept Math & Stat, Parkville, Vic 3052, Australia; [Mueller, Ivo] Barcelona Ctr Int Hlth Res, Barcelona, Spain","Jennison, C (reprint author), Walter & Eliza Hall Inst Med Res, Div Infect & Immun, Melbourne, Vic 3050, Australia.",barry@wehi.edu.au,"Koepfli, Cristian/H-8772-2019","Koepfli, Cristian/0000-0002-9354-0414; Reeder, John/0000-0003-1395-1289; Felger, Ingrid/0000-0003-1255-2606; Jennison, Charlie/0000-0002-8138-9999","National Health and Medical Research Council of Australia [488122, 1003825]; NHMRC; Australian Research Council","The research is supported by a Project Grants from the National Health and Medical Research Council of Australia (Nos. 488122 and 1003825).

Recent studies have initiated a paradigm shift to comprehend the immunological interactions of Wolbachia and its antigens in inflammation, apoptosis, lymphocyte anergy, etc. Here we showed that recombinant Wolbachia heat shock protein 60 (rWmhsp60) interacts with TLR-4 and induces apoptosis in monocytes of endemic normal but not in chronic patients. Higher levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) induced after TLR-4 stimulation resulted in loss of mitochondrial membrane potential and caspase cascade activation, which are the plausible reason for apoptosis. Furthermore, release in ROS owing to TLR-4 signaling resulted in the activation of NF-kappa B p65 nuclear translocation which leads to inflammation and apoptosis via TNF receptor pathway following the increase in IL-6 and TNF-alpha level. Here for the first time, we report that in addition to apoptosis, rWmhsp60 antigen in filarial pathogenesis also induces molecular senescence in monocytes. Targeting TLR-4, therefore, presents a promising candidate for treating rWmhsp60-induced apoptosis and senescence. Strikingly, induction of autophagy by rapamycin detains TLR-4 in late endosomes and subverts TLR-4-rWmhsp60 interaction, thus protecting TLR-4-mediated apoptosis and senescence. Furthermore, rapamycin-induced monocytes were unresponsive to rWmhsp60, and activated lymphocytes following PHA stimulation. This study demonstrates that autophagy mediates the degradation of TLR-4 signaling and protects monocytes from rWmhsp60 induced apoptosis and senescence.","[Kamalakannan, Vijayan; Narayanan, Rangarajan Badri] Anna Univ, Ctr Biotechnol, Madras 600025, Tamil Nadu, India; [Shiny, Abijit] Madras Diabet Res Fdn, Madras, Tamil Nadu, India; [Shiny, Abijit] Dr Mohans Diabet Specialties Ctr, Madras, Tamil Nadu, India; [Babu, Subash] Natl Inst Res TB, Natl Inst Hlth, Int Ctr Excellence Res, Madras, Tamil Nadu, India","Kamalakannan, V (reprint author), Anna Univ, Ctr Biotechnol, Madras 600025, Tamil Nadu, India.",rbn@annauniv.edu,,,"Department of Biotechnology, India","This work was funded by the Department of Biotechnology, India.

Very little is known about the risk for colon cancer in chagasic megacolon patients. To clarify whether chagasic megacolon impacts on colon carcinogenesis, we investigated the risk for colon cancer in Trypanosoma cruzi (T. cruzi) infected patients and rats. Methods Colon samples from T. cruzi-infected and uninfected patients and rats were histopathologically investigated with colon cancer biomarkers. An experimental model for chemical myenteric denervation was also performed to verify the myenteric neuronal effects on colon carcinogenesis. All experiments complied the guidelines and approval of ethical institutional review boards. Results No colon tumors were found in chagasic megacolon samples. A significant myenteric neuronal denervation was observed. Epithelial cell proliferation and hyperplasia were found increased in chagasic megacolon. Analyzing the argyrophilic nucleolar organiser regions within the cryptal bottom revealed reduced risk for colon cancer in Chagas' megacolon patients. T. cruzi-infected rats showed a significant myenteric neuronal denervation and decreased numbers of colon preneoplastic lesions. In chemical myenteric denervated rats preneoplastic lesions were reduced from the 2nd wk onward, which ensued having the colon myenteric denervation significantly induced. Conclusion/Significance Our data suggest that the trypanosomiasis-related myenteric neuronal degeneration protects the colon tissue from carcinogenic events. Current findings highlight potential mechanisms in tropical diseases and cancer research.","[Kannen, Vinicius; Motta, Bruno Zene; Chaguri, Annuar Jose; Brunaldi, Mariangela Ottoboni; Garcia, Sergio B.] Univ Sao Paulo, Dept Pathol, BR-14049 Ribeirao Preto, Brazil; [de Oliveira, Enio C.] Univ Fed Goias, Sch Med, Dept Surg, Goiania, Go, Brazil","Kannen, V (reprint author), Univ Sao Paulo, Dept Pathol, BR-14049 Ribeirao Preto, Brazil.",vinicius.kannen@cirp.usp.br,"Garcia, sergio/O-6025-2016; Kannen, Vinicius/L-5972-2016","Garcia, sergio/0000-0003-1630-3543; Kannen, Vinicius/0000-0001-6290-8063; Brunaldi, Mariangela/0000-0002-7404-6779","National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq, Brazil) [401860/2013-2]","This study was fully supported by a Research Grant (no401860/2013-2) from the National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq, Brazil).

Typhi) in endemic areas. However, immune responses and clinical findings in children are not well defined. Here, we describe clinical and immunological characteristics of young children with S. Typhi bacteremia, and antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of isolated strains. Methods As a marker of recent infection, we have previously characterized antibody-in-lymphocyte secretion (TPTest) during acute typhoid fever in adults. We similarly assessed membrane preparation (MP) IgA responses in young children at clinical presentation, and then 7-10 days and 21-28 days later. We also assessed plasma IgA, IgG and IgM responses and T cell proliferation responses to MP at these time points. We compared responses in young children (1-5 years) with those seen in older children (6-17 years), adults (18-59 years), and age-matched healthy controls. Principal Findings We found that, compared to age-matched controls patients in all age cohorts had significantly more MP-IgA responses in lymphocyte secretion at clinical presentation, and the values fell in all groups by late convalescence. Similarly, plasma IgA responses in patients were elevated at presentation compared to controls, with acute and convalescent IgA and IgG responses being highest in adults. T cell proliferative responses increased in all age cohorts by late convalescence. Clinical characteristics were similar in all age cohorts, although younger children were more likely to present with loss of appetite, less likely to complain of headache compared to older cohorts, and adults were more likely to have ingested antibiotics. Multi-drug resistant strains were present in approximately 15% of each age cohort, and 97% strains had resistance to nalidixic acid. Conclusions This study demonstrates that S. Typhi bacteremia is associated with comparable clinical courses, immunologic responses in various age cohorts, including in young children, and that TPTest can be used as marker of recent typhoid fever, even in young children.","[Khanam, Farhana; Abu Sayeed, Md.; Choudhury, Feroza Kaneez; Sheikh, Alaullah; Ahmed, Dilruba; Goswami, Doli; Hossain, Md.

More than 99% of all current cases are found in sub-Saharan Africa. Fortunately, vector control and community-directed treatment with ivermectin have significantly reduced morbidity. Studies in Mali and Senegal proved the feasibility of elimination with ivermectin administration. The treatment goal is shifting from control to elimination in endemic African regions. Given limited resources, national and global policymakers need a rigorous analysis comparing investment options. For this, we developed scenarios for alternative treatment goals and compared treatment timelines and drug needs between the scenarios. Control, elimination, and eradication scenarios were developed with reference to current standard practices, large-scale studies, and historical data. For each scenario, the timeline when treatment is expected to stop at country level was predicted using a dynamical transmission model, and ivermectin treatment needs were predicted based on population in endemic areas, treatment coverage data, and the frequency of community-directed treatment. The control scenario requires community-directed treatment with ivermectin beyond 2045 with around 2.63 billion treatments over 2013-2045; the elimination scenario, until 2028 in areas where feasible, but beyond 2045 in countries with operational challenges, around 1.15 billion treatments; and the eradication scenario, lasting until 2040, around 1.30 billion treatments. The eradication scenario is the most favorable in terms of the timeline of the intervention phase and treatment needs. For its realization, strong health systems and political will are required to overcome epidemiological and political challenges.","[Kim, Young Eun; Steinmann, Peter; Tediosi, Fabrizio] Swiss Trop & Publ Hlth Inst, Basel, Switzerland; [Kim, Young Eun; Steinmann, Peter; Tediosi, Fabrizio] Univ Basel, Basel, Switzerland; [Remme, Jan H.

Current control focuses on community-directed treatment with ivermectin (CDTI). In Ghana, persistent transmission has been reported despite long-term control. We present spatial and temporal patterns of onchocerciasis transmission in relation to ivermectin treatment history. Methodology/Principal Findings Host-seeking and ovipositing blackflies were collected from seven villages in four regions of Ghana with 3-24 years of CDTI at the time of sampling. A total of 16,443 flies was analysed for infection; 5,812 (35.3%) were dissected for parity (26.9% parous). Heads and thoraces of 12,196 flies were dissected for Onchocerca spp. and DNA from 11,122 abdomens was amplified using Onchocerca primers. A total of 463 larvae (0.03 larvae/fly) from 97 (0.6%) infected and 62 (0.4%) infective flies was recorded; 258 abdomens (2.3%) were positive for Onchocerca DNA. Infections (all were O. volvulus) were more likely to be detected in ovipositing flies. Transmission occurred, mostly in the wet season, at Gyankobaa and Bosomase, with transmission potentials of, respectively, 86 and 422 L3/person/month after 3 and 6 years of CDTI. The numbers of L3/1,000 parous flies at these villages were over 100 times the WHO threshold of one L3/1,000 for transmission control. Vector species influenced transmission parameters. At Asubende, the number of L3/1,000 ovipositing flies (1.4, 95% CI = 0-4) also just exceeded the threshold despite extensive vector control and 24 years of ivermectin distribution, but there were no infective larvae in host-seeking flies. Conclusions/Significance Despite repeated ivermectin treatment, evidence of O. volvulus transmission was documented in all seven villages and above the WHO threshold in two. Vector species influences transmission through biting and parous rates and vector competence, and should be included in transmission models. Oviposition traps could augment vector collector methods for monitoring and surveillance.","[Lamberton, Poppy H.

T. cruzi is highly genetically diverse, and multiclonal infections in individual hosts are common, but little studied. In this study, we explore T. cruzi infection multiclonality in the context of age, sex and clinical profile among a cohort of chronic patients, as well as paired congenital cases from Cochabamba, Bolivia and Goias, Brazil using amplicon deep sequencing technology. Methodology/Principal Findings A 450bp fragment of the trypomastigote TcGP63I surface protease gene was amplified and sequenced across 70 chronic and 22 congenital cases on the Illumina MiSeq platform. In addition, a second, mitochondrial target-ND5-was sequenced across the same cohort of cases. Several million reads were generated, and sequencing read depths were normalized within patient cohorts (Goias chronic, n = 43, Goias congenital n = 2, Bolivia chronic, n = 27; Bolivia congenital, n = 20), Among chronic cases, analyses of variance indicated no clear correlation between intra-host sequence diversity and age, sex or symptoms, while principal coordinate analyses showed no clustering by symptoms between patients. Between congenital pairs, we found evidence for the transmission of multiple sequence types from mother to infant, as well as widespread instances of novel genotypes in infants. Finally, nonsynonymous to synonymous (dn:ds) nucleotide substitution ratios among sequences of TcGP63Ia and TcGP63Ib subfamilies within each cohort provided powerful evidence of strong diversifying selection at this locus. Conclusions/Significance Our results shed light on the diversity of parasite DTUs within each patient, as well as the extent to which parasite strains pass between mother and foetus in congenital cases. Although we were unable to find any evidence that parasite diversity accumulates with age in our study cohorts, putative diversifying selection within members of the TcGP63I gene family suggests a link between genetic diversity within this gene family and survival in the mammalian host.","[Llewellyn, Martin S.; Messenger, Louisa A.; Miles, Michael A.] London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, London WC1, England; [Llewellyn, Martin S.] Univ Wales, Sch Biol Sci, Mol Ecol & Fisheries Genet Lab, Bangor, Gwynedd, Wales; [Luquetti, Alejandro O.; Tavares, Suelene B.

Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) ran a VL treatment clinic in the most endemic district (Fulbaria) between 2010 and 2013 using a semi-ambulatory regimen for primary VL of 15mg/kg Liposomal Amphotericin-B (AmBisome) in three equal doses of 5mg/kg. The main objective of this study was to analyze the effectiveness and safety of this regimen after a 12 month follow-up period by retrospective analysis of routinely collected program data. A secondary objective was to explore risk factors for relapse. Methods and Principal Findings Our analysis included 1521 patients who were initially cured, of whom 1278 (84%) and 1179 (77.5%) were followed-up at 6 and 12 months, respectively. Cure rates at 6 and 12 months were 98.7% (1262/1278) and 96.4% (1137/1179), respectively. Most relapses (26/39) occurred between 6 and 12 months after treatment. Serious adverse events (SAE) were recorded for 7 patients (0.5%). Odds of relapse at 12 months were highest in the youngest and oldest age groups. There was some evidence that spleen size measured on discharge (one month after initiation of treatment) was associated with risk of relapse: OR=1.25 (95% CI 1.01 to 1.55) per cm below lower costal margin (P=0.04). Conclusions Our study demonstrates that 15mg/kg AmBisome in three doses of 5mg/kg is an effective (> 95% cure rate) and safe (< 1% SAE) treatment for primary VL in Bangladesh. The majority of relapses occurred between 6 and 12 months, justifying the use of a longer follow-up period when feasible. Assessment of risk of relapse based on easily measured clinical parameters such as spleen size could be incorporated in VL treatment protocols in resource-poor settings where test-of-cure is not always feasible.","[Lucero, Emiliano] Charite Univ Med Berlin, Inst Trop Med & Int Hlth, Berlin, Germany; [Lucero, Emiliano] Univ Nacl Cordoba, Ctr Estudios & Invest Enfermedad Chagas & Leishma, RA-5000 Cordoba, Argentina; [Collin, Simon M.] Univ Bristol, Sch Social & Community Med, Bristol BS8 1TH, Avon, England; [Gomes, Sujit; Akter, Fatima; Asad, Asaduzzam; Das, Asish Kumar] Med Sans Frontieres, Fulbaria, Bangladesh; [Ritmeijer, Koert] Med Sans Frontieres, Amsterdam, Netherlands","Lucero, E (reprint author), Charite Univ Med Berlin, Inst Trop Med & Int Hlth, Berlin, Germany.",koert.ritmeijer@amsterdam.msf.org,,"Collin, Simon/0000-0002-1239-1681; Lucero, Emiliano/0000-0003-2695-1245",,,,31,14,15,0,3,PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE,SAN FRANCISCO,"1160 BATTERY STREET, STE 100, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94111 USA",1935-2735,,,PLOS NEGLECT TROP D,Plos Neglect.

The attenuated YF virus vaccine, which is used worldwide, generates both long-lasting neutralizing antibodies and strong T-cell responses. However, on rare occasions, this vaccine has toxic side effects that can be fatal. This study presents the design of two non-viral DNA-based antigen formulations and the characterization of their expression and immunological properties. The two antigen formulations consist of DNA encoding the full-length envelope protein (p/YFE) or the full-length envelope protein fused to the lysosomal-associated membrane protein signal, LAMP-1 (pL/YFE), aimed at diverting antigen processing/presentation through the major histocompatibility complex II precursor compartments. The immune responses triggered by these formulations were evaluated in H2b and H2d backgrounds, corresponding to the C57Bl/6 and BALB/c mice strains, respectively. Both DNA constructs were able to induce very strong T-cell responses of similar magnitude against almost all epitopes that are also generated by the YF 17DD vaccine. The pL/YFE formulation performed best overall. In addition to the T-cell response, it was also able to stimulate high titers of anti-YF neutralizing antibodies comparable to the levels elicited by the 17DD vaccine. More importantly, the pL/YFE vaccine conferred 100% protection against the YF virus in intracerebrally challenged mice. These results indicate that pL/YFE DNA is an excellent vaccine candidate and should be considered for further developmental studies.","[Maciel, Milton, Jr.; August, Joseph Thomas; Marques, Ernesto T.

Better understanding and addressing these barriers may enhance the effectiveness of HAT control. Methods We performed a qualitative study consisting of semi-structured interviews and focus group discussions in the Bandundu and Kasai Oriental provinces, two provinces lagging behind in the HAT elimination effort. Our study population included current and former HAT patients, as well as healthcare providers and program managers of the national HAT control program. All interviews and discussions were voice recorded on a digital device and data were analysed with the ATLAS.ti software. Findings Health workers and community members quoted a number of prohibitions that have to be respected for six months after HAT treatment: no work, no sexual intercourse, no hot food, not walking in the sun. Violating these restrictions is believed to cause serious, and sometimes deadly, complications. These strong prohibitions are well-known by the community and lead some people to avoid HAT screening campaigns, for fear of having to observe such taboos in case of diagnosis. Discussion The restrictions originally aimed to mitigate the severe adverse effects of the melarsoprol regimen, but are not evidence-based and became obsolete with the new safer drugs. Correct health information regarding HAT treatment is essential. Health providers should address the perspective of the community in a constant dialogue to keep abreast of unintended transformations of meaning.","[Mpanya, Alain; Baloji, Sylvain; Lumbala, Crispin] Programme Natl Lutte Trypanosomiase Humaine Afric, Kinshasa, DEM REP CONGO; [Mpanya, Alain; Hendrickx, David; Boelaert, Marleen] Inst Trop Med, B-2000 Antwerp, Belgium; [Hendrickx, David] Univ Western Australia, Telethon Kids Inst, Perth, WA 6009, Australia; [Baloji, Sylvain] Univ Pedagog Natl, Kinshasa, DEM REP CONGO; [da Luz, Raquel Inocencio] Univ Antwerp, B-2020 Antwerp, Belgium; [Lutumba, Pascal] Inst Natl Rech Biomed, Kinshasa, DEM REP CONGO; [Lutumba, Pascal] Univ Kinshasa, Kinshasa, DEM REP CONGO","Mpanya, A (reprint author), Programme Natl Lutte Trypanosomiase Humaine Afric, Kinshasa, DEM REP CONGO.",mpanya_alain@yahoo.fr,"Inocencio da Luz, Raquel/L-9676-2016; Boelaert, Marleen/E-2698-2012","Inocencio da Luz, Raquel/0000-0002-2870-0311; Boelaert, Marleen/0000-0001-8051-6776","Institute of Tropical Medicine-Antwerp, Belgium through the Third Framework Agreement - Strategic Network on Neglected Diseases and Zoonoses","This study benefitted from the financial support of the Institute of Tropical Medicine-Antwerp, Belgium through a grant of the Third Framework Agreement - Strategic Network on Neglected Diseases and Zoonoses.

An early and accurate diagnosis of dengue can support clinical management, surveillance and disease control and is central to achieving the World Health Organisation target of a 50% reduction in dengue case mortality by 2020. Methods 5729 children with fever of <72hrs duration were enrolled into this multicenter prospective study in southern Vietnam between 2010-2012. A composite of gold standard diagnostic tests identified 1692 dengue cases. Using statistical methods, a novel Early Dengue Classifier (EDC) was developed that used patient age, white blood cell count and platelet count to discriminate dengue cases from non-dengue cases. Results The EDC had a sensitivity of 74.8% (95% CI: 73.0-76.8%) and specificity of 76.3%(95% CI: 75.2-77.6%) for the diagnosis of dengue. As an adjunctive test alongside NS1 rapid testing, sensitivity of the composite test was 91.6%(95% CI: 90.4-92.9%). Conclusions We demonstrate that the early diagnosis of dengue can be enhanced beyond the current standard of care using a simple evidence-based algorithm. The results should support patient management and clinical trials of specific therapies.","[Nguyen Minh Tuan; Nguyen Thanh Hung] Childrens Hosp 1, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam; [Ho Thi Nhan; Duong Thi Hue Kien; Tran Nguyen Bich Chau; Wills, Bridget; Wolbers, Marcel; Simmons, Cameron P.] Hosp Trop Dis, Oxford Univ Clin Res Unit, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam; [Nguyen Van Vinh Chau] Hosp Trop Dis, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam; [Ha Manh Tuan] Childrens Hosp 2, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam; [Ta Van Tram] Tien Giang Prov Hosp, My Tho, Tien Giang Prov, Vietnam; [Nguyen Le Da Ha] Dong Nai Childrens Hosp, Bien Hoa, Dong Nai Provin, Vietnam; [Phan Loi] Long An Prov Hosp, Tan An, Long An Provinc, Vietnam; [Han Khoi Quang] Binh Duong Prov Hosp, Thu Dau Mot, Binh Duong Prov, Vietnam; [Hubbard, Sonya; Simmons, Cameron P.] Univ Melbourne, Dept Microbiol & Immunol, Parkville, Vic 3052, Australia; [Wills, Bridget; Wolbers, Marcel; Simmons, Cameron P.] Univ Oxford, Nuffield Dept Med, Ctr Trop Med, Oxford, England; [Simmons, Cameron P.] Univ Melbourne, Nossal Inst Global Hlth, Parkville, Vic 3052, Australia","Tuan, NM (reprint author), Childrens Hosp 1, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam.",csimmons@unimelb.edu.au,,"Simmons, Cameron P./0000-0002-9039-7392",NHMRC [GNT006549]; Wellcome Trust [084368/Z/07/Z],"This study was supported by grants to CPS from the NHMRC GNT006549 and the Wellcome Trust 084368/Z/07/Z.

Since antibodies against trypanosome variant surface glycoproteins (VSG) are critically important for control of parasitemia, we hypothesized that Bam32 deficient (Bam32-/-) mice would be susceptible to T. congolense infection. Methodology/Principal Findings We found that T. congolense-infected Bam32(-/-) mice successfully control the first wave of parasitemia but then fail to control subsequent waves and ultimately succumb to their infection unlike wild type (WT) C57BL6 mice which are relatively resistant. Although infected Bam32(-/-) mice had significantly higher hepatomegaly and splenomegaly, their serum AST and ALT levels were not different, suggesting that increased liver pathology may not be responsible for the increased susceptibility of Bam32(-/-) mice to T. congolense. Using direct ex vivo flow cytometry and ELISA, we show that CD4+ T cells from infected Bam32(-/-) mice produced significantly increased amounts of disease-exacerbating proinflammatory cytokines (including IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha and IL-6). However, the percentages of regulatory T cells and IL-10-producing CD4+ cells were similar in infected WT and Bam32(-/-) mice. While serum levels of parasite-specific IgM antibodies were normal, the levels of parasite-specific IgG, (particularly IgG1 and IgG2a) were significantly lower in Bam32(-/-) mice throughout infection. This was associated with impaired germinal centre response in Bam32(-/-) mice despite increased numbers of T follicular helper (Tfh) cells. Adoptive transfer studies indicate that intrinsic B cell defect was responsible for the enhanced susceptibility of Bam32(-/-) mice to T. congolense infection. Conclusions/Significance Collectively, our data show that Bam32 is important for optimal anti-trypanosome IgG anti-body response and suppression of disease-promoting proinflammatory cytokines and its deficiency leads to inability to control T. congolense infection in mice.","[Onyilagha, Chukwunonso; Jia, Ping; Jayachandran, Nipun; Hou, Sen; Kuriakose, Shiby; Marshall, Aaron; Uzonna, Jude E.] Univ Manitoba, Fac Med, Dept Immunol, Winnipeg, MB R3E 0W3, Canada; [Okwor, Ifeoma; Uzonna, Jude E.] Univ Manitoba, Fac Med, Dept Med Microbiol, Winnipeg, MB R3E 0W3, Canada","Onyilagha, C (reprint author), Univ Manitoba, Fac Med, Dept Immunol, Winnipeg, MB R3E 0W3, Canada.",jude.uzonna@umanitoba.ca,,"Okwor, Ifeoma/0000-0003-0297-3589; Marshall, Aaron/0000-0002-1175-5498",Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada [RGPIN/288314],"This work was supported in part by The Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (www.nserc-crsng.gc.ca) Discovery Grant RGPIN/288314 to JEU.

Chronic disease may lead to a risk of carcinogenesis in the biliary ducts. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small noncoding RNAs that control gene expression at post-transcriptional level and are implicated in the regulation of various cellular processes during the parasite-host interplay. However, to date, the miRNAs of opisthorchiid flukes, in particular those essential for maintaining their complex biology and parasitic mode of existence, have not been satisfactorily described. Methodology/Principal Findings Using a SOLiD deep sequencing-bioinformatic approach, we identified 43 novel and 18 conserved miRNAs for O. felineus (miracidia, metacercariae and adult worms), 20 novel and 16 conserved miRNAs for O. viverrini (adult worms), and 33 novel and 18 conserved miRNAs for C. sinensis (adult worms). The analysis of the data revealed differences in the expression level of conserved miRNAs among the three species and among three the developmental stages of O. felineus. Analysis of miRNA genes revealed two gene clusters, one cluster-like region and one intronic miRNA in the genome. The presence and structure of the two gene clusters were validated using a PCR-based approach in the three flukes. Conclusions This study represents a comprehensive description of miRNAs in three members of the family Opistorchiidae, significantly expands our knowledge of miRNAs inmulticellular parasites and provides a basis for understanding the structural and functional evolution of miRNAs in these metazoan parasites. Results of this study also provides novel resources for deeper understanding the complex parasite biology, for further research on the pathogenesis and molecular events of disease induced by the liver flukes. The present data may also facilitate the development of novel approaches for the prevention and treatment of opisthorchiasis/clonorchiasis.","[Ovchinnikov, Vladimir Y.; Kashina, Elena V.; Mordvinov, Viacheslav A.; Katokhin, Alexey V.] Russian Acad Sci, Inst Cytol & Genet, Dept Human & Anim Genet, Novosibirsk 630090, Russia; [Afonnikov, Dmitry A.] Russian Acad Sci, Inst Cytol & Genet, Dept Syst Biol, Novosibirsk 630090, Russia; [Afonnikov, Dmitry A.; Katokhin, Alexey V.] Novosibirsk State Univ, Dept Nat Sci, Novosibirsk 630090, Russia; [Vasiliev, Gennady V.] Russian Acad Sci, Inst Cytol & Genet, Sect Genom Invest, Novosibirsk 630090, Russia; [Sripa, Banchob] Khon Kaen Univ, Fac Med, Dept Pathol, Khon Kaen, Thailand","Ovchinnikov, VY (reprint author), Russian Acad Sci, Inst Cytol & Genet, Dept Human & Anim Genet, Novosibirsk 630090, Russia.",tdkaliki@gmail.com,"Afonnikov, Dmitry/J-7806-2018; Mordvinov, Viatcheslav/S-8277-2017; Ovchinnikov, Vladimir/T-8932-2017; Vasiliev, Gennady/U-7686-2018; Ovchinnikov, Vladimir/P-6705-2019","Afonnikov, Dmitry/0000-0001-9738-1409; Mordvinov, Viatcheslav/0000-0002-6173-0774; Ovchinnikov, Vladimir/0000-0003-0350-8478; Ovchinnikov, Vladimir/0000-0003-0350-8478","Siberian Branch of the Russian Academy of Science [19]; State Project of ICG SB RAS [VI.60.1.1]; Russian Foundation for Basic Research (RFBR) [15-04-03551a]; Government of the Russian Federation [14.B25.31.0033, 220]; Russian Scientific Foundation [14-24-00123]","Financial support for this study was provided in part by Siberian Branch of the Russian Academy of Science Integration Project No19 (URLs of Siberian Branch of the Russian Academy of Science are http://www.sbras.ru and http://www.nsc.ru/en), State Project of ICG SB RAS VI.60.1.1, the Russian Foundation for Basic Research (RFBR # 15-04-03551a), and Project No14.B25.31.0033, Resolution No. 220 of the Government of the Russian Federation of April 9, 2010.

The signaling events triggered in the parasite upon binding to ECM are less explored and, to our knowledge, there is no data available regarding center dot NO signaling. Methodology/Principal Findings Trypomastigotes were incubated with ECM for different periods of time. Nitrated and S-nitrosylated proteins were analyzed by Western blotting using anti-nitrotyrosine and S-nitrosyl cysteine antibodies. At 2 h incubation time, a decrease in NO synthase activity, center dot NO, citrulline, arginine and cGMP concentrations, as well as the protein modifications levels have been observed in the parasite. The modified proteins were enriched by immunoprecipitation with anti-nitrotyrosine antibodies (nitrated proteins) or by the biotin switch method (S-nitrosylated proteins) and identified by MS/MS. The presence of both modifications was confirmed in proteins of interest by immunoblotting or immunoprecipitation. Conclusions/Significance For the first time it was shown that T. cruzi proteins are amenable to modifications by S-nitrosylation and nitration. When T. cruzi trypomastigotes are incubated with the extracellular matrix there is a general down regulation of these reactions, including a decrease in both NOS activity and cGMP concentration. Notwithstanding, some specific proteins, such as enolase or histones had, at least, their nitration levels increased. This suggests that post-translational modifications of T. cruzi proteins are not only a reflex of NOS activity, implying other mechanisms that circumvent a relatively low synthesis of center dot NO. In conclusion, the extracellular matrix, a cell surrounding layer of macromolecules that have to be trespassed by the parasite in order to be internalized into host cells, contributes to the modification of center dot NO signaling in the parasite, probably an essential move for the ensuing invasion step.","[Pereira, Milton; Soares, Chrislaine; Colli, Walter; Alves, Maria Julia M.] Univ Sao Paulo, Inst Quim, Dept Bioquim, BR-01498 Sao Paulo, Brazil; [Baptista Canuto, Gisele Andre; Maggi Tavares, Marina Franco] Univ Sao Paulo, Inst Quim, Dept Quim Fundamental, Sao Paulo, Brazil","Pereira, M (reprint author), Univ Cambridge, Dept Vet Med, Cambridge, England.",mjmalves@iq.usp.br,"Colli, Walter/G-1188-2012; Alves, Maria Julia/K-8976-2012; Canuto, Gisele A B/N-7338-2015","Alves, Maria Julia/0000-0001-7211-9631; Canuto, Gisele A B/0000-0002-6616-3705; Pereira, Milton/0000-0003-2977-1565; Colli, Walter/0000-0001-7305-4673","Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo [2012/50188-3, 2012/03887-3, 2012/05621-0]; Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico","The work was supported by Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo (http://www.fapesp.br/), grant numbers 2012/50188-3, 2012/03887-3 and 2012/05621-0) and by Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (http://www.cnpq.br/).

Ecological and socioeconomic factors associated with these urban transitions create conditions for the potential transmission of infectious diseases, which was demonstrated for Chagas disease. Methodology/Principal Findings We analyzed 930 triatomines, mainly Triatoma tibiamaculata, collected in artificial and sylvatic environments (forests near houses) of a suburban area of the city of Salvador, Bahia State, Brazil between 2007 and 2011. Most triatomines were captured at peridomiciles. Adult bugs predominated in all studied environments, and nymphs were scarce inside houses. Molecular analyses of a randomly selected sub-sample (n=212) of triatomines showed Trypanosoma cruzi infection rates of 65%, 50% and 56% in intradomestic, peridomestic and sylvatic environments, respectively. We detected the T. cruzi lineages I and II and mixed infections. We also showed that T. tibiamaculata fed on blood from birds (50%), marsupials (38%), ruminants (7%) and rodents (5%). The probability of T. cruzi infection was higher in triatomines that fed on marsupial blood (odds ratio (OR)=1.95, 95% confidence interval (CI)=1.22-3.11). Moreover, we observed a protective effect against infection in bugs that fed on bird blood (OR=0.43, 95% CI=0.30-0.73). Conclusions/Significance The frequent invasion of houses by infected triatomines indicates a potential risk of T. cruzi transmission to inhabitants in this area. Our results reinforce that continuous epidemiological surveillance should be performed in areas where domestic transmission is controlled but enzootic transmission persists.","[Ribeiro, Gilmar, Jr.; Reis, Renato Barbosa; Silva dos Santos, Carlos Gustavo; Amorim, Alekhine; Reis, Mitermayer G.] FIOCRUZ BA, Ctr Pesquisas Goncalo Moniz, Lab Patol & Biol Mol, Salvador, BA, Brazil; [Ribeiro, Gilmar, Jr.] Fac Ruy Barbosa DeVry, Salvador, BA, Brazil; [Gurgel-Goncalves, Rodrigo] Univ Brasilia, Lab Parasitol Med & Biol Vetores, Brasilia, DF, Brazil; [Reis, Renato Barbosa] Univ Salvador, Unifacs, Programa Pos Grad Desenvolvimento Reg & Urbano PP, Salvador, BA, Brazil; [Silva dos Santos, Carlos Gustavo] Secretaria Saude, Lab Cent Saude Publ Estado Bahia, Lab Entomol, Salvador, BA, Brazil; [Andrade, Sonia Gumes] FIOCRUZ BA, Lab Doenca Chagas Expt Autoimunidade & Imunol Cel, Salvador, BA, Brazil","Ribeiro, G (reprint author), FIOCRUZ BA, Ctr Pesquisas Goncalo Moniz, Lab Patol & Biol Mol, Salvador, BA, Brazil.",miter@bahia.fiocruz.br,,,"Oswaldo Cruz Foundation (CpqGM-FIOCRUZ/BA); Brazilian Council for Scientific and Technology Development (CNPq) [477552/2010-2, 14/2010]","This study was supported by Oswaldo Cruz Foundation (CpqGM-FIOCRUZ/BA) and by the Brazilian Council for Scientific and Technology Development (CNPq) (www.cnpq.br) via grant 477552/2010-2 trought Universal Edital / Edital MCT/ CNPq 14/2010.

Molecular evidence suggests spread has been almost exclusively through human-to-human contact. Social factors are thus clearly important to understand the epidemic and ways in which it might be stopped, but these factors have so far been little analyzed. The present paper focuses on Sierra Leone, and provides cross sectional data on the least understood part of the epidemic-the largely undocumented spread of Ebola in rural areas. Various forms of social networking in rural communities and their relevance for understanding pathways of transmission are described. Particular attention is paid to the relationship between marriage, funerals and land tenure. Funerals are known to be a high-risk factor for infection. It is suggested that more than a shift in awareness of risks will be needed to change local patterns of behavior, especially in regard to funerals, since these are central to the consolidation of community ties. A concluding discussion relates the information presented to plans for halting the disease. Local consultation and access are seen as major challenges to be addressed.","[Richards, Paul; Amara, Joseph; Kamara, Prince; Mokuwa, Esther; Sheriff, Amara Idara; Suluku, Roland] Njala Univ, Sch Environm Sci, Njala, Sierra Leone; [Ferme, Mariane C.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Anthropol, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Voors, Maarten] Wageningen Univ, Dev Econ Grp, NL-6700 AP Wageningen, Netherlands; [Voors, Maarten] Univ Cambridge, Dept Land Econ, Cambridge CB3 9EP, England","Richards, P (reprint author), Njala Univ, Sch Environm Sci, Njala Univ Campus, Njala, Sierra Leone.",paul.richards@wur.nl,,"Richards, Paul/0000-0001-5813-0228; Voors, Maarten/0000-0001-5907-3253",International Initiative for Impact Evaluation (3ie) through the Global Development Network (GDN) [TW1.1042]; UK Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) [ES/J017620/1]; National Science Foundation [1430959]; FAO; Irish Aid funs; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/J017620/1],"This work was funded by the International Initiative for Impact Evaluation (3ie) through the Global Development Network (GDN) grant #TW1.1042 to MV and PR, http://www.3ieimpact.org/en/ UK Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) grant # ES/J017620/1 to MV and PR, http://www.esrc.ac.uk/ National Science Foundation, grant # 1430959 to MF, http://www.nsf.gov/ FAO and Irish Aid funs to EM and PR, http://www.fao.org/home/en/, https://www.irishaid.ie/.

Current therapies are inadequate because of their severe host toxicity and numerous side effects. The identification of new biotargets is essential for the development of more efficient therapeutic alternatives. Inhibition of sirtuins from Trypanosoma brucei and Leishmania ssp. showed promising results, indicating that these enzymes may be considered as targets for drug discovery in parasite infection. Here, we report the first characterization of the two sirtuins present in T. cruzi. Methodology Dm28c epimastigotes that inducibly overexpress TcSIR2RP1 and TcSIR2RP3 were constructed and used to determine their localizations and functions. These transfected lines were tested regarding their acetylation levels, proliferation and metacyclogenesis rate, viability when treated with sirtuin inhibitors and in vitro infectivity. Conclusion TcSIR2RP1 and TcSIR2RP3 are cytosolic and mitochondrial proteins respectively. Our data suggest that sirtuin activity is important for the proliferation of T. cruzi replicative forms, for the host cell-parasite interplay, and for differentiation among life-cycle stages; but each one performs different roles in most of these processes. Our results increase the knowledge on the localization and function of these enzymes, and the overexpressing T. cruzi strains we obtained can be useful tools for experimental screening of trypanosomatid sirtuin inhibitors.","[Ritagliati, Carla; Alonso, Victoria L.; Cribb, Pamela; Serra, Esteban C.] Consejo Nacl Invest Cient & Tecn, Inst Biol Mol & Celular Rosario IBR, Rosario, Santa Fe, Argentina; [Alonso, Victoria L.; Manarin, Romina; Cribb, Pamela; Serra, Esteban C.] Univ Nacl Rosario, Fac Ciencias Bioquim & Farmaceut, RA-2000 Rosario, Santa Fe, Argentina","Ritagliati, C (reprint author), Consejo Nacl Invest Cient & Tecn, Inst Biol Mol & Celular Rosario IBR, Rosario, Santa Fe, Argentina.",eserra@fbioyf.unr.edu.ar,,"Cribb, Pamela/0000-0001-6973-4019; Alonso, Victoria Lucia/0000-0001-9518-8576",Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas (CONICET) [PIP2010 0685],"This work was funded by PIP2010 0685 Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas (CONICET) www.conicet.gov.ar to ECS.

The bacteria colonize the renal proximal tubules of many animals and are shed in the urine. Contact with the urine, or with water contaminated with the urine of infected animals can cause infection of new host animals, including humans. Mechanisms of colonization of the proximal tubule and other tissues are not known, but specific interactions between bacterial adhesins and host substrates are likely to be critical in this process. Several extracellular matrix (ECM) adhesins have been previously identified, but more recently, it has been shown that Leptospira bind more efficiently to cells than ECM. In this work, recombinant forms of five putative Leptospira ECM adhesins, namely LipL32, Loa22, OmpL1, p31/LipL45, and LenA were evaluated for binding to cells as well as an expanded variety of ECM components. Reproducible and significant adhesin activity was demonstrated only for OmpL1, which bound to both mammalian cell lines tested and to glycosaminoglycans (GAGs). While determination of biologically significant bacterial adhesion activity will require generation of site-directed mutant strains, our results suggest that OmpL1 is a strong candidate for future evaluation regarding the roles of the adhesin activity of the protein during L. interrogans infection.","[Robbins, Gregory T.; Aranda, Patrick S.] Med Coll Wisconsin, Milwaukee, WI 53226 USA; [Hahn, Beth L.; Padmore, Lavinia; Coburn, Jenifer] Med Coll Wisconsin, Dept Med, Div Infect Dis, Milwaukee, WI 53226 USA; [Evangelista, Karen V.; Coburn, Jenifer] Med Coll Wisconsin, Grad Program Microbiol Immunol & Mol Genet, Milwaukee, WI 53226 USA","Robbins, GT (reprint author), Med Coll Wisconsin, Milwaukee, WI 53226 USA.",jcoburn@mcw.edu,,,"National Institutes of Health/National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases; Department of Medicine, Medical College of Wisconsin; Center for Infectious Disease Research, Medical College of Wisconsin","This work was funded by: National Institutes of Health/National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (JC). http://www.niaid.nih.gov/Pages/default.aspx, and Department of Medicine and Center for Infectious Disease Research, Medical College of Wisconsin (JC). http://www.mcw.edu/medicine.htm http://www.mcw.edu/CenterforInfectiousDiseaseResearch.htm.

In response, countries have developed a wide range of disease surveillance systems enabled by technological advancements. The heterogeneity and complexity of country data systems have caused a growing need for international organizations such as the World Health Organization (WHO) to coordinate the standardization, integration, and dissemination of country disease data at the global level for research and policy. The availability and consistency of currently available disease surveillance data at the global level are unclear. We investigated this for dengue surveillance data provided online by the WHO. Methods and Findings We extracted all dengue surveillance data provided online by WHO Headquarters and Regional Offices (RO's). We assessed the availability and consistency of these data by comparing indicators within and between sources. We also assessed the consistency of dengue data provided online by two example countries (Brazil and Indonesia). Data were available from WHO for 100 countries since 1955 representing a total of 23 million dengue cases and 82 thousand deaths ever reported to WHO. The availability of data on Dengue-Net and some RO's declined dramatically after 2005. Consistency was lacking between sources (84% across all indicators representing a discrepancy of almost half a million cases). Within sources, data at high spatial resolution were often incomplete. Conclusions The decline of publicly available, integrated dengue surveillance data at the global level will limit opportunities for research, policy, and advocacy. A new financial and operational framework will be necessary for innovation and for the continued availability of integrated country disease data at the global level.","[Ruberto, Irene; Burke, Donald S.; Van Panhuis, Willem G.] Univ Pittsburgh, Grad Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Epidemiol, Pittsburgh, PA 15260 USA; [Marques, Ernesto] Univ Pittsburgh, Ctr Vaccine Res, Pittsburgh, PA USA","Ruberto, I (reprint author), Univ Pittsburgh, Grad Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Epidemiol, Pittsburgh, PA 15260 USA.",wav10@pitt.edu,"Marques, Ernesto/L-4967-2013; Van Panhuis, Willem/S-5495-2019","Marques, Ernesto/0000-0003-3826-9358; Van Panhuis, Willem/0000-0002-7278-9982; /0000-0002-5704-8094",Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation [49276]; US National Institute of General Medical Sciences [5U54GM088491],"The contributions of IR, WGVP, and DSB to this study were supported by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation (Grant 49276, Evaluation of Candidate Vaccine Technologies Using Computational Models) and the US National Institute of General Medical Sciences (Grant 5U54GM088491, Computational Models of Infectious Disease Threats).

There are conflicting findings on potential association between these two parasites. This study investigated the Plasmodium and helminth co-infections among children aged 2 months to 9 years living in Bagamoyo district, coastal region of Tanzania. Methods A community-based cross-sectional survey was conducted among 1033 children. Stool, urine and blood samples were examined using a broad set of quality controlled diagnostic methods for common STH (Ascaris lumbricoides, hookworm, Strongyloides stercoralis, Enterobius vermicularis, Trichuris trichura), schistosoma species and Wuchereria bancrofti. Blood slides and malaria rapid diagnostic tests (mRDTs) were utilized for Plasmodium diagnosis. Results Out of 992 children analyzed, the prevalence of Plasmodium infection was 13% (130/992), helminth 28.5%(283/992); 5% (50/992) had co-infection with Plasmodium and helminth. The prevalence rate of Plasmodium, specific STH and co-infections increased significantly with age (p < 0.001), with older children mostly affected except for S. stercoralis monoinfection and co-infections. Spatial variations of co-infection prevalence were observed between and within villages. There was a trend for STH infections to be associated with Plasmodium infection [OR adjusted for age group 1.4, 95% CI (1.0-2.1)], which was more marked for S. stercoralis (OR = 2.2, 95% CI (1.1-4.3). Age and not schooling were risk factors for Plasmodium and STH co-infection. Conclusion The findings suggest that STH and Plasmodium infections tend to occur in the same children, with increasing prevalence of co-infection with age. This calls for an integrated approach such as using mass chemotherapy with dual effect (e.g., ivermectin) coupled with improved housing, sanitation and hygiene for the control of both parasitic infections.","[Salim, Nahya; Lweno, Omar; Abdul, Ummi; Mohamed, Ali; Schindler, Tobias; Rothen, Julian; Masimba, John; Kwaba, Denis; Mohammed, Alisa S.; Abdulla, Salim] Ifakara Hlth Inst, Bagamoyo Res & Training Ctr, Bagamoyo, Tanzania; [Salim, Nahya] Muhimbili Univ Hlth & Allied Sci, Dept Pediat & Child Hlth, Dar Es Salaam, Tanzania; [Salim, Nahya; Knopp, Stefanie; Althaus, Fabrice; Tanner, Marcel; Genton, Blaise] Swiss Trop & Publ Hlth Inst, Dept Epidemiol & Publ Hlth, Basel, Switzerland; [Salim, Nahya; Knopp, Stefanie; Schindler, Tobias; Rothen, Julian; Tanner, Marcel; Daubenberger, Claudia; Genton, Blaise] Univ Basel, Basel, Switzerland; [Knopp, Stefanie] Nat Hist Museum, Wolfson Wellcome Biomed Labs, Dept Life Sci, London SW7 5BD, England; [Schindler, Tobias; Rothen, Julian; Daubenberger, Claudia] Swiss Trop & Publ Hlth Inst, Dept Med Parasitol & Infect Biol, Basel, Switzerland; [Genton, Blaise] Univ Lausanne Hosp, Infect Dis Serv, Dept Ambulatory Care & Community Med, Lausanne, Switzerland","Salim, N (reprint author), Ifakara Hlth Inst, Bagamoyo Res & Training Ctr, Bagamoyo, Tanzania.",nsalim@ihi.or.tz,,"masoud, nahya salim/0000-0002-3784-6478; Knopp, Stefanie/0000-0001-5707-7963; Rothen, Julian/0000-0003-0770-1689; Schindler, Tobias/0000-0002-5961-095X",European Commission in the frame of the IDEA project "Dissecting the Immunological Interplay between Poverty Related Diseases and Helminth infections: An African-European Research Initiative."

In response, the Australian Government has recently invested heavily towards the nationwide control of the disease. Methodology/Principal Findings A novel simulation model was developed to reflect the trachoma epidemic in Australian Aboriginal communities. The model, which incorporates demographic, migration, mixing, and biological heterogeneities, was used to evaluate recent intervention measures against counterfactual past scenarios, and also to assess the potential impact of a series of hypothesized future intervention measures relative to the current national strategy and intensity. The model simulations indicate that, under the current intervention strategy and intensity, the likelihood of controlling trachoma to less than 5% prevalence among 5-9 year-old children in hyperendemic communities by 2020 is 31% (19%-43%). By shifting intervention priorities such that large increases in the facial cleanliness of children are observed, this likelihood of controlling trachoma in hyperendemic communities is increased to 64% (53%-76%). The most effective intervention strategy incorporated large-scale antibiotic distribution programs whilst attaining ambitious yet feasible screening, treatment, facial cleanliness and housing construction targets. Accordingly, the estimated likelihood of controlling trachoma in these communities is increased to 86% (76%-95%). Conclusions/Significance Maintaining the current intervention strategy and intensity is unlikely to be sufficient to control trachoma across Australia by 2020. However, by shifting the intervention strategy and increasing intensity, the likelihood of controlling trachoma nationwide can be significantly increased.","[Shattock, Andrew J.; Cowling, Carleigh S.; Kaldor, John M.; Wilson, David P.] Univ New S Wales, Kirby Inst, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Gambhir, Manoj] Monash Univ, Dept Epidemiol & Prevent Med, Melbourne, Vic 3004, Australia; [Taylor, Hugh R.] Univ Melbourne, Melbourne Sch Populat Hlth, Melbourne, Vic, Australia","Shattock, AJ (reprint author), Univ New S Wales, Kirby Inst, Sydney, NSW, Australia.",dwilson@unsw.edu.au,,"Shattock, Andrew/0000-0002-2285-8425; Gambhir, Manoj/0000-0002-4831-6261; Taylor, Hugh/0000-0002-9437-784X","Australian Government Department of Health and Ageing; Australian Research Council; National Health and Medical Research Council; Australian Government, Department of Health and Ageing","This study was funded by the Australian Government Department of Health and Ageing with the intention of using the work to inform best practice towards elimination by 2020.

There is not currently a vaccine available against HFMD, even though a newly developed formalin-inactivated EV71 (FI-EV71) vaccine has been tested in clinical trial and has shown efficacy against EV71. We have designed and genetically engineered a recombinant adenovirus Ad-EVVLP with the EV71 P1 and 3CD genes inserted into the E1/E3-deleted adenoviral genome. Ad-EVVLP were produced in HEK-293A cells. In addition to Ad-EVVLP particles, virus-like particles (VLPs) formed from the physical association of EV71 capsid proteins, VP0, VP1, and VP3 expressed from P1 gene products. They were digested by 3CD protease and confirmed to be produced by Ad-EVVLP-producing cells, as determined using transmission electron microscopy and western blotting. Mouse immunogenicity studies showed that Ad-EVVLP-immunized antisera neutralized the EV71 B4 and C2 genotypes. Activation of VLP-specific CD4(+) and CD8(+)/IFN-gamma T cells associated with Th1/Th2-balanced IFN-gamma, IL-17, IL-4, and IL-13 was induced; in contrast, FI-EV71 induced only Th2-mediated neutralizing antibody against EV71 and low VLP-specific CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cell responses. The antiviral immunity against EV71 was clearly demonstrated in mice vaccinated with Ad-EVVLP in a hSCARB2 transgenic (hSCARB2-Tg) mouse challenge model. Ad-EVVLP-vaccinated mice were 100% protected and demonstrated reduced viral load in both the CNS and muscle tissues. Ad-EVVLP successfully induced anti-CVA16 immunities. Although antisera had no neutralizing activity against CVA16, the 3C-specific CD4(+) and CD8(+)/IFN-gamma T cells were identified, which could mediate protection against CVA16 challenge. FI-EV71 did not induce 3C-mediated immunity and had no efficacy against the CVA16 challenge. These results suggest that Ad-EVVLP can enhance neutralizing antibody and protective cellular immune responses to prevent EV71 infection and cellular immune responses against CV infection.","[Tsou, Yueh-Liang; Lin, Yi-Wen; Shao, Hsiao-Yun; Yu, Shu-Ling; Lin, Hsiao-Yu; Liu, Chia-Chyi; Huang, Chieh; Chong, Pele; Chow, Yen-Hung] Natl Hlth Res Inst, Inst Infect Dis & Vaccinol, Zhunan, Taiwan; [Tsou, Yueh-Liang; Shao, Hsiao-Yun] Natl Tsing Hua Univ, Inst Mol & Cellular Biol, Grad Program Biotechnol Med, Hsinchu, Taiwan; [Wu, Shang-Rung] Natl Cheng Kung Univ, Coll Med & Hosp, Inst Oral Med, Tainan 70101, Taiwan; [Chong, Pele; Chow, Yen-Hung] China Med Univ, Grad Inst Immunol, Taichung, Taiwan","Tsou, YL (reprint author), Natl Hlth Res Inst, Inst Infect Dis & Vaccinol, Zhunan, Taiwan.",choeyenh@nhri.org.tw,"Liu, Chia-Chyi/A-8215-2012; Ibrahim, Essam H./G-1960-2018","Liu, Chia-Chyi/0000-0002-6257-0389; Ibrahim, Essam H./0000-0003-0130-2257",National Health Research Institutes [IV-103-PP-28]; Ministry of Science and Technology [MOST 103-2311-B-400-004-MY3],"This work was funded by the National Health Research Institutes' intramural funding (IV-103-PP-28, http://www.nhri.org.tw), and the Ministry of Science and Technology's funding (MOST 103-2311-B-400-004-MY3, http://www.most.gov.tw/mp.aspx).

It is characterized by a triad of painless subcutaneous mass, multiple sinuses and discharge containing grains. Mycetoma commonly affects young men aged between 20 and 40 years with low socioeconomic status, particularly farmers and herdsmen. Methodology / Principal Findings A 30 year-old male farmer from an ethnic minority in Phin District, Savannakhet Province, Lao PDR (Laos) developed a painless swelling with multiple draining sinuses of his right foot over a period of approximately 3 years. X-ray of the right foot showed osteolysis of tarsals and metatarsals. Aerobic culture of sinus discharge yielded large numbers of Staphylococcus aureus and a slow growing Gram-positive rod. The organism was subsequently identified as Nocardia aobensis by 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing. The patient received antimicrobial treatment with amikacin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole according to consensus treatment guidelines. Although slight improvement was noted the patient left the hospital after 14 days and did not take any more antibiotics. Over the following 22 weeks the swelling of his foot subsequently diminished together with healing of discharging sinuses. Conclusion This is the first published case of Actinomycetoma caused by Nocardia aobensis and the second case of Actinomycetoma from Laos. A treatment course of only 14 days with amikacin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole was apparently sufficient to cure the infection, although long-term treatment up to one year is currently recommended. Treatment trials or prospective descriptions of outcome for actinomycetoma should investigate treatment efficacy for the different members of Actinomycetales, particularly Nocardia spp., with short-term and long-term treatment courses.","[Vongphoumy, Inthanomchanh; Blessmann, Joerg] Prov Hlth Dept, Savannakhet, Laos; [Dance, David A.

Reported here are findings from a series of in vitro studies that investigated the plasticity and heritability of spatial repellent (SR) behaviors in Aedes aegypti exposed to airborne transfluthrin, including results that indicate a possible link between repellent insensitivity and insecticide resistance. Methodology/principal findings A dual-choice chamber system was used to observe directional flight behaviors in Aedes aegypti mosquitoes exposed to passively emanating transfluthrin vapors (1.35 mg/m(3)). Individual SR responder and SR non-responder mosquitoes were identified, collected and maintained separately according to their observed phenotype. Subsequent testing included re-evaluation of behavioral responses in some mosquito cohorts as well as testing the progeny of selectively bred responder and non-responder mosquito strains through nine generations. At baseline (F-0 generation), transfluthrin actively repelled mosquitoes in the assay system. F-0 mosquitoes repelled upon initial exposure to transfluthrin vapors were no more likely to be repelled again by subsequent exposure 24h later, but repelled mosquitoes allowed to rest for 48h were subsequently repelled at a higher proportion than was observed at baseline. Selective breeding of SR responders for nine generations did not change the proportion of mosquitoes repelled in any generation. However, selective breeding of SR non-responders did produce, after four generations, a strain of mosquitoes that was insensitive to the SR activity of transfluthrin. Compared to the SR responder strain, the SR insensitive strain also demonstrated decreased susceptibility to transfluthrin toxicity in CDC bottle bioassays and a higher frequency of the V1016I(kdr) mutation. Conclusions/significance SR responses to volatile transfluthrin are complex behaviors with multiple determinants in Ae. aegypti. Results indicate a role for neurotoxic irritation of mosquitoes by sub-lethal doses of airborne chemical as a mechanism by which transfluthrin can produce SR behaviors in mosquitoes. Accordingly, how prolonged exposure to sub-lethal doses of volatile pyrethroids might impact insecticide resistance in natural vector populations, and how already resistant populations might respond to a given repellent in the field, are important considerations that warrant further monitoring and study. Results also highlight the critical need to develop new repellent active ingredients with novel mechanisms of action.","[Wagman, Joseph M.] Uniformed Serv Univ Hlth Sci, Dept Prevent Med & Biometr, Div Trop Publ Hlth, Bethesda, MD 20814 USA; [Achee, Nicole L.; Grieco, John P.] Univ Notre Dame, Coll Biol Sci, Eck Inst Global Hlth, Notre Dame, IN 46556 USA","Wagman, JM (reprint author), Uniformed Serv Univ Hlth Sci, Dept Prevent Med & Biometr, Div Trop Publ Hlth, Bethesda, MD 20814 USA.",joseph.m.wagman@gmail.com,,,"Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences [RO8701, PMB872207]","NLA (Grant# RO8701) and JMW (Grant# PMB872207) received funding for this work from the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences.

It is expected to spread in the future to Europe and has recently reached the USA due to globalization, climate change and vector switch. Despite this, little is known about the virus life cycle and, so far, there is no specific treatment or vaccination against Chikungunya infections. We aimed here to identify small antigenic determinants of the CHIKV E2 protein able to induce neutralizing immune responses. Methodology/Principal Findings E2 enables attachment of the virus to target cells and a humoral immune response against E2 should protect from CHIKV infections. Seven recombinant proteins derived from E2 and consisting of linear and/or structural antigens were created, and were expressed in and purified from E. coli. BALB/c mice were vaccinated with these recombinant proteins and the mouse sera were screened for neutralizing antibodies. Whereas a linear N-terminally exposed peptide (L) and surface-exposed parts of the E2 domain A (sA) alone did not induce neutralizing antibodies, a construct containing domain B and a part of the beta-ribbon (called B +) was sufficient to induce neutralizing antibodies. Furthermore, domain sA fused to B+ (sAB+) induced the highest amount of neutralizing antibodies. Therefore, the construct sAB + was used to generate a recombinant modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA), MVA-CHIKV-sAB+. Mice were vaccinated with MVA-CHIKV-sAB+ and/or the recombinant protein sAB+ and were subsequently challenged with wild-type CHIKV. Whereas four vaccinations with MVA-CHIKV-sAB+ were not sufficient to protect mice from a CHIKV infection, protein vaccination with sAB+ markedly reduced the viral titers of vaccinated mice. Conclusions/Significance The recombinant protein sAB+ contains important structural antigens for a neutralizing antibody response in mice and its formulation with appropriate adjuvants might lead to a future CHIKV vaccine.","[Weber, Christopher; Buechner, Sarah M.; Schnierle, Barbara S.] Paul Ehrlich Inst, Dept Virol, Langen, Germany","Weber, C (reprint author), Paul Ehrlich Inst, Dept Virol, Langen, Germany.",Barbara.Schnierle@pei.de,,,Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft [Graduiertenschule GRK 1172],"CW was supported by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (Graduiertenschule GRK 1172).

Although HTLV screening of blood donors was already routinely performed in developed countries, little is know about the HTLV prevalence among blood donors in developing countries which do not perform HTLV screening, such as China. Objectives & Aims To systematically characterize the prevalence of HTLV infection among bloods in southeast China. Methods A 10-year survey for HTLV prevalence in blood donors was performed in Xiamen, southeast China, during 2004-2013. The HTLV-1/2 of blood donations were screened by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, following with confirmation by western blot assay and 9nucleic acid testing. The HTLV-1 prevalences in donors from different cities were calculated. Viral sequences derived from identified HTLV-positive cases were sequenced and analyzed. Results Among 253,855 blood donors, 43 were confirmed to be seropositive for HTLV-1 (16.9 per 100,000 95% CI: 12.3-22.8) and none HTLV-2 infection was found. The HTLV-1 prevalence varied significantly in donors from different cities. Donors from cities in Fujian province (24.3 per 100,000, 95% CI: 17.4-33.1) had a significantly higher (p=0.001) HTLV-1 seroprevalence than those who were born in non-Fujian cities (3.4 per 100,000, 95% CI: 0.7-9.8). Among nine cities in Fujian province, the highest prevalence was found in blood donors from Ningde (171.3 per 100,000, 95% CI: 91.3-292.8) which is a coastal city in the northeast of Fujian. Molecular characterization of viral sequences from 27 HTLV-1 carriers revealed 25 were Transcontinental subtype of genotype A and 2 were Japanese subtype of genotype A. Interestingly, 12 of 25 Transcontinental subtype sequences harbored a characteristic L55P mutation in viral gp46 protein, which was only presented in the Transcontinental subtype sequences from Japan and Taiwan but not in that from other countries. Conclusions Although China is considered to be a non-endemic region for HTLV, the HTLV-1 prevalence in blood donors is significantly higher in Fujian province, southeast China. A higher prevalence of HTLV-1 in the Fujian may be attributed to endemic foci in the city of Ningde.","[Xie, Jinzhen; Zhang, Yali; Lin, Yongcai; Ni, Hongying; Chen, Changrong] Xiamen Blood Serv, Xiamen, Peoples R China; [Xie, Jinzhen; Ge, Shengxiang; Zhang, Yali; Lin, Yongcai; Ni, Hongying; Zhang, Jun; Chen, Changrong] State Key Lab Mol Vaccinol & Mol Diagnost, Xiamen, Peoples R China; [Ge, Shengxiang; Zhang, Jun] Natl Inst Diagnost & Vaccine Dev Infect Dis, Xiamen, Peoples R China; [Ge, Shengxiang; Zhang, Jun] Collaborat Innovat Ctr Biol Prod, Xiamen, Peoples R China; [Ge, Shengxiang; Zhang, Jun] Xiamen Univ, Sch Publ Hlth, Xiamen, Peoples R China","Xie, JZ (reprint author), Xiamen Blood Serv, Xiamen, Peoples R China.",ccr1969@163.com,"Ge, Shengxiang/Q-2256-2019; Ge, SX/G-4693-2010","Ge, Shengxiang/0000-0002-7165-3004; ","Key Blood Transfusion Medical Specialist Programs of Xiamen, China; 12th Five-year National Science & Technology Major Project [2012ZX10004702]; Ministry of Science and Technology of the People's Republic of China","This work was supported by the Key Blood Transfusion Medical Specialist Programs of Xiamen, China(2012-2014) and the 12th Five-year National Science & Technology Major Project (No. 2012ZX10004702) sponsored by Ministry of Science and Technology of the People's Republic of China.

The present work aimed to assess the utility of the loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) for detection of light intensity infection or false-negative patients and patients post-treatment, targeting the highly repetitive retrotransposon SjR2 of Schistosoma japonicum. Methodology/Principal Findings LAMP was first assessed in rabbits with low intensity infection (EPG<10). Then 110 patient sera from Hunan Province, China, and 47 sera after treatment by praziquantel were used to evaluate the diagnostic validity of LAMP. Meanwhile, 42 sera from healthy individuals in a non-endemic area, and 60 sera from ""healthy"" residents who were identified as being negative for feces examination and immuno-methods in an endemic area were also examined. The results showed that LAMP could detect S. japonicum DNA in sera from rabbits at 3rd day post-infection. Following administration of praziquantel, the S. japonicum DNA in rabbit sera became negative at 10 weeks post-treatment. Of 110 sera from patients, LAMP showed 95.5% sensitivity, and even for 41 patients with less than 10 EPG, the sensitivity of LAMP still reached to 95.1%. For 47 patients after treatment, the negative conversion rate of S. japonicum DNA in patient sera increased from 23.4%, 61.7% to 83.0% at 3 months, 6 months and 9 months post-treatment, respectively. No false-positive result was obtained for 42 human sera from non-endemic area, while for the 60 ""healthy"" individuals from endemic area, 10 (16.7%) individuals were positive by LAMP, which suggested that these individuals might be false-negative patients. Conclusions/Significance The present study demonstrated that the LAMP assay is sensitive, specific, and affordable, which would help reduce schistosomiasis transmission through targeted treatment of individuals, particularly for those with negative stool examinations who may yet remain infected. The LAMP assay may provide a potential tool to support schistosomiasis control and elimination strategies.","[Xu, Jing; Guan, Zhi-Xun; Zhao, Bo; Wang, Yan-Yan; Cao, Yun; Zhang, Hui-Qin; Xia, Chao-Ming] Soochow Univ, Coll Med, Dept Parasitol, Suzhou, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Zhu, Xing-Quan] Chinese Acad Agr Sci, Lanzhou Vet Res Inst, Key Lab Vet Parasitol Gansu Prov, State Key Lab Vet Etiol Biol, Lanzhou, Gansu, Peoples R China; [He, Yong-Kang] Hunan Prov Inst Schistosomiasis Control, Yueyang, Hunan, Peoples R China","Xu, J (reprint author), Soochow Univ, Coll Med, Dept Parasitol, Suzhou, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",xiachaoming@suda.edu.cn,,,Priority Academic Program Development of Jiangsu Higher Education Institution [YX13400214]; National Basic Research Program of China(973 Program) [2007CB513100]; Key Laboratory of Control and Prevention of Parasitic Disease of Healthy Ministry [wk014-001],"This study was funded by A Project Funded by the Priority Academic Program Development of Jiangsu Higher Education Institution (No. YX13400214); the National Basic Research Program of China(973 Program, Grant No. 2007CB513100); Key Laboratory of Control and Prevention of Parasitic Disease of Healthy Ministry, No. wk014-001).

Herein, we have tested the protective efficacy of a DNA-prime/T. rangeli-boost (TcVac4) vaccine in a dog (Canis familiaris) model. Dogs were immunized with two-doses of DNA vaccine (pcDNA3.1 encoding TcG1, TcG2, and TcG4 antigens plus IL-12- and GM-CSF-encoding plasmids) followed by two doses of glutaraldehyde-inactivated T. rangeli epimastigotes (TrIE); and challenged with highly pathogenic T. cruzi (SylvioX10/4) isolate. Dogs given TrIE or empty pcDNA3.1 were used as controls. We monitored post-vaccination and post-challenge infection antibody response by an ELISA, parasitemia by blood analysis and xenodiagnosis, and heart function by electrocardiography. Post-mortem anatomic and pathologic evaluation of the heart was conducted. TcVac4 induced a strong IgG response (IgG2>IgG1) that was significantly expanded post-infection, and moved to a nearly balanced IgG2/IgG1 response in chronic phase. In comparison, dogs given TrIE or empty plasmid DNA only developed high IgG titers with IgG2 predominance in response to T. cruzi infection. Blood parasitemia, tissue parasite foci, parasite transmission to triatomines, electrocardiographic abnormalities were significantly lower in TcVac4-vaccinated dogs than was observed in dogs given TrIE or empty plasmid DNA only. Macroscopic and microscopic alterations, the hallmarks of chronic Chagas disease, were significantly decreased in the myocardium of TcVac4-vaccinated dogs. We conclude that TcVac4 induced immunity was beneficial in providing resistance to T. cruzi infection, evidenced by control of chronic pathology of the heart and preservation of cardiac function in dogs. Additionally, TcVac4 vaccination decreased the transmission of parasites from vaccinated/infected animals to triatomines.","[Aparicio-Burgos, Jose E.] Univ Autonoma Estado Hidalgo, Escuela Super Apan, Apan Hidalgo, Mexico; [Zepeda-Escobar, Jose A.; Montes de Oca-Jimenez, Roberto; Estrada-Franco, Jose G.; Barbabosa-Pliego, Alberto; Penuelas-Rivas, Giovanna; Salazar-Garcia, Felix; Vazquez-Chagoyan, Juan C.] Univ Autonoma Estado Mexico, Ctr Invest & Estudios Avanzados Salud Anim, Toluca, Mexico; [Ochoa-Garcia, Laucel] Inst Salud Estado Mexico, Lab Estatal Salud Publ, Toluca, Mexico; [Alejandre-Aguilar, Ricardo; Rivas, Nancy] Inst Politecn Nacl, Escuela Nacl Ciencias Biol, Dept Parasitol, Lab Entomol, Mexico City, DF, Mexico; [Val-Arreola, Margarita] Hosp Gen Zona 2, Inst Mexicano Seguro Social, Irapuato, Mexico; [Gupta, Shivali; Garg, Nisha J.] Univ Texas Med Branch, Dept Microbiol & Immunol, Galveston, TX 77555 USA; [Garg, Nisha J.] Univ Texas Med Branch, Dept Pathol, Galveston, TX 77555 USA; [Garg, Nisha J.] Univ Texas Med Branch, Fac Inst Human Infect & Immun, Galveston, TX 77555 USA; [Garg, Nisha J.] Univ Texas Med Branch, Sealy Ctr Vaccine Dev, Galveston, TX 77555 USA","Aparicio-Burgos, JE (reprint author), Univ Autonoma Estado Hidalgo, Escuela Super Apan, Apan Hidalgo, Mexico.",nigarg@utmb.edu; jcvch@yahoo.com,"Barbabosa Pliego, Alberto/B-1547-2016; Burgos, Jose Esteban Aparicio/P-3464-2019; Vazquez-Chagoyan, Juan Carlos/D-2666-2017","Barbabosa Pliego, Alberto/0000-0002-7565-088X; Burgos, Jose Esteban Aparicio/0000-0002-7611-7825; SALAZAR-GARCIA, FELIX/0000-0003-2281-4753; Vazquez-Chagoyan, Juan Carlos/0000-0001-8430-3778","National Institutes of Health/National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases [AI072538]; American Heart Association [0855059F]; Universidad Autonoma del Estado de Mexico [2381/2006U]; Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia [156701, 84863, 45892, 310172]; Sealy Center for Vaccine Development at the University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston","This work was supported by: National Institutes of Health/National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases http://www.niaid.nih.gov/Pages/default.aspx GRANT NUMBER (AI072538) NJG; American Heart Association http://www.heart.org/HEARTORG/ GRANT NUMBER (0855059F) to NJG; Universidad Autonoma del Estado de Mexico http://www.uaemex.mx GRANT NUMBER (2381/2006U) to JCVC; Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia http://www.conacyt.gob.mx GRANT NUMBER (156701) to JCVC; Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia http://www.conacyt.gob.mx GRANT NUMBER (84863) to JGEF.

We have videoed the cortical meninges and superficial parenchyma of C56BL/6 reporter mice infected with T. b. brucei. By use of a two-photon microscope to image through the thinned skull, the integrity of the tissues was maintained. We observed a 47-fold increase in CD2+ T cells in the meninges by 12 days post infection (dpi). CD11c+ dendritic cells also increased, and extravascular trypanosomes, made visible either by expression of a fluorescent protein, or by intravenous injection of furamidine, appeared. The likelihood that invasion will spread from the meninges to the parenchyma will depend strongly on whether the trypanosomes are below the arachnoid membrane, or above it, in the dura. Making use of optical signals from the skull bone, blood vessels and dural cells, we conclude that up to 40 dpi, the extravascular trypanosomes were essentially confined to the dura, as were the great majority of the T cells. Inhibition of T cell activation by intraperitoneal injection of abatacept reduced the numbers of meningeal T cells at 12 dpi and their mean speed fell from 11.64 +/- 0.34 mu m/min (mean +/- SEM) to 5.2 +/- 1.2 mu m/min (p = 0.007). The T cells occasionally made contact lasting tens of minutes with dendritic cells, indicative of antigen presentation. The population and motility of the trypanosomes tended to decline after about 30 dpi. We suggest that the lymphocyte infiltration of the meninges may later contribute to encephalitis, but have no evidence that the dural trypanosomes invade the parenchyma.","[Coles, Jonathan A.; Myburgh, Elmarie; Ritchie, Ryan; Hamilton, Alana; Mottram, Jeremy C.; Barrett, Michael P.; Brewer, James M.] Univ Glasgow, Wellcome Trust Ctr Mol Parasitol, Glasgow, Lanark, Scotland; [Coles, Jonathan A.; Myburgh, Elmarie; Ritchie, Ryan; Hamilton, Alana; Rodgers, Jean; Mottram, Jeremy C.; Barrett, Michael P.; Brewer, James M.] Univ Glasgow, Coll Med Vet & Life Sci, Inst Infect Immun & Inflammat, Glasgow, Lanark, Scotland","Coles, JA (reprint author), Univ Glasgow, Wellcome Trust Ctr Mol Parasitol, Glasgow, Lanark, Scotland.",Jonathan.Coles@glasgow.ac.uk,"; Brewer, James/A-7186-2010","Rodgers, Jean/0000-0002-2093-3882; Barrett, Mike/0000-0001-9447-3519; Hamilton, Alana/0000-0001-5704-2293; Mottram, Jeremy/0000-0001-5574-3766; Brewer, James/0000-0001-7933-0915; Myburgh, Elmarie/0000-0002-2007-5902",Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation [OPPGH5337]; Scottish Funding Council (SULSA); Wellcome Trust [085349],"This work was funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation [OPPGH5337] (http://www.gatesfoundation.org/) and the Scottish Funding Council (SULSA) (http://www.sulsa.ac.uk/).

Typhi was an uncommon cause of bloodstream infection (BSI) in Blantyre, Malawi and it was usually susceptible to first-line antimicrobial therapy. In 2011 an increase in a multidrug resistant (MDR) strain was detected through routine bacteriological surveillance conducted at Queen Elizabeth Central Hospital (QECH). Methods Longitudinal trends in culture-confirmed Typhoid admissions at QECH were described between 1998-2014. A retrospective review of patient cases notes was conducted, focusing on clinical presentation, prevalence of HIV and case-fatality. Isolates of S. Typhi were sequenced and the phylogeny of Typhoid in Blantyre was reconstructed and placed in a global context. Results Between 1998-2010, there were a mean of 14 microbiological diagnoses of Typhoid/year at QECH, of which 6.8% were MDR. This increased to 67 in 2011 and 782 in 2014 at which time 97% were MDR. The disease predominantly affected children and young adults (median age 11 [IQR 6-21] in 2014). The prevalence of HIV in adult patients was 16.7% [8/48], similar to that of the general population (17.8%). Overall, the case fatality rate was 2.5% (3/94). Complications included anaemia, myocarditis, pneumonia and intestinal perforation. 112 isolates were sequenced and the phylogeny demonstrated the introduction and clonal expansion of the H58 lineage of S. Typhi. Conclusions Since 2011, there has been a rapid increase in the incidence of multidrug resistant, H58-lineage Typhoid in Blantyre. This is one of a number of reports of the re-emergence of Typhoid in Southern and Eastern Africa. There is an urgent need to understand the reservoirs and transmission of disease and how to arrest this regional increase.","[Feasey, Nicholas A.; Gaskell, Katherine; Msefula, Chisomo; Selemani, George; Mallewa, Jane; Bennett, Aisleen; Heyderman, Robert S.] Univ Malawi, Coll Med, Malawi Liverpool Wellcome Trust Clin Res Programm, Blantyre, Malawi; [Feasey, Nicholas A.; Heyderman, Robert S.] Univ Liverpool, Liverpool Sch Trop Med, Liverpool L3 5QA, Merseyside, England; [Feasey, Nicholas A.; Wong, Vanessa; Parkhill, Julian; Dougan, Gordon] Wellcome Trust Sanger Inst, Hinxton, Cambs, England; [Msefula, Chisomo; Allain, Theresa J.; Mallewa, Jane; Kennedy, Neil; Nyirongo, Joram O.; Nyondo, Patience A.; Zulu, Madalitso D.] Univ Malawi, Coll Med, Blantyre, Malawi; [Kumwenda, Save] Univ Malawi, Polytech, Blantyre, Malawi; [Bennett, Aisleen; Gordon, Melita A.] Univ Liverpool, Inst Infect & Global Hlth, Liverpool L69 3BX, Merseyside, England","Feasey, NA (reprint author), Univ Malawi, Coll Med, Malawi Liverpool Wellcome Trust Clin Res Programm, Blantyre, Malawi.",nfeasey@liverpool.ac.uk,"Parkhill, Julian/G-4703-2011; Gordon, Melita/F-5563-2012","Parkhill, Julian/0000-0002-7069-5958; Feasey, Nicholas/0000-0003-4041-1405; Gaskell, Katherine/0000-0003-4691-6359; Gordon, Melita/0000-0002-0629-0884; bennett, aisleen/0000-0003-4240-1972; Heyderman, Robert/0000-0003-4573-449X","Wellcome Trust [WT092152MA, 101113/Z/13/Z084, 098051]; National Institute for Health Research [2755, 2943]","This work was supported by the Wellcome Trust: NAF was supported by Wellcome Trust Research Fellowship WT092152MA and MLW is supported by Wellcome Trust Core Award 101113/Z/13/Z084.

Additionally, it could provide some advantages to Leishmania parasites, such as a higher capacity to survive in stress conditions. In this work, in mixed populations of Leishmania donovani parasites, we have analyzed whether experimentally resistant lines to one or two combined anti-leishmanial drugs better support the stress conditions than a susceptible line expressing luciferase (Luc line). In the absence of stress, none of the Leishmania lines showed growth advantage relative to the other when mixed at a 1: 1 parasite ratio. However, when promastigotes from resistant lines and the Luc line were mixed and exposed to different stresses, we observed that the resistant lines are more tolerant of different stress conditions: nutrient starvation and heat shock-pH stress. Further to this, we observed that intracellular amastigotes from resistant lines present a higher capacity to survive inside the macrophages than those of the control line. These results suggest that resistant parasites acquire an overall fitness increase and that resistance to drug combinations presents significant differences in their fitness capacity versus single-drug resistant parasites, particularly in intracellular amastigotes. These results contribute to the assessment of the possible impact of drug resistance on leishmaniasis control programs.","[Garcia-Hernandez, Raquel; Gomez-Perez, Veronica; Castanys, Santiago; Gamarro, Francisco] IPBLN CSIC, Inst Parasitol & Biomed Lopez Neyra, Parque Tecnol Ciencias Salud, Granada, Spain","Garcia-Hernandez, R (reprint author), IPBLN CSIC, Inst Parasitol & Biomed Lopez Neyra, Parque Tecnol Ciencias Salud, Granada, Spain.",gamarro@ipb.csic.es,,,"Plan Andaluz de Investigacion (Proyecto de Excelencia), Junta de Andalucia [CTS-7282]; Subdireccion General de Redes y Centros de Investigacion Cooperativa-FEDER, RICET project [RD12/0018/0017];  [SAF2012-34267];  [SAF2011-28102]","This work was supported by Plan Andaluz de Investigacion (Proyecto de Excelencia CTS-7282), Junta de Andalucia (FG).

This study aims to estimate the public health and economic burden of rabies circulating in domestic dog populations, globally and on a country-by-country basis, allowing an objective assessment of how much this preventable disease costs endemic countries. Methodology/Principal Findings We established relationships between rabies mortality and rabies prevention and control measures, which we incorporated into a model framework. We used data derived from extensive literature searches and questionnaires on disease incidence, control interventions and preventative measures within this framework to estimate the disease burden. The burden of rabies impacts on public health sector budgets, local communities and livestock economies, with the highest risk of rabies in the poorest regions of the world. This study estimates that globally canine rabies causes approximately 59,000 (95% Confidence Intervals: 25-159,000) human deaths, over 3.7 million (95% CIs: 1.6-10.4 million) disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) and 8.6 billion USD (95% CIs: 2.9-21.5 billion) economic losses annually. The largest component of the economic burden is due to premature death (55%), followed by direct costs of post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP, 20%) and lost income whilst seeking PEP (15.5%), with only limited costs to the veterinary sector due to dog vaccination (1.5%), and additional costs to communities from livestock losses (6%). Conclusions/Significance This study demonstrates that investment in dog vaccination, the single most effective way of reducing the disease burden, has been inadequate and that the availability and affordability of PEP needs improving. Collaborative investments by medical and veterinary sectors could dramatically reduce the current large, and unnecessary, burden of rabies on affected communities. Improved surveillance is needed to reduce uncertainty in burden estimates and to monitor the impacts of control efforts.","[Hampson, Katie; Lembo, Tiziana; Cleaveland, Sarah] Univ Glasgow, Boyd Orr Ctr Populat & Ecosyst Hlth, Inst Biodivers Anim Hlth & Comparat Med, Glasgow, Lanark, Scotland; [Coudeville, Laurent; Kieffer, Alexia; Attlan, Michael] Sanofi Pasteur, Lyon, France; [Sambo, Maganga] Ifakara Hlth Inst, Ifakara, Tanzania; [Barrat, Jacques] ANSES French Agcy Food Environm & Occupat Hlth &, Rabies & Wildlife Lab Nancy, Atton, France; [Blanton, Jesse D.; Recuenco, Sergio] Ctr Dis Control & Prevent, Atlanta, GA USA; [Briggs, Deborah J.; Costa, Peter; Knopf, Lea; Miranda, Mary Elizabeth; Rupprecht, Charles E.; Taylor, Louise] Global Alliance Rabies Control, Manhattan, KS USA; [Freuling, Conrad M.; Mueller, Thomas] Fed Res Inst Anim Hlth, Friedrich Loeffler Inst, Greifswald, Germany; [Hiby, Elly] Int Compan Anim Management Coalit, Cambridge, England; [Leanes, Fernando; Natal Vigilato, Marco Antonio] Pan Amer Hlth Org, Rio De Janeiro, Brazil; [Metlin, Artem] Inst Pasteur Cambodia, Phnom Penh, Cambodia; [Nel, Louis H.] Univ Pretoria, ZA-0002 Pretoria, South Africa; [Rupprecht, Charles E.] Ross Univ, Sch Vet Med, Basseterre, St Kitts, St Kitts & Nevi; [Schumacher, Carolin] Merial, Lyon, France; [Zinsstag, Jakob] Swiss Trop & Publ Hlth Inst, Basel, Switzerland; [Dushoff, Jonathan] McMaster Univ, Hamilton, ON, Canada","Hampson, K (reprint author), Univ Glasgow, Boyd Orr Ctr Populat & Ecosyst Hlth, Inst Biodivers Anim Hlth & Comparat Med, Glasgow, Lanark, Scotland.",katie.hampson@glasgow.ac.uk,"Sambo, Maganga/I-4697-2019; Nel, Louis H/F-1001-2012; Taylor, Louise/H-9765-2019; Zinsstag, Jakob/A-8317-2008; Vigilato, Marco Antonio Natal/G-3848-2012","Sambo, Maganga/0000-0002-7350-1143; Nel, Louis H/0000-0001-8963-0153; Taylor, Louise/0000-0001-8141-2346; Zinsstag, Jakob/0000-0002-8899-6097; Vigilato, Marco Antonio Natal/0000-0003-3920-0766; Metlin, Artem/0000-0002-4283-0171; Recuenco-Cabrera, Sergio/0000-0002-8446-7411; Cleaveland, Sarah/0000-0002-0456-0959; Blanton, Jesse/0000-0002-2634-355X; Hampson, Katie/0000-0001-5392-6884",UBS Optimus Foundation; Wellcome Trust [095787/Z/11/Z]; Medical Research Council [G0901135],"This study was funded by the UBS Optimus Foundation (http://www.ubs.com/optimus-foundation) and the Wellcome Trust (095787/Z/11/Z).

Burden of disease, risk factors and transmission are hitherto sparsely described. Methods From the EMINI (Evaluating and Monitoring the Impact of New Interventions) population cohort, we randomly selected 1,228 persons above the age of 5 years from the nine participating communities in Mbeya region, Southwestern Tanzania, stratified by age, altitude of residence and ownership of domestic mammals, to conduct a cross-sectional seroprevalence study in. The aim was to estimate the seroprevalence of IgG antibodies against Spotted Fever Group (SFG) rickettsiae and to assess socioeconomic and environmental risk factors. Serology (indirect immunofluorescence) was performed at a dilution of 1: 64. Results SFG-seropositivity in the cohort was found to be 67.9%(range among nine sites: 42.8-91.4%). Multivariable analysis revealed an association with age (prevalence ratio, PR per 10 years: 1.08; 95% CI 1.06-1.10), warmer temperatures (PR per degrees C: 1.38; 1.11-1.71), male gender (PR 1.08; 1.00-1.16), and low population density (PR per 1.000 persons/km(2) increase 0.96; 0.94-0.99). At higher elevations, higher cattle density was associated with higher seroprevalence. Conclusion SFG rickettsial infection seems to be common in the more rural population of Mbeya Region. Spread seems to be further limited by temperature and higher elevation. Examination of the contribution of SFG to febrile illnesses seems warranted in a prospective study to estimate the disease burden in the population. This will also allow determination of the causative pathogens.","[Heinrich, Norbert; Dill, Tatjana; Clowes, Petra; Kroidl, Inge; Loescher, Thomas; Hoelscher, Michael; Saathoff, Elmar] Univ Munich LMU, Med Ctr, Div Infect Dis & Trop Med, Munich, Germany; [Heinrich, Norbert; Starke, Mandy; Hoelscher, Michael; Saathoff, Elmar] German Ctr Infect Res DZIF, Munich, Germany; [Dobler, Gerhard; Starke, Mandy] Bundeswehr Inst Microbiol, Munich, Germany; [Dobler, Gerhard; Starke, Mandy] DZIF German Ctr Infect Res, Munich, Germany; [Dobler, Gerhard; Starke, Mandy] German Partnership Program Excellence Biol & Hlth, Munich, Germany; [Clowes, Petra; Kroidl, Inge; Ntinginya, Nyanda Elias; Maboko, Leonard; Hoelscher, Michael] NIMR Mbeya Med Res Ctr, Mbeya, Tanzania","Heinrich, N (reprint author), Univ Munich LMU, Med Ctr, Div Infect Dis & Trop Med, Munich, Germany.",heinrich@lrz.uni-muenchen.de,"N, Heinrich/B-3750-2014; Hoelscher, Michael/D-3436-2012","N, Heinrich/0000-0001-9252-7106; ","European Union [SANTE/2004/078-545/130, SANTE/2006/129-931]; German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) [01KA0903]","The EMINI study was funded by two grants from the European Union (SANTE/2004/078-545/130 and SANTE/2006/129-931).

The patterns of hydrolysis by these three SVMPs of laminin, type VI collagen and nidogen in vivo greatly differ, whereas the three enzymes showed a similar pattern of degradation of type IV collagen, supporting the concept that hydrolysis of this component is critical for the destabilization of microvessel structure leading to hemorrhage. Proteomic analysis of wound exudate revealed similarities and differences between the action of the three SVMPs. Higher extent of proteolysis was observed for the PI enzyme regarding several extracellular matrix components and fibrinogen, whereas exudates from mice injected with PII and PIII SVMPs had higher amounts of some intracellular proteins.

But is dengue still an NTD or not? Classifying dengue as an NTD may carry advantages, but is it justified? This review considers the criteria for the definition of an NTD, the current diverse lists of NTDs by different stakeholders, and the commonalities and differences of dengue with other NTDs. We also review the current research gaps and research activities and the adequacy of funding for dengue research and development (R&D) (2003-2013). NTD definitions have been developed to a higher precision since the early 2000s, with the following main features: NTDs are characterised as a) poverty related, b) endemic to the tropics and subtropics, c) lacking public health attention, d) having poor research funding and shortcomings in R&D, e) usually associated with high morbidity but low mortality, and f) often having no specific treatment available. Dengue meets most of these criteria, but not all. Although dengue predominantly affects resource-limited countries, it does not necessarily only target the poor and marginalised in those countries. Dengue increasingly attracts public health attention, and in some affected countries it is now a high profile disease. Research funding for dengue has increased exponentially in the past two decades, in particular in the area of dengue vaccine development. However, despite advances in dengue research, dengue epidemics are increasing in frequency and magnitude, and dengue is expanding to new areas. Specific treatment and a highly effective vaccine remain elusive. Major research gaps exist in the area of integrated surveillance and vector control. Hence, although dengue differs from many of the NTDs, it still meets important criteria commonly used for NTDs. The current need for increased R& D spending, shared by dengue and other NTDs, is perhaps the key reason why dengue should continue to be considered an NTD.","[Horstick, Olaf; Tozan, Yesim; Wilder-Smith, Annelies] Heidelberg Univ, Inst Publ Hlth, Heidelberg, Germany; [Tozan, Yesim] NYU, Steinhardt Sch Culture Educ & Human Dev, New York, NY USA; [Tozan, Yesim] NYU, Global Inst Publ Hlth, New York, NY USA; [Wilder-Smith, Annelies] Nanyang Technol Univ, Lee Kong Chian Sch Med, Singapore 639798, Singapore; [Wilder-Smith, Annelies] Umea Univ, Dept Global Hlth & Epidemiol, Umea, Sweden","Horstick, O (reprint author), Heidelberg Univ, Inst Publ Hlth, Heidelberg, Germany.",Olaf.Horstick@uni-heidelberg.de,"Wilder-Smith, Annelies/F-8751-2015",,European Union [282589],"No funds were received for this review.

Almost 200 million people live in extreme poverty in ASEAN countries, mostly in the low or lower middle-income countries of Indonesia, the Philippines, Myanmar, Viet Nam, and Cambodia, and many of them are affected by at least one NTD. However, NTDs are prevalent even among upper middle-income ASEAN countries such as Malaysia and Thailand, especially among the indigenous populations. The three major intestinal helminth infections are the most common NTDs; each helminthiasis is associated with approximately 100 million infections in the region. In addition, more than 10 million people suffer from either liver or intestinal fluke infections, as well as schistosomiasis and lymphatic filariasis (LF). Intestinal protozoan infections are widespread, while leishmaniasis has emerged in Thailand, and zoonotic malaria (Plasmodium knowlesi infection) causes severe morbidity in Malaysia. Melioidosis has emerged as an important bacterial NTD, as have selected rickettsial infections, and leptospirosis. Leprosy, yaws, and trachoma are still endemic in focal areas. Almost 70 million cases of dengue fever occur annually in ASEAN countries, such that this arboviral infection is now one of the most common and economically important NTDs in the region. A number of other arboviral and zoonotic viral infections have also emerged, including Japanese encephalitis; tick-borne viral infections; Nipah virus, a zoonosis present in fruit bats; and enterovirus 71 infection. There are urgent needs to expand surveillance activities in ASEAN countries, as well as to ensure mass drug administration is provided to populations at risk for intestinal helminth and fluke infections, LF, trachoma, and yaws. An ASEAN Network for Drugs, Diagnostics, Vaccines, and Traditional Medicines Innovation provides a policy framework for the development of new control and elimination tools. Together with prominent research institutions and universities, the World Health Organization (WHO), and its regional offices, these organizations could implement important public health improvements through NTD control and elimination in the coming decade.","[Hotez, Peter J.; Bottazzi, Maria Elena; Strych, Ulrich] Baylor Coll Med, Natl Sch Trop Med, Sabin Vaccine Inst, Houston, TX 77030 USA; [Hotez, Peter J.; Bottazzi, Maria Elena; Strych, Ulrich] Baylor Coll Med, Dept Pediat, Texas Childrens Hosp, Ctr Vaccine Dev,Natl Sch Trop Med, Houston, TX 77030 USA; [Hotez, Peter J.; Bottazzi, Maria Elena; Strych, Ulrich] Baylor Coll Med, Dept Mol Virol & Microbiol, Texas Childrens Hosp, Ctr Vaccine Dev,Natl Sch Trop Med, Houston, TX 77030 USA; [Hotez, Peter J.; Bottazzi, Maria Elena] Baylor Univ, Dept Biol, Waco, TX 76798 USA; [Hotez, Peter J.] Rice Univ, James A Baker III Inst Publ Policy, Houston, TX USA; [Chang, Li-Yen; AbuBakar, Sazaly] Univ Malaya, Dept Med Microbiol, Trop Infect Dis Res & Educ Ctr, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia; [Lim, Yvonne A.

The Eliminate Dengue (ED) Program is investigating the use of Wolbachia-infected, transmission-compromised, mosquitoes to reduce dengue transmission. Previous introductions of genetically-modified strategies for dengue vector control have generated controversy internationally by inadequately engaging host communities. Community Engagement (CE) was a key component of the ED Program's initial open release trials in Queensland Australia. Their approach to CE was perceived as effective by the ED team's senior leadership, members of its CE team, and by its funders, but if and why this was the case was unclear. We conducted a qualitative case study of the ED Program's approach to CE to identify and critically examine its components, and to explain whether and how these efforts contributed to the support received by stakeholders. Methodology/Principal Findings In-depth semi-structured interviews were conducted with 24 participants with a range of experiences and perspectives related to the ED Program's CE activities. Our analytic approach combined techniques of grounded theory and qualitative description. The ED Program's approach to CE reflected four foundational features: 1) enabling conditions; 2) leadership; 3) core commitments and guiding values; and 4) formative social science research. These foundations informed five key operational practices: 1) building the CE team; 2) integrating CE into management practices; 3) discerning the community of stakeholders; 4) establishing and maintaining a presence in the community; and 5) socializing the technology and research strategy. We also demonstrate how these practices contributed to stakeholders' willingness to support the trials. Conclusions/Significance Our case study has identified, and explained the functional relationships among, the critical features of the ED Program's approach to CE. It has also illuminated how these features were meaningful to stakeholders and contributed to garnering support within the host communities for the open-release trials. Our findings reveal how translating ethical intentions into effective action is more socially complex than is currently reflected in the CE literature. Because our case study delineates the critical features of the ED Program's approach to CE, it can serve as a framework for other programs to follow when designing their own strategies. And because the findings outline a theory of change for CE, it can also serve as a starting point for developing an evaluation framework for CE.","[Kolopack, Pamela A.; Lavery, James V.] St Michaels Hosp, Ctr Eth Social & Cultural Risk, Toronto, ON M5B 1W8, Canada; [Kolopack, Pamela A.; Parsons, Janet A.; Lavery, James V.] St Michaels Hosp, Li Ka Shing Knowledge Inst, Toronto, ON M5B 1W8, Canada; [Kolopack, Pamela A.; Lavery, James V.] Univ Toronto, Dalla Lana Sch Publ Hlth, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Parsons, Janet A.] St Michaels Hosp, Appl Hlth Res Ctr, Toronto, ON M5B 1W8, Canada; [Parsons, Janet A.] Univ Toronto, Dept Phys Therapy, Toronto, ON, Canada","Kolopack, PA (reprint author), St Michaels Hosp, Ctr Eth Social & Cultural Risk, 30 Bond St, Toronto, ON M5B 1W8, Canada.",laveryj@smh.ca,,,"Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation [23591]; Ethical, Social & Cultural Program for Global Health, St. Michael's Hospital","The work was funded by a contract with the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation (#23591), The Ethical, Social & Cultural Program for Global Health, St. Michael's Hospital.

Predictive risk maps are an important tool to guide and support control activities. Methodology STH infection prevalence data were obtained from surveys carried out in 2011 using standard protocols. Data were geo-referenced and collated in a nationwide, geographic information system database. Bayesian geostatistical models with remotely sensed environmental covariates and variable selection procedures were utilized to predict the spatial distribution of STH infections in Nigeria. Principal Findings We found that hookworm, Ascaris lumbricoides, and Trichuris trichiura infections are endemic in 482 (86.8%), 305 (55.0%), and 55 (9.9%) locations, respectively. Hookworm and A. lumbricoides infection co-exist in 16 states, while the three species are co-endemic in 12 states. Overall, STHs are endemic in 20 of the 36 states of Nigeria, including the Federal Capital Territory of Abuja. The observed prevalence at endemic locations ranged from 1.7% to 51.7% for hookworm, from 1.6% to 77.8% for A. lumbricoides, and from 1.0% to 25.5% for T. trichiura. Model-based predictions ranged from 0.7% to 51.0% for hookworm, from 0.1% to 82.6% for A. lumbricoides, and from 0.0% to 18.5% for T. trichiura. Our models suggest that day land surface temperature and dense vegetation are important predictors of the spatial distribution of STH infection in Nigeria. In 2011, a total of 5.7 million (13.8%) schoolaged children were predicted to be infected with STHs in Nigeria. Mass treatment at the local government area level for annual or bi-annual treatment of the school-aged population in Nigeria in 2011, based on World Health Organization prevalence thresholds, were estimated at 10.2 million tablets. Conclusions/Significance The predictive risk maps and estimated deworming needs presented here will be helpful for escalating the control and spatial targeting of interventions against STH infections in Nigeria.","[Oluwole, Akinola S.; Ekpo, Uwem F.; Abe, Eniola M.] Fed Univ Agr, Dept Biol Sci, Abeokuta, Nigeria; [Karagiannis-Voules, Dimitrios-Alexios; Utzinger, Juerg; Vounatsou, Penelope] Swiss Trop & Publ Hlth Inst, Dept Epidemiol & Publ Hlth, Basel, Switzerland; [Karagiannis-Voules, Dimitrios-Alexios; Utzinger, Juerg; Vounatsou, Penelope] Univ Basel, Basel, Switzerland; [Abe, Eniola M.; Braide, Eka I.] Fed Univ, Dept Zool, Lafia, Nigeria; [Olamiju, Francisca O.] Mission Save Helpless MITOSATH, Jos, Nigeria; [Isiyaku, Sunday] Sightsavers, Nigeria Country Off, Kaduna, Nigeria; [Okoronkwo, Chukwu; Saka, Yisa; Nebe, Obiageli J.] Fed Minist Hlth, Dept Publ Hlth, Abuja, Nigeria; [Mafiana, Chiedu F.] Natl Univ Commiss, Abuja, Nigeria","Oluwole, AS (reprint author), Fed Univ Agr, Dept Biol Sci, Abeokuta, Nigeria.",ufekpo@hotmail.com,,"Vounatsou, Penelope/0000-0002-4904-5352; OLUWOLE, AKINOLA/0000-0002-0050-3463",European Foundation Initiative for African Research into Neglected Tropical Diseases (EFINTD) [AZ:86 527]; Swiss National Science Foundation [PDFMP3-137156]; EFINTD [AZ:86527],"Financial support for data collection and analysis of this work was provided by European Foundation Initiative for African Research into Neglected Tropical Diseases (EFINTD), provided to UFE, ASO and EMA (grant no: AZ:86 527).

We assessed surveillance in Gaffargaon upazila (a subdistrict of 13 unions) of Mymensingh district, Bangladesh highly endemic for kala-azar. Methods In 4703 randomly sampled households, within nine randomly sampled villages, drawn from three randomly sampled unions, we actively searched for kala-azar cases that had occurred between January 2010 and December 2011. We then searched for medical records of these cases in the patient registers of Gaffargaon upazila health complex (UHC). We investigated factors associated with the medical recording by interviewing the cases and their families. We also did a general observation of UHC recording systems and interviewed health staff responsible for the monthly reports of kala-azar cases. Results Our active case finding detected 58 cases, but 29 were not recorded in the Gaffargaon UHC. Thus, only 50% (95% CI: 37%-63%) of kala-azar cases were reported via the government passive surveillance system. Interviews with health staff based in the study UHC revealed the heavy reporting burden for multiple diseases, variation in staff experience, high demands on the staff time and considerable complexity in the recording system. After adjusting for kala-azar treatment drug, recording was found more likely for those aged 18 years or more, males, receiving supply and administration of drug at the UHC, and more recent treatment. Discussion Fifty percent of kala-azar cases occurring in one highly endemic area of Bangladesh were recorded in registers that were the source for monthly reports to the national surveillance system. Recording was influenced by patient, treatment, staff and system factors. Our findings have policy implications for the national surveillance system. Future studies involving larger samples and including interviews with health authorities at more central level and surveillance experts at the national level will generate more precise and representative evidence on the performance of kala-azar surveillance in Bangladesh.","[Rahman, Kazi Mizanur; Sumon, Shariful Amin; Biswas, Subrata Kumar; Luby, Stephen P.] Int Ctr Diarrhoeal Dis Res, Dhaka 1000, Bangladesh; [Rahman, Kazi Mizanur; Samarawickrema, Indira V.

In the United States strongyloidiasis is recognized as an important infection in immigrants and refugees. Public health and commercial reference laboratories need a simple and reliable method for diagnosis of strongyloidiasis to identify and treat cases and to prevent transmission. The recognized laboratory test of choice for diagnosis of strongyloidiasis is detection of disease specific antibodies, most commonly using a crude parasite extract for detection of IgG antibodies. Recently, a luciferase tagged recombinant protein of S. stercoralis, Ss-NIE-1, has been used in a luciferase immunoprecipitation system (LIPS) to detect IgG and IgG(4) specific antibodies. To promote wider adoption of immunoassays for strongyloidiasis, we used the Ss-NIE-1 recombinant antigen without the luciferase tag and developed ELISA and fluorescent bead (Luminex) assays to detect S. stercoralis specific IgG(4). We evaluated the assays using well-characterized sera from persons with or without presumed strongyloidiasis. The sensitivity and specificity of Ss-NIE-1 IgG(4) ELISA were 95% and 93%, respectively. For the IgG(4) Luminex assay, the sensitivity and specificity were 93% and 95%, respectively. Specific IgG(4) antibody decreased after treatment in a manner that was similar to the decrease of specific IgG measured in the crude IgG ELISA. The sensitivities of the Ss-NIE-1 IgG(4) ELISA and Luminex assays were comparable to the crude IgG ELISA but with improved specificities. However, the Ss-NIE-1 based assays are not dependent on native parasite materials and can be performed using widely available laboratory equipment. In conclusion, these newly developed Ss-NIE-1 based immunoassays can be readily adopted by public health and commercial reference laboratories for routine screening and clinical diagnosis of S. stercoralis infection in refugees and immigrants in the United States.","[Rascoe, Lisa N.; Price, Courtney; McAuliffe, Isabel; Handali, Sukwan] Ctr Dis Control & Prevent, Div Parasit Dis & Malaria, Atlanta, GA 30329 USA; [Shin, Sun Hee] Emory Univ, Emory Coll, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA; [Priest, Jeffrey W.] Ctr Dis Controls & Prevent, Div Foodborne Waterborne & Environm Dis, Atlanta, GA USA","Rascoe, LN (reprint author), Ctr Dis Control & Prevent, Div Parasit Dis & Malaria, Atlanta, GA 30329 USA.",ahi0@cdc.gov,,"Price, Courtney/0000-0001-8003-2253",,,,30,11,11,0,4,PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE,SAN FRANCISCO,"1160 BATTERY STREET, STE 100, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94111 USA",1935-2735,,,PLOS NEGLECT TROP D,Plos Neglect.

Despite the high annual incidence and significant morbidity and mortality rates, currently there are no approved vaccines to prevent infection or disease in humans. Genetically, LASV demonstrates a high degree of diversity that correlates with geographic distribution. The genetic heterogeneity observed between geographically distinct viruses raises concerns over the potential efficacy of a ""universal"" LASV vaccine. To date, several experimental LASV vaccines have been developed; however, few have been evaluated against challenge with various genetically unique Lassa virus isolates in relevant animal models. Methodologies/principle findings Here we demonstrate that a single, prophylactic immunization with a recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) expressing the glycoproteins of LASV strain Josiah from Sierra Leone protects strain 13 guinea pigs from infection/disease following challenge with LASV isolates originating from Liberia, Mali and Nigeria. Similarly, the VSV-based LASV vaccine yields complete protection against a lethal challenge with the Liberian LASV isolate in the gold-standard macaque model of Lassa fever. Conclusions/significance Our results demonstrate the VSV-based LASV vaccine is capable of preventing morbidity and mortality associated with non-homologous LASV challenge in two animal models of Lassa fever. Additionally, this work highlights the need for the further development of disease models for geographical distinct LASV strains, particularly those from Nigeria, in order to comprehensively evaluate potential vaccines and therapies against this prominent agent of viral hemorrhagic fever.","[Safronetz, David; Rosenke, Kyle; Haddock, Elaine; Feldmann, Heinz] NIAID, Virol Lab, Div Intramural Res, Rocky Mt Labs,NIH, Hamilton, MT 59840 USA; [Mire, Chad; Geisbert, Thomas] Univ Texas Med Branch, Galveston Natl Lab, Galveston, TX 77555 USA; [Mire, Chad; Geisbert, Thomas] Univ Texas Med Branch, Dept Microbiol & Immunol, Galveston, TX 77555 USA; [Feldmann, Friederike] NIAID, Rocky Mt Vet Branch, Div Intramural Res, Rocky Mt Labs,NIH, Hamilton, MT USA","Safronetz, D (reprint author), NIAID, Virol Lab, Div Intramural Res, Rocky Mt Labs,NIH, Hamilton, MT 59840 USA.",safronetzd@niaid.nih.gov; feldmannh@niaid.nih.gov,,,"Division of Intramural Research, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA","This work was supported by the Division of Intramural Research, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA.

There are only two anti-parasitic drugs available to treat this disease, benznidazole and nifurtimox. Thus it is important to identify and validate new drug targets in Trypanosoma cruzi, the causative agent. T. cruzi expresses an ER-localised ascorbate-dependent peroxidase (TcAPx). This parasite-specific enzyme has attracted interest from the perspective of targeted chemotherapy. Methodology/Principal Findings To assess the importance of TcAPx in protecting T. cruzi from oxidative stress and to determine if it is essential for virulence, we generated nullmutants by targeted gene disruption. Loss of activity was associated with increased sensitivity to exogenous hydrogen peroxide, but had no effect on susceptibility to the front-line Chagas disease drug benznidazole. This suggests that increased oxidative stress in the ER does not play a significant role in its mechanism of action. Homozygous knockouts could proceed through the entire life-cycle in vitro, although they exhibited a significant decrease in their ability to infect mammalian cells. To investigate virulence, we exploited a highly sensitive bioluminescence imaging system which allows parasites to be monitored in real-time in the chronic stage of murine infections. This showed that depletion of enzyme activity had no effect on T. cruzi replication, dissemination or tissue tropism in vivo. Conclusions/Significance TcAPx is not essential for parasite viability within the mammalian host, does not have a significant role in establishment or maintenance of chronic infections, and should therefore not be considered a priority for drug design.","[Taylor, Martin C.; Lewis, Michael D.; Francisco, Amanda Fortes; Kelly, John M.] Univ London London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, Fac Infect & Trop Dis, London WC1E 7HT, England; [Wilkinson, Shane R.] Queen Mary Univ London, Sch Biol & Chem Sci, London, England","Taylor, MC (reprint author), Univ London London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, Fac Infect & Trop Dis, Keppel St, London WC1E 7HT, England.",martin.taylor@lshtm.ac.uk,,"Lewis, Michael/0000-0001-9540-3280; Taylor, Martin/0000-0003-4147-0693",Wellcome Trust [084175]; British Heart Foundation [PG/13/88/30556]; Brazilian National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq),"This work was supported by the Wellcome Trust (Grant 084175) (http://www.wellcome.ac.uk/) and the British Heart Foundation (Grant PG/13/88/30556) (http://www.bhf.org.uk/).

To help address this issue, we compared whole genomes from 18 clinical M. ulcerans isolates from a 30km(2) region within the Asante Akim North District, Ashanti region, Ghana, with 15 other M. ulcerans isolates from elsewhere in Ghana and the surrounding countries of Ivory Coast, Togo, Benin and Nigeria. Contrary to our expectations of finding minor DNA sequence variations among isolates representing a single M. ulcerans circulating genotype, we found instead two distinct genotypes. One genotype was closely related to isolates from neighbouring regions of Amansie West and Densu, consistent with the predicted local endemic clone, but the second genotype (separated by 138 single nucleotide polymorphisms [SNPs] from other Ghanaian strains) most closely matched M. ulcerans from Nigeria, suggesting another introduction of M. ulcerans to Ghana, perhaps from that country. Both the exotic genotype and the local Ghanaian genotype displayed highly restricted intra-strain genetic variation, with less than 50 SNP differences across a 5.2Mbp core genome within each genotype. Interestingly, there was no discernible spatial clustering of genotypes at the local village scale. Interviews revealed no obvious epidemiological links among BU patients who had been infected with identical M. ulcerans genotypes but lived in geographically separate villages. We conclude that M. ulcerans is spread widely across the region, with multiple genotypes present in any one area. These data give us new perspectives on the behaviour of possible reservoirs and subsequent transmission mechanisms of M. ulcerans. These observations also show for the first time that M. ulcerans can be mobilized, introduced to a new area and then spread within a population. Potential reservoirs of M. ulcerans thus might include humans, or perhapsM. ulcerans-infected animals such as livestock that move regularly between countries.","[Ablordey, Anthony S.; Ahortor, Evans K.; Amissah, Nana Ama] Univ Ghana, Noguchi Mem Inst Med Res, Dept Bacteriol, Accra, Ghana; [Vandelannoote, Koen; Eddyani, Miriam; Durnez, Lies; Portaels, Francoise; de Jong, Bouke C.] Inst Trop Med, Dept Biomed Sci, B-2000 Antwerp, Belgium; [Frimpong, Isaac A.] Univ Ghana, Dept Anim Biol & Conservat Sci, Accra, Ghana; [Leirs, Herwig] Univ Antwerp, Dept Biol, B-2020 Antwerp, Belgium; [Porter, Jessica L.; Mangas, Kirstie M.; Lam, Margaret M.

There are growing concerns that development in the region may have increased transport of dog through Laos for regional dog meat consumption, and that this may cause spillover of the viruses from dogs brought here from other countries. This study was therefore undertaken to evaluate the current rabies situation and the genetic characteristics of rabies viruses currently circulating in Laos. Methods We determined the rate of rabies-positive samples by analyzing data from animal samples submitted to the Lao Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry's National Animal Health Centre rabies laboratory from 2004 through 2011. Twenty-three rabies-positive samples were used for viral genetic characterization. Full genome sequencing was performed on two rabies viruses. Results Rabies-positive samples increased substantially from 40.5% in 2004 to 60.2% in 2009 and continued at this level during the study period. More than 99% of the samples were from dogs, followed by cats and monkeys. Phylogenetic analyses showed that three rabies virus lineages belonging to the Southeast Asian cluster are currently circulating in Laos; these are closely related to viruses from Thailand, Cambodia and Vietnam. Lineages of the circulating Laos rabies viruses diverged from common ancestors as recently as 44.2 years and as much as 55.3 years ago, indicating periodic virus invasions. Conclusion There is an increasing trend of rabies in Laotian animals. Similar to other rabies-endemic countries, dogs are the main viral reservoir. Three viral lineages closely related to viruses from neighboring countries are currently circulating in Laos. Data provide evidence of periodic historic exchanges of the viruses with neighboring countries, but no recent invasion.","[Ahmed, Kamruddin; Matsumoto, Takashi; Mori, Daisuke; Takaki, Minako; Nishizono, Akira] Oita Univ, Dept Microbiol, Fac Med, Yufu, Japan; [Ahmed, Kamruddin] Oita Univ, Res Promot Inst, Yufu, Japan; [Phommachanh, Phouvong; Vorachith, Phengphet] Natl Anim Dis Diagnost Lab, Vientiane Capital, Laos; [Lamaningao, Pheophet] Kansai Med Univ, Dept Publ Hlth, Osaka, Japan; [Douangngeun, Bounlom] Natl Anim Hlth Ctr, Vientiane Capital, Laos; [Khambounheuang, Bounkhouang] Minist Agr & Forestry, Dept Livestock & Fisheries, Vientiane Capital, Laos","Ahmed, K (reprint author), Oita Univ, Dept Microbiol, Fac Med, Yufu, Japan.",ahmed@oita-u.ac.jp,"Ahmed, Kamruddin/I-6423-2016; Mori, Daisuke/Y-9423-2018","Ahmed, Kamruddin/0000-0002-1869-3701; Mori, Daisuke/0000-0001-6567-9438","Research Fund at the Discretion of the President, Oita University [610000-N5010, 610000-N5021]","This study was supported in part by a Research Fund at the Discretion of the President, Oita University; grant numbers: 610000-N5010 and 610000-N5021.

This form of leishmaniasis is considered largely as anthroponotic, although dogs were found infected with Leishmania tropica, suggestive of zoonosis in some rural areas. Methodology and Findings This survey aimed at (i) studying the presence of Leishmania in field caught Phlebotomus sergenti, (ii) investigating genetic diversity within Leishmania tropica and (iii) identifying the host-blood feeding preferences of Phlebotomus sergenti. A total of 4,407 sand flies were collected in three rural areas of Azilal province, using CDC miniature light traps. Samples collected were found to consist of 13 species: Phlebotomus spp. and 3 Sergentomyia spp. The most abundant species was Phlebotomus sergenti, accounting for 45.75% of the total. 965 female Phlebotomus sergenti were screened for the presence of Leishmania by ITS1-PCR-RFLP, giving a positive rate of 5.7%(55/965), all being identified as Leishmania tropica. Nucleotide heterogeneity of PCR-amplified ITS1-5.8S rRNA gene-ITS2 was noted. Analyses of 31 sequences obtained segregated them into 16 haplotypes, of which 7 contain superimposed peaks at certain nucleotide positions, suggestive of heterozygosity. Phlebotomus sergenti collected were found to feed on a large variety of vertebrate hosts, as determined by Cytochrome b sequencing of the DNA from the blood meals of 64 engorged females. Conclusion Our findings supported the notion that Phlebotomus sergenti is the primary vector of Leishmania tropica in this focus, and that the latter is genetically very heterogeneous. Furthermore, our results might be suggestive of a certain level of heterozygosity in Leishmania tropica population. This finding, as well as the feeding of the vectors on different animals are of interest for further investigation.","[Ajaoud, Malika; Es-Sette, Nargys; Lemrani, Meryem] Inst Pasteur Maroc, Lab Parasitol & Malad Vectorielles, Casablanca, Morocco; [Ajaoud, Malika] Fac Med & Pharm, Ctr Etud Doctorales Sci Sante, Casablanca, Morocco; [Charrel, Remi N.] Aix Marseille Univ, IRD French Inst Res Dev, EHESP French Sch Publ Hlth, EPV UMR D Emergence Pathol Virales 190, Marseille, France; [Charrel, Remi N.] APHM Publ Hosp Marseille, IHU Mediterranee Infect, Marseille, France; [Laamrani-Idrissi, Abderahmane; Nhammi, Haddou] Minist Sante, Direct Epidemiol & Lutte Malad, Serv Parasitol, Rabat, Morocco; [Riyad, Myriam] Fac Med & Pharm, Equipe Rech Leishmanioses Cutanees, Casablanca, Morocco","Ajaoud, M (reprint author), Inst Pasteur Maroc, Lab Parasitol & Malad Vectorielles, Casablanca, Morocco.",meryem.lemrani@pasteur.ma,"Riyad, Myriam/J-4504-2019","Charrel, Remi/0000-0002-7675-8251",Regional Office for the Eastern Mediterranean-Committee on Science and Technological Cooperation grant [RABGH 10-11/09]; European Virus Archive (European Union Seventh Framework Programme) [228292]; EDENext Seventh Framework Programme - EU project [261504]; EDENext FP7-EU project [261504],"This work was supported by Regional Office for the Eastern Mediterranean-Committee on Science and Technological Cooperation grant; RAB&GH 10-11/09.

In the Katavi-Rukwa ecosystem, humans, livestock and wildlife live in close proximity, which exposes them to the risk of a number of zoonotic infectious diseases, including leptospirosis. Methodology/Principal Findings A cross-sectional epidemiological study was carried out in the Katavi region, South-west Tanzania, to determine the seroprevalence of Leptospira spp in humans, domestic ruminants and wildlife. Blood samples were collected from humans (n = 267), cattle (n = 1,103), goats (n = 248), buffaloes (n = 38), zebra (n = 2), lions (n = 2), rodents (n = 207) and shrews (n = 11). Decanted sera were tested using the Microscopic Agglutination Test (MAT) for antibodies against six live serogroups belonging to the Leptospira spp, with a cutoff point of >= 1:160. The prevalence of leptospiral antibodies was 29.96% in humans, 30.37% in cattle, 8.47% in goats, 28.95% in buffaloes, 20.29% in rodents and 9.09% in shrews. Additionally, one of the two samples in lions was seropositive. A significant difference in the prevalence P<0.05 was observed between cattle and goats. No significant difference in prevalence was observed with respect to age and sex in humans or any of the sampled animal species. The most prevalent serogroups with antibodies of Leptospira spp were Sejroe, Hebdomadis, Grippotyphosa, Icterohaemorrhagie and Australis, which were detected in humans, cattle, goats and buffaloes; Sejroe and Grippotyphosa, which were detected in a lion; Australis, Icterohaemorrhagie and Grippotyphosa, which were detected in rodents; and Australis, which was detected in shrews. Antibodies to serogroup Ballum were detected only in humans. Conclusions The results of this study demonstrate that leptospiral antibodies are widely prevalent in humans, livestock and wildlife from the Katavi-Rukwa ecosystem. The disease poses a serious economic and public health threat in the study area. This epidemiological study provides information on circulating serogroups, which will be essential in designing intervention measures to reduce the risk of disease transmission.","[Assenga, Justine A.; Matemba, Lucas E.; Muller, Shabani K.; Kazwala, Rudovick R.] Sokoine Univ Agr, Dept Vet Med & Publ Hlth, Morogoro, Tanzania; [Matemba, Lucas E.] Natl Inst Med Res, Dar Es Salaam, Tanzania; [Mhamphi, Ginethon G.] Sokoine Univ Agr, Ctr Pest Management, Morogoro, Tanzania","Assenga, JA (reprint author), Sokoine Univ Agr, Dept Vet Med & Publ Hlth, Morogoro, Tanzania.",assengakanda@yahoo.com,,,"Wellcome trust through Afrique One Consortium, Sokoine University","The study was funded by Wellcome trust through Afrique One Consortium, Sokoine University.

Immunoproteomic characterization of Leishmania donovani proteins led to the identification of a novel protein NAD+-dependent Silent Information regulatory- 2 (SIR2 family or sirtuin) protein (LdSir2RP) as one of the potent immunostimulatory proteins. Proteins of the SIR2 family are characterized by a conserved catalytic domain that exerts unique NAD-dependent deacetylase activity. In the present study, an immunobiochemical characterization of LdSir2RP and further evaluation of its immunogenicity and prophylactic potential was done to assess for its possible involvement as a vaccine candidate against leishmaniasis. MethodologyPrincipal Findings LdSir2RP was successfully cloned, expressed and purified. The gene was present as a monomeric protein of similar to 45 kDa and further established by the crosslinking experiment. rLdSir2RP shown cytosolic localization in L. donovani and demonstrating NAD+-dependent deacetylase activity. Bioinformatic analysis also confirmed that LdSir2RP protein has NAD binding domain. The rLdSir2RP was further assessed for its cellular response by lymphoproliferative assay and cytokine ELISA in cured Leishmania patients and hamsters (Mesocricetus auratus) in comparison to soluble Leishmania antigen and it was observed to stimulate the production of IFN-gamma, IL-12 and TNF-alpha significantly but not the IL-4 and IL-10. The naive hamsters when vaccinated with rLdSir2RP alongwith BCG resisted the L. donovani challenge to the tune of similar to 75% and generated strong IL-12 and IFN-gamma mediated Th1 type immune response thereof. The efficacy was further supported by remarkable increase in IgG2 antibody level which is indicative of Th1 type of protective response. Further, with a possible implication in vaccine design against VL, identification of potential T-cell epitopes of rLdSir2RP was done using computational approach. Conclusion/Significance The immunobiochemical characterization strongly suggest the potential of rLdSir2RP as vaccine candidate against VL and supports the concept of its being effective T-cell stimulatory antigen.","[Baharia, Rajendra K.; Tandon, Rati; Das, Sanchita; Dube, Anuradha] CSIR Cent Drug Res Inst, Div Parasitol, Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh, India; [Sharma, Tanuj; Siddiqi, Mohammad Imran] CSIR Cent Drug Res Inst, Div Mol & Struct Biol, Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh, India; [Suthar, Manish K.; Saxena, Jitendra Kumar] CSIR Cent Drug Res Inst, Div Biochem, Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh, India; [Sunder, Shyam] Banaras Hindu Univ, Inst Med Sci, Dept Med, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India","Baharia, RK (reprint author), CSIR Cent Drug Res Inst, Div Parasitol, Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh, India.",anuradha_dube@hotmail.com,,,"Department of Biotechnology DBT [BT/PR11782/MED/29/113/2009 AD]; CSIR-CDRI's network [HOPE (BSC-0114)]; Council for Scientific and Industrial Research, New Delhi","This work was funded by the Department of Biotechnology DBT) BT/PR11782/MED/29/113/2009 AD and CSIR-CDRI's network project HOPE (BSC-0114).

Malaria global elimination efforts will benefit from accurate and effective genotyping tools that will provide insight into the population genetics and diversity of this parasite. The recent sequencing of P. vivax isolates from South America, Africa, and Asia presents a new opportunity by uncovering thousands of novel single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Genotyping a selection of these SNPs provides a robust, low-cost method of identifying parasite infections through their unique genetic signature or barcode. Based on our experience in generating a SNP barcode for P. falciparum using High Resolution Melting (HRM), we have developed a similar tool for P. vivax. We selected globally polymorphic SNPs from available P. vivax genome sequence data that were located in putatively selectively neutral sites (i.e., intergenic, intronic, or 4fold degenerate coding). From these candidate SNPs we defined a barcode consisting of 42 SNPs. We analyzed the performance of the 42-SNP barcode on 87 P. vivax clinical samples from parasite populations in South America (Brazil, French Guiana), Africa (Ethiopia) and Asia (Sri Lanka). We found that the P. vivax barcode is robust, as it requires only a small quantity of DNA (limit of detection 0.3 ng/mu l) to yield reproducible genotype calls, and detects polymorphic genotypes with high sensitivity. The markers are informative across all clinical samples evaluated (average minor allele frequency > 0.1). Population genetic and statistical analyses show the barcode captures high degrees of population diversity and differentiates geographically distinct populations. Our 42-SNP barcode provides a robust, informative, and standardized genetic marker set that accurately identifies a genomic signature for P. vivax infections.","[Baniecki, Mary Lynn; Schaffner, Stephen F.; Park, Daniel J.; Melnikov, Alexandre; Neafsey, Daniel E.; Volkman, Sarah K.; Wirth, Dyann F.; Sabeti, Pardis C.] Broad Inst, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA; [Faust, Aubrey L.; Daniels, Rachel F.; Sabeti, Pardis C.] Harvard Univ, Dept Organism & Evolutionary Biol, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Galinsky, Kevin; Hamilton, Elizabeth; Volkman, Sarah K.; Wirth, Dyann F.; Sabeti, Pardis C.] Harvard Univ, Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Immunol & Infect Dis, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Ferreira, Marcelo U.] Univ Sao Paulo, Dept Parasitol, Sao Paulo, Brazil; [Karunaweera, Nadira D.] Univ Colombo, Fac Med, Dept Parasitol, Colombo, Sri Lanka; [Serre, David] Cleveland Clin Lerner Res Inst, Dept Genom Med Inst, Cleveland, OH USA; [Zimmerman, Peter A.] Case Western Reserve Univ, Dept Int Hlth Biol & Genet, Cleveland, OH 44106 USA; [Sa, Juliana M.; Wellems, Thomas E.] Natl Inst Allergy & Infect Dis, Malaria Genet Sect, Lab Malaria & Vector Res, Rockville, MD USA; [Musset, Lise; Legrand, Eric] Inst Pasteur, Dept Parasitol, Cayenne, French Guiana; [Volkman, Sarah K.] Simmons Coll, Sch Nursing & Hlth Sci, Boston, MA 02115 USA","Baniecki, ML (reprint author), Broad Inst, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA.",baniecki@broadinstitute.org,"Schaffner, Stephen F/D-1189-2011; Ferreira, Marcelo/G-8289-2011; Ferreira, Marcelo U/Q-2860-2019; Daniels, Rachel/H-9467-2013","Ferreira, Marcelo/0000-0002-5293-9090; Ferreira, Marcelo U/0000-0002-5293-9090; Legrand, Eric/0000-0003-4725-0712; Karunaweera, Nadira/0000-0003-3985-1817; Galinsky, Kevin/0000-0003-0311-4938; Zimmerman, Peter/0000-0002-5349-4513; Daniels, Rachel/0000-0002-9712-4581","Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation; Common Fund of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health [NIH 1DP2OD006514-01]; Intramural Research Program of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health","This study is supported by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.

We describe possible and probable cases of infantile thiamine deficiency in northern Laos. Methodology/Principal Findings Three surveys were conducted in Luang Namtha Province. First, we performed a retrospective survey of all infants with a diagnosis of thiamine deficiency admitted to the 5 hospitals in the province (2007-2009). Second, we prospectively recorded all infants with cardiac failure at Luang Namtha Hospital. Third, we further investigated all mothers with infants (1-6 months) living in 22 villages of the thiamine deficiency patients' origin. We performed a cross-sectional survey of all mothers and infants using a pre-tested questionnaire, physical examination and squat test. Infant mortality was estimated by verbal autopsy. From March to June 2010, four suspected infants with thiamine deficiency were admitted to Luang Namtha Provincial hospital. All recovered after parenteral thiamine injection. Between 2007 and 2009, 54 infants with possible/probable thiamine deficiency were diagnosed with acute severe cardiac failure, 49 (90.2%) were cured after parenteral thiamine; three died (5.6%). In the 22 villages, of 468 live born infants, 50 (10.6%, 95% CI: 8.0-13.8) died during the first year. A peak of mortality (36 deaths) was reported between 1 and 3 months. Verbal autopsy suggested that 17 deaths (3.6%) were due to suspected infantile thiamine deficiency. Of 127 mothers, 60 (47.2%) reported edema and paresthesia as well as a positive squat test during pregnancy; 125 (98.4%) respected post-partum food avoidance and all ate polished rice. Of 127 infants, 2 (1.6%) had probable thiamine deficiency, and 8 (6.8%) possible thiamine deficiency. Conclusion Thiamine deficiency may be a major cause of infant mortality among ethnic groups in northern Laos. Mothers' and children's symptoms are compatible with thiamine deficiency. The severity of this nutritional situation requires urgent attention in Laos.","[Barennes, Hubert] Agence Natl Rech VIH & Hepatites, Phnom Penh, Cambodia; [Barennes, Hubert; Sengkhamyong, Khouanheuan; Rene, Jean Pascal; Phimmasane, Maniphet] Inst Francophonie Med Trop, PDR, Viangchan, Laos; [Barennes, Hubert] Inst Pasteur, Epidemiol Unit, Phnom Penh, Cambodia; [Barennes, Hubert] Univ Bordeaux, ISPED, Ctr INSERM, Epidemiol Biostat U897, Bordeaux, France","Barennes, H (reprint author), Agence Natl Rech VIH & Hepatites, Phnom Penh, Cambodia.",barenneshub@yahoo.fr,,,"Institut Francophone pour la Medecine Tropicale (IFMT, Vientiane, Laos)","This work was part of a master's study (KS) by ""Institut Francophone pour la Medecine Tropicale"" (IFMT, Vientiane, Laos).

We investigated the epidemiologic characteristics of urban immigrants and natives living in a neighborhood of Salvador, Brazil where there is a focus of transmission of Schistosoma mansoni. In a cross-sectional study, all inhabitants from 3 sections of the community were interviewed and examined. In order to determine the degree of parasite differentiation between immigrants and the native born, S. mansoni eggs from stools were genotyped for 15 microsatellite markers. The area received migrants from all over the state, but most infected children had never been outside of the city, and infected snails were present at water contact sites. Other epidemiologic features suggested immigration contributed little to the presence of infection. The intensity and prevalence of infection were the same for immigrants and natives when adjusted for age, and length of immigrant residence in the community was positively associated with prevalence of infection. The population structure of the parasites also supported that the contribution from immigration was small, since the host-to-host differentiation was no greater in the urban parasite population than a rural population with little distant immigration, and there had been little differentiation in the urban population over the past 7 years. Public health efforts should focus on eliminating local transmission, and once eliminated, reintroduction from distant migration is unlikely.","[Blanton, Ronald E.; Aminu, Peace T.; Blank, Walter A.] Case Western Reserve Univ, Ctr Global Hlth & Dis, Cleveland, OH 44106 USA; [Barbosa, Lucio M.; Reis, Eliana A.; Carmo, Theomira M.; dos Santos, Claudio R.

The disease has been reported in many countries of Africa, Asia, the Middle East, and in Eurasia. During the past decade, new foci of CCHF have emerged in the Balkan Peninsula, southwest Russia, the Middle East, western China, India, Africa, and Turkey. CCHF virus produces severe hemorrhagic manifestations in humans with fatality rates up to 30%. Vaccine development efforts have been significantly hampered by a lack of animal models and therefore, no protective vaccine has been achieved. Lately, IFN alpha/beta receptor deficient (IFNAR(-/-)) mice have been established as a novel small animal model of CCHF virus infection. In the present study, we found that IFNAR(-/-) mice highly susceptible to CCHF virus Turkey-Kelkit06 strain. Immunization with the cell culture based vaccine elicited a significant level of protection against high dose challenge (1,000 PPFU) with a homologous CCHF virus in IFNAR(-/-) mice.","[Canakoglu, Nurettin; Ozdarendeli, Aykut] Erciyes Univ, Fac Med, Dept Microbiol, Kayseri, Turkey; [Canakoglu, Nurettin; Berber, Engin; Tonbak, Sukru; Ozdarendeli, Aykut] Firat Univ, Dept Virol, Coll Vet Med, TR-23169 Elazig, Turkey; [Berber, Engin; Sozdutmaz, Ibrahim] Erciyes Univ, Coll Vet Med, Dept Virol, Kayseri, Turkey; [Ertek, Mustafa] Refik Saydam Natl Publ Hlth Agcy, Ankara, Turkey; [Aktas, Munir] Firat Univ, Coll Vet Med, Dept Parasitol, TR-23169 Elazig, Turkey; [Kalkan, Ahmet] Karadeniz Tech Univ, Fac Med, Dept Infect Dis & Clin Microbiol, Trabzon, Turkey","Canakoglu, N (reprint author), Erciyes Univ, Fac Med, Dept Microbiol, Kayseri, Turkey.",aozdarendeli@erciyes.edu.tr,"tonbak, sukru/W-2199-2018; sozdutmaz, ibrahim/I-7358-2015; Aktas, Munir/K-3143-2016","sozdutmaz, ibrahim/0000-0002-3712-7991; Aktas, Munir/0000-0002-3188-8757",Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey (TUBITAK) [108G126],"This research was financially supported and approved by the Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey (TUBITAK), project number 108G126.

Its geographical expansion and the increase in the number of human cases has been linked to dispersion of Lutzomyia longipalpis into urban areas. To produce more accurate risk maps we investigated the geographic distribution and routes of expansion of the disease as well as chemotype populations of the vector. Methodology/Principal Findings A database, containing the annual records of municipalities which had notified human and canine AVL cases as well as the presence of the vector, was compiled. The chemotypes of L. longipalpis populations from municipalities in different regions of Sao Paulo State were determined by Coupled Gas Chromatography - Mass Spectrometry. From 1997 to June 2014, L. longipalpis has been reported in 166 municipalities, 148 of them in the Western region. A total of 106 municipalities were identified with transmission and 99 were located in the Western region, where all 2,204 autochthonous human cases occurred. Both the vector and the occurrence of human cases have expanded in a South-easterly direction, from the Western to central region, and from there, a further expansion to the North and the South. The (S)-9-methylgermacrene-B population of L. longipalpis is widely distributed in the Western region and the cembrene-1 population is restricted to the Eastern region. Conclusion/Significance The maps in the present study show that there are two distinct epidemiological patterns of AVL in Sao Paulo State and that the expansion of human and canine AVL cases through the Western region has followed the same dispersion route of only one of the two species of the L. longipalpis complex, (S)-9-methylgermacrene-B. Entomological vigilance based on the routes of dispersion and identification of the chemotype population could be used to identify at-risk areas and consequently define the priorities for control measures.","[Casanova, Claudio] Secretaria Estado Saude Sao Paulo, Superintendencia Controle Endemias, Sao Paulo, Brazil; [Colla-Jacques, Fernanda E.] Univ Estadual Campinas, Inst Biol, Dept Biol Anim, Sao Paulo, Brazil; [Hamilton, James G.

Here, we report that the stinging nettle lectin (UDA), with predominant N-acetylglucosamine-binding specificity, interacts with glycosylated VSGs and kills parasites by provoking defects in endocytosis together with impaired cytokinesis. Prolonged exposure to UDA induced parasite resistance based on a diminished capacity to bind the lectin due to an enrichment of biantennary paucimannose and a reduction of triantennary oligomannose structures. Two molecular mechanisms involved in resistance were identified: VSG switching and modifications in N-glycan composition. Glycosylation defects were correlated with the down-regulation of the TbSTT3A and/or TbSTT3B genes (coding for oligosaccharyltransferases A and B, respectively) responsible for glycan specificity. Furthermore, UDA-resistant trypanosomes exhibited severely impaired infectivity indicating that the resistant phenotype entails a substantial fitness cost. The results obtained further support the modification of surface glycan composition resulting from down-regulation of the genes coding for oligosaccharyltransferases as a general resistance mechanism in response to prolonged exposure to carbohydrate-binding agents.","[Castillo-Acosta, Victor M.; Ruiz-Perez, Luis M.; Gonzalez-Pacanowska, Dolores] CSIC, Inst Parasitol & Biomed Lopez Neyra, Granada, Spain; [Van Damme, Els J.

P. vivax strains grown in monkeys serve as a renewable source of parasites for in vitro and ex vivo experimental studies and functional assays, or for studying in vivo the relapse characteristics, mosquito species compatibilities, drug susceptibility profiles or immune responses towards potential vaccine candidates. Despite the importance of these studies, little is known as to how adaptation to a different host species may influence the genome of P. vivax. In addition, it is unclear whether these monkey-adapted strains consist of a single clonal population of parasites or if they retain the multiclonal complexity commonly observed in field isolates. Here we compare the genome sequences of seven P. vivax strains adapted to New World monkeys with those of six human clinical isolates collected directly in the field. We show that the adaptation of P. vivax parasites to monkey hosts, and their subsequent propagation, did not result in significant modifications of their genome sequence and that these monkey-adapted strains recapitulate the genomic diversity of field isolates. Our analyses also reveal that these strains are not always genetically homogeneous and should be analyzed cautiously. Overall, our study provides a framework to better leverage this important research material and fully utilize this resource for improving our understanding of P. vivax biology.","[Chan, Ernest R.; Serre, David] Cleveland Clin Lerner Res Inst, Genom Med Inst, Cleveland, OH 44195 USA; [Chan, Ernest R.; Zimmerman, Peter A.] Case Western Reserve Univ, Ctr Global Hlth & Dis, Cleveland, OH 44106 USA; [Barnwell, John W.] Ctr Dis Control & Prevent, Ctr Global Hlth, Div Parasit Dis & Malaria, Malaria Branch, Atlanta, GA USA","Chan, ER (reprint author), Cleveland Clin Lerner Res Inst, Genom Med Inst, Cleveland, OH 44195 USA.",serred@ccf.org,,"Zimmerman, Peter/0000-0002-5349-4513",Cleveland CTSC Pilot award; National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) [R01 AI103228]; NIAID [R21 AI093922]; T32 Postdoctoral Fellowship in Geographic Medicine and Infectious Disease [AI007024],"This work was funded by a Cleveland CTSC Pilot award and a National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) award (R01 AI103228) to DS and a NIAID award (R21 AI093922) to PAZ.

The polymorphic nature of DBP induces strain-specific immune responses that pose unique challenges for vaccine development. DEKnull is a synthetic DBP based antigen that has been engineered through mutation to enhance induction of blocking inhibitory antibodies. We determined the x-ray crystal structure of DEKnull to identify if any conformational changes had occurred upon mutation. Computational and experimental analyses assessed immunogenicity differences between DBP and DEKnull epitopes. Functional binding assays with monoclonal antibodies were used to interrogate the available epitopes in DEKnull. We demonstrate that DEKnull is structurally similar to the parental Sal1 DBP. The DEKnull mutations do not cause peptide backbone shifts within the polymorphic loop, or at either the DBP dimerization interface or DARC receptor binding pockets, two important structurally conserved protective epitope motifs. All B-cell epitopes, except for the mutated DEK motif, are conserved between DEKnull and DBP. The DEKnull protein retains binding to conformationally dependent inhibitory antibodies. DEKnull is an iterative improvement of DBP as a vaccine candidate. DEKnull has reduced immunogenicity to polymorphic regions responsible for strain-specific immunity while retaining conserved protein folds necessary for induction of strain-transcending blocking inhibitory antibodies.","[Chen, Edwin; Salinas, Nichole D.; Tolia, Niraj H.] Washington Univ, Sch Med, Dept Mol Microbiol & Microbial Pathogenesis, St Louis, MO 63130 USA; [Ntumngia, Francis B.; Adams, John H.] Univ S Florida, Coll Publ Hlth, Dept Global Hlth, Global Hlth Infect Dis Res, Tampa, FL USA; [Tolia, Niraj H.] Washington Univ, Sch Med, Dept Biochem & Mol Biophys, St Louis, MO 63110 USA","Chen, E (reprint author), Washington Univ, Sch Med, Dept Mol Microbiol & Microbial Pathogenesis, St Louis, MO 63130 USA.",tolia@wustl.edu,"Tolia, Niraj/D-2332-2014; Adams, John/G-1800-2015","Tolia, Niraj/0000-0002-2689-1337; Adams, John/0000-0003-3707-7979; Ntumngia, Francis/0000-0001-9867-3534","National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases at the National Institutes of Health [R01 AI080792, R01 AI064478, T32 AI007172]; Edward Mallinckrodt, Jr. Foundation; Burroughs Wellcome Fund; Schlesinger graduate student award","This work was supported by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases at the National Institutes of Health [grant numbers R01 AI080792 to NHT, R01 AI064478 to JHA and NHT, and T32 AI007172 to EC], the Edward Mallinckrodt, Jr. Foundation to NHT, the Burroughs Wellcome Fund to NHT, and a Schlesinger graduate student award to EC.

Glycolytic enzymes are recognized as crucial molecules for trematode survival and have been targeted for vaccine and drug development. Hexokinase of C. sinensis (CsHK), as the first key regulatory enzyme of the glycolytic pathway, was investigated in the current study. Principal Findings There were differences in spatial structure and affinities for hexoses and phosphate donors between CsHK and HKs from humans or rats, the definitive hosts of C. sinensis. Effectors (AMP, PEP, and citrate) and a small molecular inhibitor regulated the enzymatic activity of rCsHK, and various allosteric systems were detected. CsHK was distributed in the worm extensively as well as in liver tissue and serum from C. sinensis infected rats. Furthermore, high-level specific IgG1 and IgG2a were induced in rats by immunization with rCsHK. The enzymatic activity of CsHK was suppressed by the antibody in vitro. Additionally, the survival of C. sinensis was inhibited by the antibody in vivo and in vitro. Conclusions/Significance Due to differences in putative spatial structure and enzymology between CsHK and HK from the host, its extensive distribution in adult worms, and its expression profile as a component of excretory/secretory products, together with its good immunogenicity and immunoreactivity, as a key glycolytic enzyme, CsHK shows potential as a vaccine and as a promising drug target for Clonorchiasis.","[Chen, Tingjin; Yu, Jinyun; Tang, Zeli; Xie, Zhizhi; Lin, Zhipeng; Sun, Hengchang; Wan, Shuo; Li, Xuerong; Huang, Yan; Yu, Xinbing; Xu, Jin] Sun Yat Sen Univ, Zhongshan Sch Med, Dept Parasitol, Guangzhou 510275, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Chen, Tingjin; Yu, Jinyun; Tang, Zeli; Xie, Zhizhi; Lin, Zhipeng; Sun, Hengchang; Wan, Shuo; Li, Xuerong; Huang, Yan; Yu, Xinbing; Xu, Jin] Sun Yat Sen Univ, Minist Educ, Key Lab Trop Dis Control, Guangzhou 510275, Guangdong, Peoples R China","Chen, TJ (reprint author), Sun Yat Sen Univ, Zhongshan Sch Med, Dept Parasitol, Guangzhou 510275, Guangdong, Peoples R China.",huang66@mail.sysu.edu.cn; yuxb@mail.sysu.edu.cn; xujin@mail.sysu.edu.cn,,,"National S & T Major Program [2012ZX10004-220]; National Key Basic Research and Development Project (973 project) [2010CB530000]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [81101270, 81171602]","This work was supported by the National S & T Major Program (2012ZX10004-220 to XY), the National Key Basic Research and Development Project (973 project; No. 2010CB530000 to XY), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 81101270 to YH and No. 81171602 to XY), The funders had no role in study design, data collection and analysis, decision to publish, or preparation of the manuscript.",,55,8,9,0,9,PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE,SAN FRANCISCO,"1160 BATTERY STREET, STE 100, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94111 USA",1935-2735,,,PLOS NEGLECT TROP D,Plos Neglect.

In most cases, flavivirus diagnosis in travelers is primarily based on serology as viremia is often low and typically has already been reduced to undetectable levels when symptoms set in and patients seek medical attention. Serological differentiation between flaviviruses and the false-positive results caused by vaccination and cross-reactivity among the different species, are problematic for surveillance and diagnostics of flaviviruses. Their partially overlapping geographic distribution and symptoms, combined with increase in travel, and preexisting antibodies due to flavivirus vaccinations, expand the need for rapid and reliable multiplex diagnostic tests to supplement currently used methods. Goal We describe the development of a multiplex serological protein microarray using recombinant NS1 proteins for detection of medically important viruses within the genus Flavivirus. Sera from clinical flavivirus patients were used for primary development of the protein microarray. Results Results show a high IgG and IgM sensitivity and specificity for individual NS1 antigens, and limited cross reactivity, even within serocomplexes. In addition, the serology based on this array allows for discrimination between infection and vaccination response for JEV vaccine, and no cross-reactivity with TBEV and YFV vaccine induced antibodies when testing for antibodies to other flaviviruses. Conclusion Based on these data, multiplex NS1-based protein microarray is a promising tool for surveillance and diagnosis of flaviviruses.","[Cleton, Natalie B.; Beersma, Mathias F.; Goeijenbier, Marco; Koopmans, Marion P.

This study has been carried out to assess the performance of this Platelia Dengue IgA Capture assay for dengue infection detection. A total of 184 well-characterized samples provided by the French Guiana NRC sera collection (Laboratory of Virology, Institut Pasteur in French Guiana) were selected among samples collected between 2002 and 2013 from patients exhibiting a dengue-like syndrome. A first group included 134 sera from confirmed dengue-infected patients, and a second included 50 sera from non-dengue infected patients, all collected between day 3 and day 15 after the onset of fever. Dengue infection diagnoses were all confirmed using reference assays by direct virological identification using RT-PCR or virus culture on acute sera samples or on paired acute-phase sera samples of selected convalescent sera. This study revealed: i) a good overall sensitivity and specificity of the IgA index test, i.e., 93% and 88% respectively, indicating its good correlation to acute dengue diagnosis; and ii) a good concordance with the Panbio IgM capture ELISA. Because of the shorter persistence of dengue virus-specific IgA than IgM, these results underlined the relevance of this new test, which could significantly improve dengue diagnosis accuracy, especially in countries where dengue virus is (hyper-) endemic. It would allow for additional refinement of dengue diagnostic strategy.","[De Decker, Sophie; Sistek, Viridiana; Labeau, Bhety; Enfissi, Antoine; Rousset, Dominique; Matheus, Severine] Inst Pasteur, Laboratoire Virol, Cayenne, Guyane Francais, France; [Vray, Muriel] Inst Pasteur, Epidemiol Malad Emergentes, Paris, France","De Decker, S (reprint author), Inst Pasteur, Laboratoire Virol, Cayenne, Guyane Francais, France.",sdedecker@pasteur-cayenne.fr; smatheus@pasteur-cayenne.fr,"Vray, Muriel/M-7947-2018; Rousset, Dominique/S-5400-2019","Rousset, Dominique/0000-0002-1473-3147",European grant [REGPOT-CT-2011-285837-STRONGER],"This work has benefited from a European grant managed by European Commission (REGPOT-CT-2011-285837-STRONGER).

Chikungunya fever cases have also been reported in Nepal, and the virus causing this disease is also transmitted by these mosquito species. Here we report the results of a study on the risk factors for the presence of chikungunya and dengue virus vectors, their elevational ceiling of distribution, and climatic determinants of their abundance in central Nepal. Methodology/Principal Findings We collected immature stages of mosquitoes during six monthly cross-sectional surveys covering six administrative districts along an altitudinal transect in central Nepal that extended from Birgunj (80 m above sea level [asl]) to Dhunche (highest altitude sampled: 2,100 m asl). The dengue vectors Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus were commonly found up to 1,350 m asl in Kathmandu valley and were present but rarely found from 1,750 to 2,100 m asl in Dhunche. The lymphatic filariasis vector Culex quinquefasciatus was commonly found throughout the study transect. Physiographic region, month of collection, collection station and container type were significant predictors of the occurrence and co-occurrence of Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus. The climatic variables rainfall, temperature, and relative humidity were significant predictors of chikungunya and dengue virus vectors abundance. Conclusions/Significance We conclude that chikungunya and dengue virus vectors have already established their populations up to the High Mountain region of Nepal and that this may be attributed to the environmental and climate change that has been observed over the decades in Nepal. The rapid expansion of the distribution of these important disease vectors in the High Mountain region, previously considered to be non-endemic for dengue and chikungunya fever, calls for urgent actions to protect the health of local people and tourists travelling in the central Himalayas.","[Dhimal, Meghnath; Joshi, Hari Datt] Minist Hlth & Populat Complex, NHRC, Kathmandu, Nepal; [Dhimal, Meghnath; O'Hara, Robert B.; Ahrens, Bodo] Senckenberg Gesell Naturforsch, Biodivers & Climate Res Ctr BiK F, Frankfurt, Germany; [Dhimal, Meghnath; Ahrens, Bodo] Goethe Univ Frankfurt, Inst Atmospher & Environm Sci IAU, D-60054 Frankfurt, Germany; [Dhimal, Meghnath; Kuch, Ulrich] Goethe Univ Frankfurt, Inst Occupat Med Social Med & Environm Med, D-60054 Frankfurt, Germany; [Gautam, Ishan] Tribhuvan Univ, Nat Hist Museum, Kathmandu, Nepal","Dhimal, M (reprint author), Minist Hlth & Populat Complex, NHRC, Kathmandu, Nepal.",meghdhimal@gmail.com,"O'Hara, Bob/A-7499-2008; Ahrens, Bodo/A-7439-2008","O'Hara, Bob/0000-0001-9737-3724; Ahrens, Bodo/0000-0002-6452-3180","Government of Nepal; DAAD; Ministry of Higher Education, Research and the Arts of the State of Hesse, Germany","This research was performed as a part of the collaborative research project ""A longitudinal study on Aedes mosquitoes and climate change along an altitudinal transect in central Nepal"" by the Nepal Health Research Council (NHRC) and the Biodiversity and Climate Research Centre (BiK-F).

These related trematodes are responsible for the chronic neglected tropical diseases schistosomiasis and fascioliasis, respectively. As no vaccine is currently available for anti-flukicidal immunoprophylaxis, current treatment is mediated by mono-chemical chemotherapy in the form of mass drug administration (MDA) (praziquantel for schistosomiasis) or drenching (triclabendazole for fascioliasis) programmes. This overreliance on single chemotherapeutic classes has dramatically limited the number of novel chemical entities entering anthelmintic drug discovery pipelines, raising significant concerns for the future of sustainable blood and liver fluke control. Methodology/Principle Findings Here we demonstrate that 7-keto-sempervirol, a diterpenoid isolated from Lycium chinense, has dual anthelmintic activity against related S. mansoni and F. hepatica trematodes. Using a microtiter plate-based helminth fluorescent bioassay (HFB), this activity is specific (Therapeutic index = 4.2, when compared to HepG2 cell lines) and moderately potent (LD50 = 19.1 mu M) against S. mansoni schistosomula cultured in vitro. This anti-schistosomula effect translates into activity against both adult male and female schistosomes cultured in vitro where 7-keto-sempervirol negatively affects motility/behaviour, surface architecture (inducing tegumental holes, tubercle swelling and spine loss/shortening), oviposition rates and egg morphology. As assessed by the HFB and microscopic phenotypic scoring matrices, 7-keto-sempervirol also effectively kills in vitro cultured F. hepatica newly excysted juveniles (NEJs, LD50 = 17.7 mu M). Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) evaluation of adult F. hepatica liver flukes co-cultured in vitro with 7-keto-sempervirol additionally demonstrates phenotypic abnormalities including breaches in tegumental integrity and spine loss. Conclusions/Significance 7-keto-sempervirol negatively affects the viability and phenotype of two related pathogenic trematodes responsible for significant human and animal infectious diseases. This plant-derived, natural product is also active against both larval and adult developmental forms. As such, the data collectively indicate that 7-keto-sempervirol is an important starting point for anthelmintic drug development. Medicinal chemistry optimisation of more potent 7-keto-sempervirol analogues could lead to the identification of novel chemical entities useful for future combinatorial or replacement anthelmintic control.","[Edwards, Jennifer; Brown, Martha; Peak, Emily; Hoffmann, Karl F.] Aberystwyth Univ, Inst Biol Environm & Rural Sci IBERS, Aberystwyth SY23 3FG, Dyfed, Wales; [Bartholomew, Barbara; Nash, Robert J.] Phytoquest Ltd, Plas Gogerddan, Aberystwyth, Dyfed, Wales","Edwards, J (reprint author), Aberystwyth Univ, Inst Biol Environm & Rural Sci IBERS, Aberystwyth SY23 3FG, Dyfed, Wales.",krh@aber.ac.uk,,,Welsh Government Knowledge Economy Skills Scholarship (KESS); Academia for Business (A4B) schemes as well as the BBSRC Follow On Fund [BB/I532937/1]; Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council [BB/I532937/1],"We thank the Welsh Government Knowledge Economy Skills Scholarship (KESS) and Academia for Business (A4B) schemes as well as the BBSRC Follow On Fund (BB/I532937/1) for financially supporting this work.

Samples were screened for Cryptosporidium spp. by PCR and isolates were classified into subtypes based on sequence differences in the gp60 gene. Subtype specific frequencies for age, sex, location and season have been determined and associations with disease symptoms have been analysed within a case-control study. Cryptosporidium infections were diagnosed in 116 of 2232 (5.2%) stool samples. Subtyping of 88 isolates revealed IIcA5G3 (n = 26, 29.6%), IbA13G3 (n = 17, 19.3%) and IaA21R3 (n = 12, 13.6%) as the three most frequent subtypes of the two species C. hominis and C. parvum, known to be transmitted anthroponotically. Infections peak at early rainy season with 67.9% and 50.0% of infections during the months April, May and June for 2007 and 2008 respectively. C. hominis infection was mainly associated with diarrhoea (odds ratio [OR] = 2.4; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.2-4.9) whereas C. parvum infection was associated with both diarrhoea (OR = 2.6; CI: 1.2-5.8) and vomiting (OR = 3.1; 95% CI: 1.5-6.1). Conclusions/Significance Cryptosporidiosis is characterized by seasonal anthroponotic transmission of strains typically found in Sub-Saharan Africa. The infection mainly affects young infants, with vomiting and diarrhoea being one of the leading symptoms in C. parvum infection. Combining molecular typing and clinical data provides valuable information for physicians and is able to track sources of infections.","[Eibach, Daniel; Krumkamp, Ralf; Al-Emran, Hassan M.; Tannich, Egbert; May, Juergen] Bernhard Nocht Inst Trop Med, D-20359 Hamburg, Germany; [Eibach, Daniel; Krumkamp, Ralf; Tannich, Egbert; May, Juergen] German Ctr Infect Res DZIF, Lubeck, Germany; [Sarpong, Nimako] Kumasi Ctr Collaborat Res Trop Med KCCR, Kumasi, Ghana; [Hagen, Ralf Matthias] German Armed Forces Hosp Hamburg, BNITM, Dept Trop Med, Hamburg, Germany; [Adu-Sarkodie, Yaw] KNUST, Kumasi, Ghana","Eibach, D (reprint author), Bernhard Nocht Inst Trop Med, Bernhard Nocht Str 74, D-20359 Hamburg, Germany.",eibach@bnitm.de,,,"UBS Optimus Foundation; German Center for Infection Research (Deutsches Zentrum fur Infektionsforschung, DZIF)","This work was supported by the UBS Optimus Foundation and by the German Center for Infection Research (Deutsches Zentrum fur Infektionsforschung, DZIF).

The major causative organism is the fungus Madurella mycetomatis. The current treatment of eumycetoma is suboptimal and characterized by low cure rate and high recurrence rates. Hence, an alternative therapy is needed to address this. Here we determined the antifungal activity of seven Sudanese medicinal plant species against Madurella mycetomatis. Of these, only three species; Boswellia papyrifera, Acacia nubica and Nigella sativa, showed some antifungal activity against M. mycetomatis and were further studied. Crude methanol, hexane and defatted methanol extracts of these species were tested for their antifungal activity. B. papyrifera had the highest antifungal activity (MIC50 of 1 mu g/ml) and it was further fractionated. The crude methanol and the soluble ethyl acetate fractions of B. papyrifera showed some antifungal activity. The Gas-Liquid-Chromatography hybrid Mass-Spectrophotometer analysis of these two fractions showed the existence of beta-amyrin, beta-amyrone, beta-Sitosterol and stigmatriene. Stigmatriene had the best antifungal activity, compared to other three phytoconstituents, with an MIC-50 of 32 mu g/ml. Although the antifungal activity of the identified phytoconstituents was only limited, the antifungal activity of the complete extracts is more promising, indicating synergism. Furthermore these plant extracts are also known to have antiinflammatory activity and can stimulate wound-healing; characteristics which might also be of great value in the development of novel therapeutic drugs for this chronic inflammatory disease. Therefore further exploration of these plant species in the treatment of mycetoma is encouraging.","[Elfadil, Hassabelrasoul] Univ Gezira, Fac Pharm, Dept Pharmaceut, Div Pharmaceut Microbiol, Gezira, Sudan; [Fahal, Ahmed] Univ Khartoum, Mycetoma Res Ctr, Khartoum, Sudan; [Kloezen, Wendy; van de Sande, Wendy] Erasmus MC, Dept Med Microbiol & Infect Dis, Rotterdam, Netherlands; [Ahmed, Elhadi M.] Univ Gezira, Fac Pharm, Dept Pharmacognosy, Gezira, Sudan","Elfadil, H (reprint author), Univ Gezira, Fac Pharm, Dept Pharmaceut, Div Pharmaceut Microbiol, Gezira, Sudan.",ahfahal@hotmail.com,,"Fahal, Ahmed/0000-0003-4922-7321; van de Sande, Wendy/0000-0002-8652-8783",,,,40,4,4,0,6,PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE,SAN FRANCISCO,"1160 BATTERY STREET, STE 100, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94111 USA",1935-2735,,,PLOS NEGLECT TROP D,Plos Neglect.

Nevertheless, parasites commonly exploit their vectors (nutritionally for example) so these can be considered a form of host. Trypanosoma cruzi, a protozoan found in mammals and triatomine bugs in the Americas, is the etiological agent of Chagas disease that affects man and domestic animals. While it has long been considered avirulent to its vectors, a few reports have indicated that it can affect triatomine fecundity. We tested whether infection imposed a temperature-dependent cost on triatomine fitness. We held infected insects at four temperatures between 21 and 30 degrees C and measured T. cruzi growth in vitro at the same temperatures in parallel. Trypanosoma cruzi infection caused a considerable delay in the time the insects took to moult (against a background effect of temperature accelerating moult irrespective of infection status). Trypanosoma cruzi also reduced the insects' survival, but only at the intermediate temperatures of 24 and 27 degrees C (against a background of increased mortality with increasing temperatures). Meanwhile, in vitro growth of T. cruzi increased with temperature. Our results demonstrate virulence of a protozoan agent of human disease to its insect vector under these conditions. It is of particular note that parasite-induced mortality was greatest over the range of temperatures normally preferred by these insects, probably implying adaptation of the parasite to perform well at these temperatures. Therefore we propose that triggering this delay in moulting is adaptive for the parasites, as it will delay the next blood-meal taken by the bug, thus allowing the parasites time to develop and reach the insect rectum in order to make transmission to a new vertebrate host possible.","[Elliot, Simon L.] Univ Fed Vicosa, Dept Entomol, Vicosa, MG, Brazil; [Rodrigues, Juliana de O.; Lorenzo, Marcelo G.; Martins-Filho, Olindo A.; Guarneri, Alessandra A.] Fiocruz MS, Ctr Pesquisas Rene Rachou, BR-30190 Belo Horizonte, MG, Brazil","Elliot, SL (reprint author), Univ Fed Vicosa, Dept Entomol, Campus Univ, Vicosa, MG, Brazil.",guarneri@cpqrr.fiocruz.br,"Elliot, Simon/A-5557-2013; guarneri, Alessandra A/I-4124-2012; Carvalho, Claudine/J-6347-2014; Lorenzo, Marcelo Gustavo/V-3951-2019","Lorenzo, Marcelo Gustavo/0000-0002-4000-5514; Guarneri, Alessandra/0000-0002-9162-2731",CNPq; FAPEMIG (Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Minas Gerais); CNPq (Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico); INCTEM/CNPq (Instituto Nacional de Ciencia e Tecnologia em Entomologia Molecular); FIOCRUZ/CPqRR (Fundacao Oswaldo Cruz/Centro de Pesquisas Rene Rachou); PAPES VI/FIOCRUZ (Programa Estrategico de Apoio a Pesquisa em Saude),"SLE, OAM and MGL were supported by CNPq productivity grants.

Mycetoma of the head and neck is a rarity and is associated with high morbidity and even mortality if not treated early. In this communication we report on 49 patients with head and neck mycetoma followed up at the Mycetoma Research Centre in Khartoum. Most of the reported patients had actinomycetoma and the majority were young adult males from mycetoma endemic areas in the Sudan. Most of them were students, farmers and workers. Prior to presentation the majority had long disease duration and the cause was multifactorial. Advanced disease with massive lesion, deformity and disability was the common presentation. There was no obvious history of local trauma, familial tendency or other predisposing factor identified in this group of patients. MRI and CT scan were the most accurate diagnostic tools to determine the disease extent. The treatment outcome was rather poor and characterised by low cure rate, poor outcome and high follows-up dropout.

The patients were predominately young (64% under 30 years old) males (76%). The majority (68%) were from the Sudan mycetoma belt and 28% were students. Madurella mycetomatis eumycetoma was the most common type (70%). In 66% of the patients the duration of the disease was less than five years, and 81% gave a history of sinuses discharging mostly black grains (78%). History of trauma at the mycetoma site was reported in 20%. Local pain was reported in 27% of the patients, and only 12% had a family history of mycetoma. The study showed that 57% of the patients had previous surgical excisions and recurrence, and only 4% received previous medical treatment for mycetoma. Other concomitant medical diseases were reported in 4% of the patients. The foot (76%) and hand (8%) were the most commonly affected sites. Less frequently affected sites were the leg and knee (7%), thigh (2%), buttock (2%) and arm and forearm (1%). Rare sites included the chest wall, head and neck, back, abdominal wall, perineum, oral cavity, tongue and eye. Multiple sites mycetoma was recorded in 135 (2%) of cases. At presentation, 37% of patients had massive lesions, 79% had sinuses, 8% had local hyper-hydrosis at the mycetoma lesion, 11% had regional lymphadenopathy, while 6% had dilated tortuous veins proximal to the mycetoma lesions. The diagnosis of mycetoma was established by combined imaging techniques and cytological, histopathological, serological tests and grain culture. Patients with actinomycetoma received a combination of antimicrobial agents, while eumycetoma patients received antifungal agents combined with various surgical excisions.

During Leishmania braziliensis infection, depletion of inflammatory cells significantly increases the parasite load whereas co-inoculation of neutrophils plus L. braziliensis had an opposite effect. Moreover, the co-culture of infected macrophages and neutrophils also induced parasite killing leading us to ask how neutrophils alone respond to an L. braziliensis exposure. Herein we focused on understanding the interaction between neutrophils and L. braziliensis, exploring cell activation and apoptotic fate. Methods and Findings Inoculation of serum-opsonized L. braziliensis promastigotes in mice induced neutrophil accumulation in vivo, peaking at 24 h. In vitro, exposure of thyoglycollate-elicited inflammatory or bone marrow neutrophils to L. braziliensis modulated the expression of surface molecules such as CD18 and CD62L, and induced the oxidative burst. Using mCherry-expressing L. braziliensis, we determined that such effects were mainly observed in infected and not in bystander cells. Neutrophil activation following contact with L. braziliensis was also confirmed by the release of TNF-alpha and neutrophil elastase. Lastly, neutrophils infected with L. braziliensis but not with L. major displayed markers of early apoptosis. Conclusions We show that L. braziliensis induces neutrophil recruitment in vivo and that neutrophils exposed to the parasite in vitro respond through activation and release of inflammatory mediators. This outcome may impact on parasite elimination, particularly at the early stages of infection.","[Falcao, Sarah A.

Here we investigated whether genetic recombination between subspecies of the protozoan parasite, Trypanosoma brucei, from humans and animals can generate new strains of human pathogen, T. b. rhodesiense (Tbr) responsible for sleeping sickness (Human African Trypanosomiasis, HAT) in East Africa. The trait of human infectivity in Tbr is conferred by a single gene, SRA, which is potentially transferable to the animal pathogen Tbb by sexual reproduction. We tracked the inheritance of SRA in crosses of Tbr and Tbb set up by co-transmitting genetically-engineered fluorescent parental trypanosome lines through tsetse flies. SRA was readily transferred into new genetic backgrounds by sexual reproduction between Tbr and Tbb, thus creating new strains of the human pathogen, Tbr. There was no evidence of diminished growth or transmissibility of hybrid trypanosomes carrying SRA. Although expression of SRA is critical to survival of Tbr in the human host, we show that the gene exists as a single copy in a representative collection of Tbr strains. SRA was found on one homologue of chromosome IV in the majority of Tbr isolates examined, but some Ugandan Tbr had SRA on both homologues. The mobility of SRA by genetic recombination readily explains the observed genetic variability of Tbr in East Africa. We conclude that new strains of the human pathogen Tbr are being generated continuously by recombination with the much larger pool of animal-infective trypanosomes. Such novel recombinants present a risk for future outbreaks of HAT.","[Gibson, Wendy; Peacock, Lori; Ferris, Vanessa; Fischer, Katrin; Livingstone, Jennifer; Thomas, James] Univ Bristol, Sch Biol Sci, Bristol, Avon, England; [Peacock, Lori; Ferris, Vanessa; Bailey, Mick] Univ Bristol, Dept Vet Clin Sci, Bristol, Avon, England","Gibson, W (reprint author), Univ Bristol, Sch Biol Sci, Bristol, Avon, England.",w.gibson@bris.ac.uk,"Gibson, Wendy/E-4182-2014",,"Wellcome Trust [079375, 088099]","This work was funded by The Wellcome Trust www.wellcome.ac.uk through project grants to WG and MB (079375, 088099).

The long-term impact of epilation (a common traditional practice of repeated plucking of lashes touching the eye) in preventing visual impairment and corneal opacity from TT is unknown. We conducted a randomized controlled trial of epilation versus surgery for the management of minor TT (fewer than six lashes touching the eye) in Ethiopia. Here we report the four-year outcome and the effect on vision and corneal opacity. Methodology/Principal Findings 1300 individuals with minor TT were recruited and randomly assigned to quality trichiasis surgery or repeated epilation using high quality epilation forceps by a trained person with good near vision. Participants were examined six-monthly for two-years, and then at four-years after randomisation. At two-years all epilation arm participants were offered free surgery. At four-years 1151 (88.5%) were re-examined: 572 (88%) and 579 (89%) from epilation and surgery arms, respectively. At that time, 21.1% of the surgery arm participants had recurrent TT; 189/572 (33%) of the epilation arm had received surgery, while 383 (67%) declined surgery and had continued epilating (""epilation-only""). Among the epilation-only group, 207 (54.1%) fully controlled their TT, 166 (43.3%) had minor TT and 10 (2.6%) had major TT (> 5 lashes). There were no differences between participants in the epilationonly, epilation-to-surgery and surgery arm participants in changes in visual acuity and corneal opacity between baseline and four-years. Conclusions/Significance Most minor TT participants randomised to the epilation arm continued epilating and controlled their TT. Change in vision and corneal opacity was comparable between surgery and epilation-only participants. This suggests that good quality epilation with regular follow-up is a reasonable second-line alternative to surgery for minor TT for individuals who either decline surgery or do not have immediate access to surgical treatment.","[Habtamu, Esmael; Rajak, Saul N.; Mabey, David C.

We trapped rodents and shrews around human habitations at two sites in Kenya (rural Asembo and urban Kibera) to determine the prevalence of Bartonella infection. Bartonella were detected by culture in five of seven host species. In Kibera, 60% of Rattus rattus were positive, as compared to 13% in Asembo. Bartonella were also detected in C. olivieri (7%), Lemniscomys striatus (50%), Mastomys natalensis (43%) and R. norvegicus (50%). Partial sequencing of the citrate synthase (gltA) gene of isolates showed that Kibera strains were similar to reference isolates from Rattus trapped in Asia, America, and Europe, but that most strains from Asembo were less similar. Host species and trapping location were associated with differences in infection status but there was no evidence of associations between host age or sex and infection status. Acute febrile illness occurs at high incidence in both Asembo and Kibera but the etiology of many of these illnesses is unknown. Bartonella similar to known human pathogens were detected in small mammals at both sites and investigation of the ecological determinants of host infection status and of the public health significance of Bartonella infections at these locations is warranted.","[Halliday, Jo E.

Methodology/Principal Findings In September-November 1998, in the hot-dry season in Zimbabwe's Zambezi Valley, we used artificial warthog burrows to capture adult females as they deposited larvae. Females were subjected to ovarian dissection and were defined as perinatal flies, assumed to have entered burrows to larviposit, if oocyte sizes indicated >95% pregnancy completion. Perinatal flies were defined as full-term pregnant if there was a late third instar larva in utero, or postpartum if the uterus was empty. All other females were defined as pre-full-term pregnant (pre-FT). Of 845 G. m. morsitans captured, 91% (765) were female and 295/724 (41%) of females dissected were perinatal flies. By contrast, of 2805 G. pallidipes captured only 71% (2003) were female and only 33% (596/1825) of females were perinatal. Among all perinatal females 67% (596/891) were G. pallidipes. Conversely, in burrows not fitted with traps such that flies were free to come and go - 1834 (59%) of pupae deposited were G. m. morsitans and only 1297 (41%) were G. pallidipes. Thus, while more full-term pregnant G. pallidipes enter burrows, greater proportions of G. m. morsitans larviposit in them, reflecting a greater discrimination among G. pallidipes in choosing larviposition sites. Catches of males and pre-FT females increased strongly with temperatures above 32 degrees C, indicating that these flies used burrows as refuges from high ambient temperatures. Conversely, catches of perinatal females changed little with maximum temperature but declined from late September through November: females may anticipate that burrows will be inundated during the forthcoming wet season. Ovarian age distributions of perinatal and pre-FT females were similar, consistent with all ages of females larvipositing in burrows with similar probability. Conclusions/Significance Artificial warthog burrows provide a novel method for collecting tsetse pupae, studying tsetse behaviour at larviposition, assessing the physiological status of female tsetse and their larvae, and of improving understanding of the physiological dynamics of terminal pregnancy, and population dynamics generally, with a view to improving methods of trypanosomiasis control.","[Hargrove, John W.] Univ Stellenbosch, Ctr Excellence Epidemiol Modelling & Anal SACEMA, ZA-7600 Stellenbosch, South Africa; [Muzari, M.

However, ""unprogrammed deworming"" (receipt of deworming drugs outside of nationally-run STH control programs) occurs frequently. Failure to account for these activities may compromise evaluations of MDA effectiveness. Methods We used a cross-sectional study design to evaluate STH infection and unprogrammed deworming among infants (aged 6-11 months), preschool-aged children (PSAC, aged 1-4 years), and school-aged children (SAC, aged 5-14 years) in Kibera, Kenya, an informal settlement not currently receiving nationally-run MDA for STH. STH infection was assessed by triplicate Kato-Katz. We asked heads of households with randomly-selected children about past-year receipt and source(s) of deworming drugs. Local non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and school staff participating in school-based deworming were interviewed to collect information on drug coverage. Results Of 679 children (18 infants, 184 PSAC, and 477 SAC) evaluated, 377 (55%) reported receiving at least one unprogrammed deworming treatment during the past year. PSAC primarily received treatments from chemists (48.3%) or healthcare centers (37.7%); SAC most commonly received treatments at school (55.0%). Four NGOs reported past-year deworming activities at 47 of >150 schools attended by children in our study area. Past-year deworming was negatively associated with any-STH infection (34.8% vs 45.4%, p = 0.005). SAC whose most recent deworming medication was sourced from a chemist were more often infected with Trichuris (38.0%) than those who received their most recent treatment from a health center (17.3%) or school (23.1%) (p = 0.05). Conclusion Unprogrammed deworming was received by more than half of children in our study area, from multiple sources. Both individual-level treatment and unprogrammed preventive chemotherapy may serve an important public health function, particularly in the absence of programmed deworming; however, they may also lead to an overestimation of programmed MDA effectiveness. A standardized, validated tool is needed to assess unprogrammed deworming.","[Harris, Julie R.; Worrell, Caitlin M.; Deming, Michael S.; Fox, LeAnne M.] Ctr Dis Control & Prevent, Parasit Dis Branch, Atlanta, GA 30333 USA; [Davis, Stephanie M.] Ctr Dis Control & Prevent, Div Global HIV AIDS, Atlanta, GA USA; [Odero, Kennedy; Mogeni, Ondari D.; Njenga, Sammy M.] Kenya Govt Med Res Ctr, Ctr Global Hlth Res, Nairobi, Kenya; [Mohammed, Aden] Sch Hlth Program, Dept Publ Hlth, Nairobi, Kenya; [Montgomery, Joel M.] Ctr Dis Control & Prevent, Div Global Hlth Protect, Nairobi, Kenya; [Njenga, Sammy M.] Kenya Govt Med Res Ctr, Eastern & Southern Africa Ctr Int Parasite Contro, Nairobi, Kenya; [Addiss, David G.] Task Force Global Hlth, Children Worms, Decatur, GA USA","Harris, JR (reprint author), Ctr Dis Control & Prevent, Parasit Dis Branch, Atlanta, GA 30333 USA.",ggt5@cdc.gov,,"Mogeni, Daniel/0000-0001-5133-3735; Njenga, Sammy/0000-0001-6309-476X",USAID [OG11-12021]; Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,"Funding for this study was obtained from USAID (No. OG11-12021) through an inter-agency agreement with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

One of the advantages of this method over the polymerase chain reaction is that DNA amplification occurs at a constant temperature, usually between 60-65 degrees C; therefore, expensive devices are unnecessary for this step. However, LAMP still requires complicated sample preparation steps and a well-equipped laboratory to produce reliable and reproducible results, which limits its use in resource-poor laboratories in most developing countries. In this study, we made several substantial modifications to the technique to carry out on-site diagnosis of Human African Trypanosomiasis (HAT) in remote areas using LAMP. The first essential improvement was that LAMP reagents were dried and stabilized in a single tube by incorporating trehalose as a cryoprotectant to prolong shelf life at ambient temperature. The second technical improvement was achieved by simplifying the sample preparation step so that DNA or RNA could be amplified directly from detergent-lysed blood samples. With these modifications, diagnosis of HAT in local clinics or villages in endemic areas becomes a reality, which could greatly impact on the application of diagnosis not only for HAT but also for other tropical diseases.","[Hayashida, Kyoko; Kajino, Kiichi; Sugimoto, Chihiro] Hokkaido Univ, Div Collaborat & Educ, Res Ctr Zoonosis Control, Sapporo, Hokkaido, Japan; [Hayashida, Kyoko] Obihiro Univ Agr & Vet Med, Natl Res Ctr Protozoan Dis, Obihiro, Hokkaido 080, Japan; [Hachaambwa, Lottie] Univ Teaching Hosp, Dept Internal Med, Lusaka, Zambia; [Namangala, Boniface] Univ Zambia, Dept Paraclin Studies, Sch Vet Med, Lusaka, Zambia","Hayashida, K (reprint author), Hokkaido Univ, Div Collaborat & Educ, Res Ctr Zoonosis Control, Sapporo, Hokkaido, Japan.",kiichi@czc.hokudai.ac.jp,"Sugimoto, Chihiro/F-6583-2012","Sugimoto, Chihiro/0000-0002-8708-0140","JST/JICA; SATREPS (Science and Technology Research Partnership for Sustainable Development) program, Japan; J-GRID (Japan Initiative for Global Research Network on Infectious Diseases), Japan","This research was financially supported by JST/JICA, SATREPS (Science and Technology Research Partnership for Sustainable Development) program, Japan, and also supported by J-GRID (Japan Initiative for Global Research Network on Infectious Diseases), Japan.

Although the country has performed exceptionally well in decreasing the mortality rate among children under five over the last few decades, mortality still remains relatively high. The main objective of this study is to identify the prevalence and determinants of the risk factors of child mortality in Bangladesh. Methods The data were based on a cross-sectional study collected from the Bangladesh Demographic and Health Survey (BDHS), 2011. The women participants numbered 16,025 from seven divisions of Bangladesh - Rajshahi, Dhaka, Chittagong, Barisal, Khulna, Rangpur and Sylhet. The chi(2) test and logistic regression model were applied to determine the prevalence and factors associated with child deaths in Bangladesh. Results In 2011, the prevalence of child deaths in Bangladesh for boys and girls was 13.0% and 11.6%, respectively. The results showed that birth interval and birth order were the most important factors associated with child death risks; mothers' education and socioeconomic status were also significant (males and females). The results also indicated that a higher birth order (7 & more) of child (OR=21.421 & 95% CI=16.879-27.186) with a short birth interval <= 2 years was more risky for child mortality, and lower birth order with longer birth interval >2 were significantly associated with child deaths. Other risk factors that affected child deaths in Bangladesh included young mothers of less than 25 years (mothers' median age (26-36 years): OR=0.670, 95% CI=0.551-0.815), women without education compared to those with secondary and higher education (OR =0.711 &.628, 95% CI=0.606-0.833 & 0.437-0.903), mothers who perceived their child body size to be larger than average and small size (OR=1.525 & 1.068, 95% CI=1.221-1.905 & 0.913-1.249), and mothers who delivered their child by non-caesarean (OR=1.687, 95% CI=1.253-2.272). Conclusion Community-based educational programs or awareness programs are required to reduce the child death in Bangladesh, especially for younger women should be increase the birth interval and decrease the birth order. The government should apply the strategies to enhance the socioeconomic conditions, especially in rural areas, increase the awareness program through media and expand schooling, particularly for girls.","[Hossain, Md.

Compliance to treatment is low and may contribute to increasing therapy failure. A 3 day regimen, including 2 injections of 7 mg/kg in 3 days may increase compliance. Methods In a randomized, single-blinded non-inferiority trial conducted in Suriname, 84 CL patients received the 7 day regimen and 79 CL patients received the 3 day regimen. Primary objective was the proportion of patients clinically cured at 6 weeks follow-up. Secondary objectives were clinical cure at 12 weeks follow-up; parasitological cure at 6 and 12 weeks; adverse and drug related toxicity events recorded one week after the end of treatment and health related quality of life. The non-inferiority margin was set at 15%, 1 sided test, alpha = 0.1. Results At 6 weeks follow-up 31 (39%) patients in the 3 day regimen and 41 (49%) patients in the 7 day regimen were clinically cured. Intention to treat (ITT) analyses showed that the difference in proportion clinically cured was -9.6% (90% Confidence Interval (CI): -22.3% to 3.2%). Per protocol (PP) analysis showed that the difference in proportion clinically cured was 0.2% (90% CI: -14.6% to 15.2%). ITT analysis showed that the difference in proportion parasitological cured at 6 weeks was -15.2% (90% CI:-28.0% to -2.5%). PP analyses showed similar results. Non-inferiority could not be concluded for all adverse and toxicological events. Conclusion We cannot conclude that the 3 day regimen is non-inferior to the 7 day regimen regarding proportion clinically and parasitological cured. Therefore there is no evidence to change the current standard practice of the 7 day regimen for the treatment of CL in Suriname.","[Hu, Ricardo V. P. F.; Sabajo, Leslie O.

A promising prophylactic approach has been immunotherapy with Toll-like receptor (TLR) agonists to enhance parasite-specific immune responses. We have previously reported that vaccination of C57BL/6 mice with live L. major plus the TLR9 agonist CpG DNA prevents lesion development and confers immunity to reinfection. Our current study aims to investigate whether other TLR agonists can be used in leishmanization without induction of lesion formation. We found that live L. major plus the TLR2 agonist Pam3CSK4 reduced the pathology in both genetically resistant (C57BL/6) and susceptible (BALB/c) mouse strains. The addition of Pam3CSK4 activated dermal dendritic cells and macrophages to produce greater amounts of proinflammatory cytokines in both mouse strains. Both Th1 and Th17 responses were enhanced by leishmanization with L. major plus Pam3CSK4 in C57BL/6 mice; however, Th17 cells were unchanged in BALB/c mice. The production of IL-17 from neutrophils was enhanced in both strains infected with L. major plus Pam3CSK4. However, the sustained influx of neutrophils in sites of infection was only observed in BALB/c mice. Our data demonstrate that the mechanism behind leishmanization with TLR agonists may be very different depending upon the immunological background of the host. This needs to be taken into account for the rational development of successful vaccines against the disease.","[Huang, Lu; Hinchman, Meleana; Mendez, Susana] Cornell Univ, Coll Vet Med, Baker Inst Anim Hlth, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA","Huang, L (reprint author), Cornell Univ, Coll Vet Med, Baker Inst Anim Hlth, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA.",lh346@cornell.edu,"Huang, Lu/G-3178-2011","Huang, Lu/0000-0002-7820-2177",NIH [R21-AI-61379]; Cornell Open-Access Publication Fund (COAP),"This work was financed by NIH R21-AI-61379 (to SM).

The clinical spectrum of post-CHIK (pCHIK) rheumatic disorders is wide. Evidence-based recommendations are needed to help physicians manage the treatment of afflicted patients. Patients and methods We conducted a 6-year case series retrospective study in Reunion Island of patients referred to a rheumatologist due to continuous rheumatic or musculoskeletal pains that persisted following CHIK infection. These various disorders were documented in terms of their clinical and therapeutic courses. Post-CHIK de novo chronic inflammatory rheumatisms (CIRs) were identified according to validated criteria. Results We reviewed 159 patient medical files. Ninety-four patients (59%) who were free of any articular disorder prior to CHIK met the CIR criteria: rheumatoid arthritis (n=40), spondyloarthritis (n=33), undifferentiated polyarthritis (n=21). Bone lesions detectable by radiography occurred in half of the patients (median time: 3.5 years pCHIK). A positive therapeutic response was achieved in 54 out of the 72 patients (75%) who were treated with methotrexate (MTX). Twelve out of the 92 patients (13%) received immunomodulatory biologic agents due to failure of contra-indication of MTX treatment. Other patients mainly presented with mechanical shoulder or knee disorders, bilateral distal polyarthralgia that was frequently associated with oedema at the extremities and tunnel syndromes. These pCHIK musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs) were managed with pain-killers, local and/or general anti-inflammatory drugs, and physiotherapy. Conclusion Rheumatologists in Reunion Island managed CHIK rheumatic disorders in a pragmatic manner following the outbreak in 2006. This retrospective study describes the common mechanical and inflammatory pCHIK disorders. We provide a diagnostic and therapeutic algorithm to help physicians deal with chronic patients, and to limit both functional and economic impacts. The therapeutic indication of MTX in pCHIK CIR could be approved in future efficacy trials.","[Javelle, Emilie; Simon, Fabrice] Laveran Mil Teaching Hosp, Dept Trop & Infect Dis, Marseille, France; [Ribera, Anne] Private Rheumatol Off, St Denis, Reunion, France; [Degasne, Isabelle] Hop Felix Guyon, Ctr Hosp Univ La Reunion, St Denis, Reunion, France; [Gauezere, Bernard-Alex] Hop Felix Guyon, Ctr Hosp Univ La Reunion, Intens Care Unit, St Denis, Reunion, France; [Marimoutou, Catherine] French Army Ctr Epidemiol & Publ Hlth IRBA, Marseille, France","Javelle, E (reprint author), Laveran Mil Teaching Hosp, Dept Trop & Infect Dis, Marseille, France.",emilie.javelle@gmail.com; simon-f@wanadoo.fr,,"GAUZERE, Bernard-Alex/0000-0001-5617-9634",,,,60,79,81,1,8,PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE,SAN FRANCISCO,"1160 BATTERY STREET, STE 100, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94111 USA",1935-2735,,,PLOS NEGLECT TROP D,Plos Neglect.

Annual mass drug administration (MDA) with azithromycin is a cornerstone of this strategy. If baseline prevalence of clinical signs of trachomatous inflammation - follicular among 1-9 year-olds (TF1-9) is >= 10% but <30%, the World Health Organization guidelines are for at least 3 annual MDAs; if >= 30%, 5. We assessed the likelihood of achieving the global elimination target of TF1-9 <5% at 3 and 5 year evaluations using program reports. Methodology/Principal Findings We used the International Trachoma Initiative's prevalence and treatment database. Of 283 cross-sectional survey pairs with baseline and follow-up data, MDA was conducted in 170 districts. Linear and logistic regression modeling was applied to these to investigate the effect of MDA on baseline prevalence. Reduction to <5% was less likely, though not impossible, at higher baseline TF1-9 prevalences. Increased number of annual MDAs, as well as no skipped MDAs, were significant predictors of reduced TF1-9 at follow-up. The probability of achieving the <5% target was <50% for areas with >= 30% TF1-9 prevalence at baseline, even with 7 or more continuous annual MDAs. Conclusions Number of annual MDAs alone appears insufficient to predict program progress; more information on the effects of baseline prevalence, coverage, and underlying environmental and hygienic conditions is needed. Programs should not skip MDAs, and at prevalences >30%, 7 or more annual MDAs may be required to achieve the target. There are five years left before the 2020 deadline to eliminate blinding trachoma. Low endemic settings are poised to succeed in their elimination goals. However, newly-identified high prevalence districts warrant immediate inclusion in the global program. Intensified application of the SAFE strategy is needed in order to guarantee blinding trachoma elimination by 2020.","[Jimenez, Violeta; Haddad, Danny] Emory Univ, Rollins Sch Publ Hlth, Hubert Dept Global Hlth, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA; [Jimenez, Violeta; Gelderblom, Huub C.; Flueckiger, Rebecca Mann; Emerson, Paul M.] Emory Univ, Task Force Global Hlth, Int Trachoma Initiat, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA; [Jimenez, Violeta; Haddad, Danny] Emory Univ, Global Ophthalmol Emory, Emory Eye Ctr, Sch Med, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA","Jimenez, V (reprint author), Emory Univ, Rollins Sch Publ Hlth, Hubert Dept Global Hlth, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA.",dhaddad@emory.edu,,"Emerson, Paul/0000-0002-6478-8816",Dean's Council of the Rollins School of Public Health; Research to Prevent Blindness (RPB); Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation,"VJ thanks the Dean's Council of the Rollins School of Public Health for supporting her work with a Robert W.

Domestic gardens are not only a common source of exposure to soil and thus to B. pseudomallei, but they also have been found to contain more B. pseudomallei than other environments. In this study we addressed whether anthropogenic manipulations common to gardens such as irrigation or fertilizers change the occurrence of B. pseudomallei. We conducted a soil microcosm experiment with a range of fertilizers and soil types as well as a longitudinal interventional study over three years on an experimental fertilized field site in an area naturally positive for B. pseudomallei. Irrigation was the only consistent treatment to increase B. pseudomallei occurrence over time. The effects of fertilizers upon these bacteria depended on soil texture, physicochemical soil properties and biotic factors. Nitrates and urea increased B. pseudomallei load in sand while phosphates had a positive effect in clay. The high buffering and cation exchange capacities of organic material found in a commercial potting mix led to a marked increase in soil salinity with no survival of B. pseudomallei after four weeks in the potting mix sampled. Imported grasses were also associated with B. pseudomallei occurrence in a multivariate model. With increasing population density in endemic areas these findings inform the identification of areas in the anthropogenic environment with increased risk of exposure to B. pseudomallei.","[Kaestli, Mirjam; Harrington, Glenda; Mayo, Mark; Chatfield, Mark D.; Harrington, Ian; Hill, Audrey; Currie, Bart J.] Menzies Sch Hlth Res, Global & Trop Hlth Div, Darwin, NT, Australia; [Munksgaard, Niels; Gibb, Karen] Charles Darwin Univ, Res Inst Environm & Livelihoods, Darwin, NT 0909, Australia","Kaestli, M (reprint author), Menzies Sch Hlth Res, Global & Trop Hlth Div, Darwin, NT, Australia.",mirjam.kaestli@menzies.edu.au,"Chatfield, Mark/N-2278-2013","Chatfield, Mark/0000-0002-0004-6274; , Mirjam/0000-0002-6053-5141",Australian Research Council [LP110100691]; Australian National Health and Medical Research Council [1046812],"This work was supported by grants from the Australian Research Council (www.arc.gov.au) (grant number LP110100691) and the Australian National Health and Medical Research Council (www.nhmrc.gov.au)(grant number 1046812).

A randomized controlled trial revealed that the immune response was not significantly increased following the second dose compared to that after the first dose. We aimed to evaluate the impact of an extended four week dosing schedule on vibriocidal response. Methodology/Principal Findings In this double blind randomized controlled non-inferiority trial, 356 Indian, non-pregnant residents aged 1 year or older were randomized to receive two doses of oral cholera vaccine at 14 and 28 day intervals. We compared vibriocidal immune responses between these schedules. Among adults, no significant differences were noted when comparing the rates of for V. cholerae O1 Inaba following two dose regimens administered at a 14 day interval (55%) vs the 28 day interval (58%). Similarly, no differences in seroconversion were demonstrated in children comparing the 14 (80%) and 28 day intervals (77%). Following 14 and 28 day dosing intervals, vibriocidal response rates against V. cholerae O1 Ogawa were 45% and 49% in adults and 73% and 72% in children respectively. Responses were lower for V. cholerae O139, but similar between dosing schedules for adults (20%, 20%) and children (28%, 20%). Conclusions/Significance Comparable immune responses and safety profiles between the two dosing schedules support the option for increased flexibility of current OCV dosing. Further operational research using a longer dosing regimen will provide answers to improve implementation and delivery of cholera vaccination in endemic and epidemic outbreak scenarios.","[Kanungo, Suman; Mahapatra, Tanmay; Sur, Dipika] Natl Inst Cholera & Enter Dis, Div Epidemiol, Kolkata, India; [Desai, Sachin N.; Kim, Deok Ryun; Ali, Mohammad; Wierzba, Thomas F.] Int Vaccine Inst, Dev & Delivery Unit, Seoul, South Korea; [Nandy, Ranjan Kumar; Sinha, Anuradha] Natl Inst Cholera & Enter Dis, Div Bacteriol, Kolkata, India; [Bhattacharya, Mihir Kumar] Natl Inst Cholera & Enter Dis, Div Clin Med, Kolkata, India; [Yang, Jae Seung] Int Vaccine Inst, Div Sci Lab, Seoul, South Korea; [Lopez, Anna Lena] Univ Philippines Manila, Natl Inst Hlth, Manila, Philippines; [Manna, Byomkesh; Bannerjee, Barnali] Natl Inst Cholera & Enter Dis, Div Data Management, Kolkata, India; [Ali, Mohammad] Johns Hopkins Bloomberg Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Int Hlth, Baltimore, MD USA; [Dhingra, Mandeep Singh] Shantha Biotech Private Ltd, Clin Res & Dev, Hyderabad, Andhra Pradesh, India; [Chandra, Ananga Mohan] Univ Calcutta, Dept Physiol, Kolkata, India; [Clemens, John D.] Int Ctr Diarrheal Dis Res, Off Execut Director, Dhaka, Bangladesh; [Clemens, John D.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Fielding Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Epidemiol, Los Angeles, CA USA; [Sur, Dipika] PATH India Off, Off Sci Director, New Delhi, India","Kanungo, S (reprint author), Natl Inst Cholera & Enter Dis, Div Epidemiol, Kolkata, India.",sdesai@ivi.int,"Bhutta, Zulfiqar/L-7822-2015; Ali, Mohammad/E-2365-2017","Bhutta, Zulfiqar/0000-0003-0637-599X; Ali, Mohammad/0000-0003-1410-388X",Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation [OPP52797],"This work was supported by grants from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation (OPP52797).

In the absence of alternative drugs, the use of higher or more frequent dosing with the existing drugs needs to be explored. We examined the effect of higher and/or more frequent dosing with albendazole with a fixed 300mg dose of diethylcarbamazine in a Wuchereria bancrofti endemic area in Odisha, India. Following screening, 104 consenting adults were randomly assigned to treatment with the standard regimen annually for 24 months (S1), or annually with increased dose (800mg albendazole)(H1) or with increased frequency (6 monthly) with either standard (S2) or increased (H2) dose. Pre-treatment microfilaria counts (GM) ranged from 348 to 459 mf/ml. Subjects were followed using microfilaria counts, OG4C3 antigen levels and ultrasound scanning for adult worm nests. Microfilarial counts tended to decrease more rapidly with higher or more frequent dosing at all time points. At 12 months, Mf clearance was marginally greater with the high dose regimens, while by 24 months, there was a trend to higher Mf clearance in the arm with increased frequency and 800mg of albendazole (76.9%) compared to other arms, (S1: 64%, S2: 69.2% & H1: 73.1%). Although higher and/or more frequent dosing showed a trend towards a greater decline in antigenemia and clearance of ""nests"", all regimens demonstrated the potential macrofilaricidal effect of the combination. The higher doses of albendazole did not result in a greater number or more severe side effects. The alternative regimens could be useful in the later stages of existing elimination programmes or achieving elimination more rapidly in areas where programmes have yet to start.","[Kar, Shantanu Kumar; Dwibedi, Bhagirathi; Kerketa, Anna Salomi; Maharana, Antaryami] Reg Med Res Ctr ICMR, Bhubaneswar, Odisha, India; [Panda, Sudanshu S.] Kalinga Inst Med Sci, Dept Med, Bhubaneswar, Odisha, India; [Mohanty, Prafulla Chandra] Ultrasound Clin, Bhubaneswar, Odisha, India; [Horton, John] Trop Projects, Hitchin, Herts, England; [Ramachandran, Cherubala P.] Univ Sains Malaysia, George Town, Malaysia","Kar, SK (reprint author), Reg Med Res Ctr ICMR, Bhubaneswar, Odisha, India.",hedgepigs@aol.com,,,"Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, Seattle, USA","Funding was provided by a grant from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, Seattle, USA.

Among T. pallidum adhesins, TP0136 is known to bind fibronectin (Fn), an important constituent of the host extracellular matrix. To deepen our understanding of the TP0136-Fn interaction dynamics, we used two naturally-occurring sequence variants of the TP0136 protein to investigate which region of the protein is responsible for Fn binding, and whether TP0136 would adhere to human cellular Fn in addition to plasma Fn and super Fn as previously reported. Fn binding assays were performed with recombinant proteins representing the two full-length TP0136 variants and their discrete regions. As a complementary approach, we tested inhibition of T. pallidum binding to Fn by recombinant full-length TP0136 proteins and fragments, as well as by anti-TP0136 immune sera. Our results show that TP0136 adheres more efficiently to cellular Fn than to plasma Fn, that the TP0136 NH2-terminal conserved region of the protein is primarily responsible for binding to plasma Fn but that binding sites for cellular Fn are also present in the protein's central and COOH-terminal regions. Additionally, message quantification studies show that tp0136 is highly transcribed during experimental infection, and that its message level increases in parallel to the host immune pressure on the pathogen, which suggests a possible role for this protein in T. pallidum persistence. In a time where syphilis incidence is high, our data will help in the quest to identify suitable targets for development of a much needed vaccine against this important disease.","[Ke, Wujian; Molini, Barbara J.; Lukehart, Sheila A.; Giacani, Lorenzo] Univ Washington, Harborview Med Ctr, Dept Med, Div Allergy & Infect Dis, Seattle, WA 98104 USA; [Ke, Wujian] Southern Med Univ, Grad Sch, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Ke, Wujian] Guangdong Prov Ctr STI & Skin Dis Control & Preve, Div STD, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Lukehart, Sheila A.; Giacani, Lorenzo] Univ Washington, Dept Global Hlth, Seattle, WA 98195 USA","Ke, W (reprint author), Univ Washington, Harborview Med Ctr, Dept Med, Div Allergy & Infect Dis, Seattle, WA 98104 USA.",giacal@u.washington.edu,,,National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases [R01 AI-42143]; American Sexually Transmitted Disease Association (ASTDA) Developmental Award [FA51342],"This work was funded by: National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases http://www.niaid.nih.gov/Pages/default.aspx R01 AI-42143 to SAL.

Especially in light of the fact that the World Health Organizaiton (WHO) recently launched its second yaws eradication campaign, there is a considerable need for reliable tools to identify treponemal infection in our closest relatives, African monkeys and great apes. It was hypothesized that commercially available serological tests detect simian anti-T. pallidum antibody in serum samples of baboons, with comparable sensitivity and specificity to their results on human sera. Test performances of five different treponemal tests (TTs) and two non-treponemal tests (NTTs) were evaluated using serum samples of 57 naturally T. pallidum-infected olive baboons (Papio anubis) from Lake Manyara National Park in Tanzania. The T. pallidum particle agglutination assay (TP-PA) was used as a gold standard for comparison. In addition, the overall infection status of the animals was used to further validate test performances. For most accurate results, only samples that originated from baboons of known infection status, as verified in a previous study by clinical inspection, PCR and immunohistochemistry, were included. All tests, TTs and NTTs, used in this study were able to reliably detect antibodies against T. pallidum in serum samples of infected baboons. The sensitivity of TTs ranged from 97.7-100%, while specificity was between 88.0-100.0%. The two NTTs detected anti-lipoidal antibodies in serum samples of infected baboons with a sensitivity of 83.3% whereas specificity was 100%. For screening purposes, the TT Espline TP provided the highest sensitivity and specificity and at the same time provided the most suitable format for use in the field. The enzyme immune assay Mastblot TP (IgG), however, could be considered as a confirmatory test.","[Knauf, Sascha; Dahlmann, Franziska] German Primate Ctr, Work Grp Neglected Trop Dis, Pathol Unit, Gottingen, Germany; [Batamuzi, Emmanuel K.] Sokoine Univ Agr, Dept Surg & Theriogenol, Fac Vet Med, Morogoro, Tanzania; [Frischmann, Sieghard] Mast Diagnost GmbH, Reinfeld, Germany; [Liu, Hsi] Ctr Dis Control & Prevent, Natl Ctr HIV AIDS Viral Hepatitis STD & TB Preven, Atlanta, GA USA","Knauf, S (reprint author), German Primate Ctr, Work Grp Neglected Trop Dis, Pathol Unit, Gottingen, Germany.",sknauf@dpz.eu,"Knauf, Sascha/F-1661-2017; Knauf, Sascha/J-1726-2019","Knauf, Sascha/0000-0001-5744-4946; Knauf, Sascha/0000-0001-5744-4946",German Academic Exchange Program [D/06/43974]; Christian Vogel Fond; World Association Zoos and Aquariums [07002]; University of Leipzig; Justus Liebig University of Giessen; Scil animal care company; Telinject; Translogistic; Wuppertal Zoo,"SK received funding and support for the field work at Lake Manyara National Park from German Academic Exchange Program (D/06/43974, https://www.daad.de/de/), Christian Vogel Fond (2006, http://www.gf-primatologie.de/), World Association Zoos and Aquariums (07002, http://www.waza.org/en/site/home), University of Leipzig, Justus Liebig University of Giessen, Scil animal care company, Telinject, Translogistic, and Wuppertal Zoo.

This case-control study assessed the associations between gastrointestinal infections and diarrhea in children from rural Ghana. Methods Stool samples were collected from 548 children with diarrhea and from 686 without gastrointestinal symptoms visiting a hospital from 2007-2008. Samples were analyzed by microscopy and molecular methods. Results The organisms most frequently detected in symptomatic cases were Giardia lamblia, Shigella spp./enteroinvasive Escherichia coli (EIEC), and Campylobacter jejuni. Infections with rotavirus (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 8.4; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 4.3-16.6), C. parvum/ hominis (aOR = 2.7; 95% CI: 1.4-5.2) and norovirus (aOR = 2.0; 95% CI: 1.3-3.0) showed the strongest association with diarrhea. The highest attributable fractions (AF) for diarrhea were estimated for rotavirus (AF = 14.3%; 95% CI: 10.9-17.5%), Shigella spp./ EIEC (AF = 10.5%; 95% CI: 3.5-17.1%), and norovirus (AF = 8.2%; 95% CI 3.2-12.9%). Co-infections occurred frequently and most infections presented themselves independently of other infections. However, infections with E. dispar, C. jejuni, and norovirus were observed more often in the presence of G. lamblia. Conclusions Diarrheal diseases in children from a rural area in sub-Saharan Africa are mainly due to infections with rotavirus, Shigella spp./EIEC, and norovirus. These associations are strongly age-dependent, which should be considered when diagnosing causes of diarrhea. The presented results are informative for both clinicians treating gastrointestinal infections as well as public health experts designing control programs against diarrheal diseases.","[Krumkamp, Ralf; Schwarz, Norbert Georg; Adelkofer, Julia; Loag, Wibke; Eibach, Daniel; Tannich, Egbert; May, Juergen] Bernhard Nocht Inst Trop Med, D-20359 Hamburg, Germany; [Krumkamp, Ralf; Tannich, Egbert; May, Juergen] German Ctr Infect Res DZIF, Partner Site Hamburg Borstel Lubeck, Lubeck, Germany; [Sarpong, Nimako] Kumasi Ctr Collaborat Res Trop Med KCCR, Kumasi, Ghana; [Hagen, Ralf Matthias] German Armed Forces Hosp Hamburg, BNITM, Dept Trop Med, Hamburg, Germany; [Adu-Sarkodie, Yaw] KNUST, Kumasi, Ghana","Krumkamp, R (reprint author), Bernhard Nocht Inst Trop Med, Bernhard Nocht Str 74, D-20359 Hamburg, Germany.",krumkamp@bnitm.de,,,"UBS Optimus Foundation; German Center for Infection Research (Deutsches Zentrum fur Infektionsforschung, DZIF) [8000 201-3 (TTU 03.704)]","This work was supported by UBS Optimus Foundation and by the German Center for Infection Research (Deutsches Zentrum fur Infektionsforschung, DZIF), funding reference number: 8000 201-3 (TTU 03.704).

CHIKV transmission can be mediated via the Aedes albopictus mosquito; however, very little is currently known about the involvement of mosquito cellular factors during CHIKV-infection within the mosquito cells. Unravelling the neglected aspects of mosquito proteome changes in CHIKV=infected mosquito cells may increase our understanding on the differences in the host factors between arthropod and mammalian cells for successful replication of CHIKV. In this study, the CHIKV-infected C6/36 cells with differential cellular proteins expression were profiled using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2DE) coupled with the use of matrixassisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS). 2DE analysis on CHIKV-infected C6/36 cells has shown 23 mosquito cellular proteins that are differentially regulated, and which are involved diverse biological pathways, such as protein folding and metabolic processes. Among those identified mosquito proteins, spermatogenesis-associated factor, enolase phosphatase e-1 and chaperonin-60kD have been found to regulate CHIKV infection. Furthermore, siRNA-mediated gene knockdown of these proteins has demonstrated the biological importance of these host proteins that mediate CHIKV infection. These findings have provided an insight to the importance of mosquito host factors in the replication of CHIKV, thus providing a potential channel for developing novel antiviral strategies against CHIKV transmission.","[Lee, Regina Ching Hua; Chu, Justin Jang Hann] Natl Univ Singapore, Yong Loo Lin Sch Med, Natl Univ Hlth Syst, Lab Mol RNA Virol & Antiviral Strateg,Dept Microb, Singapore 117595, Singapore","Lee, RCH (reprint author), Natl Univ Singapore, Yong Loo Lin Sch Med, Natl Univ Hlth Syst, Lab Mol RNA Virol & Antiviral Strateg,Dept Microb, Singapore 117595, Singapore.",miccjh@nus.edu.sg,,,Biomedical Research Council; A*Star [09/1/12/19/596 (R182-000-188-305)]; MINDEF DIRP [R182-000-210-232],"This work is supported by a grant from Biomedical Research Council, A*Star, Grant No: 09/1/12/19/596 (R182-000-188-305) and MINDEF DIRP (R182-000-210-232).

The epidemiology of JE in the Philippines is not well defined. To support consideration of JE vaccine for introduction into the national schedule in the Philippines, we conducted a systematic literature review and summarized JE surveillance data from 2011 to 2014. Methods We conducted searches on Japanese encephalitis and the Philippines in four databases and one library. Data from acute encephalitis syndrome (AES) and JE surveillance and from the national reference laboratory from January 2011 to March 2014 were tabulated and mapped. Results We identified 29 published reports and presentations on JE in the Philippines, including 5 serologic surveys, 18 reports of clinical cases, and 8 animal studies (including two with both clinical cases and animal data). The 18 clinical studies reported 257 cases of laboratory-confirmed JE from 1972 to 2013. JE virus (JEV) was the causative agent in 7% to 18% of cases of clinical meningitis and encephalitis combined, and 16% to 40% of clinical encephalitis cases. JE predominantly affected children under 15 years of age and 6% to 7% of cases resulted in death. Surveillance data from January 2011 to March 2014 identified 73 (15%) laboratory-confirmed JE cases out of 497 cases tested. Summary This comprehensive review demonstrates the endemicity and extensive geographic range of JE in the Philippines, and supports the use of JE vaccine in the country. Continued and improved surveillance with laboratory confirmation is needed to systematically quantify the burden of JE, to provide information that can guide prioritization of high risk areas in the country and determination of appropriate age and schedule of vaccine introduction, and to measure the impact of preventive measures including immunization against this important public health threat.","[Lena Lopez, Anna; Aldaba, Josephine G.] Univ Philippines, Natl Inst Hlth, Inst Child Hlth & Human Dev, Manila, Philippines; [Roque, Vito G., Jr.] Epidemiol Bur, Dept Hlth, Manila, Philippines; [Tandoc, Amado O., III; Sy, Ava Kristy] Res Inst Trop Med, Dept Virol, Manila, Philippines; [Esperanza Espino, Fe] Res Inst Trop Med, Dept Parasitol, Manila, Philippines; [DeQuiroz-Castro, Maricel] Off World Hlth Org Representat Philippines, Manila, Philippines; [Jee, Youngmee; Fox, Kimberley K.] WHO, Reg Off Western Pacific, Div Communicable Dis, Manila, Philippines; [Ducusin, Maria Joyce] Dis Prevent & Control Bur, Dept Hlth, Manila, Philippines","Lopez, AL (reprint author), Univ Philippines, Natl Inst Hlth, Inst Child Hlth & Human Dev, Manila, Philippines.",annalenalopez@gmail.com,,"Tandoc, Amado III/0000-0002-2186-4989",Government of the Philippines; World Health Organization; Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; PATH [GAT.1724-02226-SUB],"Surveillance for Japanese encephalitis is a program of the Philippines' Department of Health and funded by the Government of the Philippines.

Understanding of local knowledge, attitudes, and practices regarding STH infection in rural China has until now, been sparse, although such information is critical for prevention and control initiatives. Methodology/Principal Findings This study aims to elucidate the structural and sociocultural factors that underlie high STH infection rates as well as explain why deworming treatment is rarely sought for children. In-depth, qualitative interviews were conducted in six rural villages in Guizhou Province; participants included schoolchildren, children's parents and grandparents, and village doctors. Data analysis exposed three predominant reasons for high STH prevalence: (1) lack of awareness and skepticism about the high prevalence of STH infection, (2) local myths about STH infection and deworming treatment, and (3) poor quality of village health care. Conclusions/Significance The findings from this study reveal reasons for why deworming treatment is not sought, and inform specific recommendations for a deworming intervention that can more effectively address underlying barriers to deworming in areas of persistently high STH infection rates. The main barrier to seeking STH treatment is not availability or cost of the drugs, but rather the lack of impetus to seek the drugs. A comprehensive nationwide deworming program in China should involve annual provision of free deworming treatment in village clinics or schools, distribution of culturally appropriate educational materials to inform children and families about STH infection, and improvement of the quality of health care delivered by village clinicians.","[Lu, Louise; Medina, Alexis; Smith, Scott; Rozelle, Scott] Stanford Univ, Freeman Spogli Inst Int Studies, Rural Educ Act Program, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Liu, Chengfang; Zhang, Linxiu] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Ctr Chinese Agr Policy, Beijing, Peoples R China","Lu, L (reprint author), Stanford Univ, Freeman Spogli Inst Int Studies, Rural Educ Act Program, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",cfliu.ccap@igsnrr.ac.cn,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China [71473240, 71333012]; International Initiative for Impact Evaluation [PW2.04.02.02]","CL and LZ acknowledge financial support from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (grant numbers 71473240, 71333012), website http://www.nsfc.gov.cn/.

Treatment-induced pericystic inflammation and its association with blood brain barrier (BBB) dysfunction, as determined by Evans blue (EB) extravasation, was studied in infected untreated and anthelmintic-treated pigs. We compared the magnitude and extent of the pericystic inflammation, presence of EB-stained capsules, the level of damage to the parasite, expression of genes for proinflammatory and regulatory cytokines, chemokines, and tissue remodeling by quantitative PCR assays between treated and untreated infected pigs and between EB-stained (blue) and non stained (clear) cysts. Inflammatory scores were higher in pericystic tissues from EB-stained cysts compared to clear cysts from untreated pigs and also from anthelmintic-treated pigs 48 hr and 120 hr after treatment. The degree of inflammation correlated with the severity of cyst wall damage and both increased significantly at 120 hours. Expression levels of the proinflammatory genes for IL-6, IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha were higher in EB-stained cysts compared to clear cysts and unaffected brain tissues, and were generally highest at 120 hr. Additionally, expression of some markers of immunoregulatory activity (IL-10, IL-2R alpha) were decreased in EB-stained capsules. An increase in other markers for regulatory T cells (CTLA4, FoxP3) was found, as well as significant increases in expression of two metalloproteases, MMP1 and MMP2 at 48 hr and 120 hr post-treatment. We conclude that the increase in severity of the inflammation caused by treatment is accompanied by both a proinflammatory and a complex regulatory response, largely limited to pericystic tissues with compromised vascular integrity. Because treatment induced inflammation occurs in porcine NCC similar to that in human cases, this model can be used to investigate mechanisms involved in host damaging inflammatory responses and agents or modalities that may control damaging post treatment inflammation.","[Mahanty, Siddhartha; Nash, Theodore E.] NIAID, Parasit Dis Lab, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; [Mahanty, Siddhartha; Angel Orrego, Miguel; Marzal, Miguel; Cangalaya, Carla; Paredes, Adriana; Guerra-Giraldez, Cristina; Garcia, Hector H.; Nash, Theodore E.] Univ Peruana Cayetano Heredia, Immunopathol Lab, Lima, Peru; [Mayta, Holger; Guerra-Giraldez, Cristina; Garcia, Hector H.] Univ Peruana Cayetano Heredia, Fac Ciencias & Filosofia, Lima, Peru; [Gonzales-Gustavson, Eloy; Arroyo, Gianfranco; Gonzalez, Armando E.] Univ Nacl Mayor San Marcos, Fac Vet Sci, Lima, Peru; [Garcia, Hector H.] Inst Nacl Ciencias Neurol, Cysticercosis Unit, Lima, Peru","Mahanty, S (reprint author), NIAID, Parasit Dis Lab, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA.",smahanty@niaid.nih.gov,,"Mahanty, Siddhartha/0000-0003-1068-0524; Mayta, Holger/0000-0001-5306-628X; Cangalaya, Carla/0000-0002-3525-8445; Orrego Solano, Miguel Angel/0000-0003-0036-427X; Guerra-Giraldez, Cristina/0000-0002-9287-9838; Gonzalez, Armando/0000-0003-1909-1873; Gonzales-Gustavson, Eloy/0000-0001-7328-2983","Intramural Research Program of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, NIH; Fogarty International Center-NIH Training grant [D43 TW001140]; Wellcome Trust Senior International Research Fellowship in Public Health and Tropical Medicine","This research was supported in part by the Intramural Research Program of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, NIH.

While these diseases are associated with significant morbidity and mortality, there are few adequate treatments available. Sterol 14alpha-demethylase (CYP51) in the parasite sterol biosynthesis pathway has been the focus of considerable interest as a novel drug target in Leishmania. However, its essentiality in Leishmania donovani has yet to be determined. Here, we use a dual biological and pharmacological approach to demonstrate that CYP51 is indispensable in L. donovani. We show via a facilitated knockout approach that chromosomal CYP51 genes can only be knocked out in the presence of episomal complementation and that this episome cannot be lost from the parasite even under negative selection. In addition, we treated wildtype L. donovani and CYP51-deficient strains with 4-aminopyridyl-based inhibitors designed specifically for Trypanosoma cruzi CYP51. While potency was lower than in T. cruzi, these inhibitors had increased efficacy in parasites lacking a CYP51 allele compared to complemented parasites, indicating inhibition of parasite growth via a CYP51-specific mechanism and confirming essentiality of CYP51 in L. donovani. Overall, these results provide support for further development of CYP51 inhibitors for the treatment of visceral leishmaniasis.","[McCall, Laura-Isobel; Siqueira-Neto, Jair L.; Podust, Larissa M.; McKerrow, James H.] Univ Calif San Diego, Skaggs Sch Pharm & Pharmaceut Sci, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [El Aroussi, Amale; Vieira, Debora F.; De Muylder, Geraldine; Kellar, Danielle] Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Pathol, San Francisco, CA 94140 USA; [Choi, Jun Yong; Roush, William R.] Scripps Florida, Dept Chem, Jupiter, FL USA; [Johnston, Jonathan B.] Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Pharmaceut Chem, San Francisco, CA USA; [Chen, Steven] Univ Calif San Francisco, Small Mol Discovery Ctr, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA","McCall, LI (reprint author), Univ Calif San Diego, Skaggs Sch Pharm & Pharmaceut Sci, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA.",jmckerrow@ucsd.edu,"Siqueira-Neto, Jair/D-6040-2012","Siqueira-Neto, Jair/0000-0001-9574-8174",Fonds de Recherche Sante-Quebec [29361]; NIH RO1 grant [AI095437]; European Union Seventh Framework Programme [602773-KINDRED],"LIM acknowledges receiving a postdoctoral fellowship from the Fonds de Recherche Sante-Quebec (29361, http://www.frqs.gouv.qc.ca/en/index.shtml).

Clinical studies looking at gene expression in patients with severe dengue show a reduced expression of interferon stimulated genes compared to patients with dengue fever. Interestingly, there are conflicting reports as to the ability of DENV or other flaviviruses to inhibit IFN-alpha/beta signaling. Methodology/Principal Findings In order to determine the relative inhibition of IFN-alpha/beta signaling by DENVs, a method combining flow cytometry and a four-parameter logistic regression model was established. A representative isolate from DENV-1, -3 and -4 and seventeen representative isolates encompassing all DENV-2 genotypes were evaluated. All of the DENVs evaluated in this study were capable of inhibiting IFN-alpha/beta signaling. Most of the strains were able to inhibit IFN-alpha/beta to a degree similar to DENV strain 16681; however, DENV-2 sylvatic strains demonstrated an increased inhibition of phosphorylated signal transducer and activator of transcription (pSTAT1). Surprisingly, we were unable to observe inhibition of pSTAT1 by DENV-2 sylvatic strains or the Asian strain 16681 in non-human primate (NHP) cell lines. Analysis in primary Rhesus macaque dendritic cells suggests that DENVs are capable of inhibiting IFN signaling in these cells. However, contrary to human dendritic cells, production of IFN-a was detected in the supernatant of DENV-infected Rhesus macaque dendritic cells. Conclusions The ability of DENVs to inhibit IFN-alpha/beta signaling is conserved. Although some variation in the inhibition was observed, the moderate differences may be difficult to correlate with clinical outcomes. DENVs were unable to inhibit pSTAT1 in NHP cell lines, but their ability to inhibit pSTAT1 in primary Rhesus macaque dendritic cells suggests that this may be a cell specific phenomena or due to the transformed nature of the cell lines.","[Medina, Freddy A.; Santiago, Gilberto A.; Medina, Juan F.; Santiago, Luis M.; Munoz-Jordan, Jorge L.] Centers Dis Control & Prevent, Div Vector Borne Dis, Dengue Branch, San Juan, PR 00920 USA; [Torres-Malave, Giselle] Univ Puerto Rico, Dept Microbiol & Med Zool, San Juan, PR 00936 USA; [Chase, Amanda J.] Mercer Univ, Sch Med, Div Basic Med Sci, Macon, GA 31207 USA","Medina, FA (reprint author), Centers Dis Control & Prevent, Div Vector Borne Dis, Dengue Branch, San Juan, PR 00920 USA.",ckq2@cdc.gov,,,Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,"This work was funded by the Intramural Research Program of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

This is unfortunate since CCHFV antibodies in animals can be used as indicator for virus circulation in a geographic area and therewith potential risk of human exposure. This paper therefore reports on a novel ELISA for the detection of CCHFV-specific antibodies in cattle and on its application for testing ruminant sera from the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. Principal Findings A highly sensitive and specific ELISA was developed to detect CCHFV-specific IgG antibodies in cattle. The assay was validated by using 503 negative serum samples from a country where CCHFV has never been detected until now, and by using 54 positive serum samples. The positive sera were verified by using two commercially available assays (for testing human serum) which we have adapted for use in animals. The sensitivity of the novel ELISA was 98% and its specificity 99%. The presence of Hyalomma ticks was demonstrated in the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and depending on the region antibody prevalence rates up to 80% were detected in the cattle population. Conclusion This article describes a fully validated, highly sensitive and specific ELISA for the detection of CCHFV-specific IgG antibodies in cattle. Using this assay, CCHFV-specific antibodies were detected for the first time in cattle in the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, giving evidence for an active circulation of this virus in the country. Supporting this conclusion, the occurrence of the main vector of CCHFV was demonstrated in the present work for the first time in Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.","[Mertens, Marc; Schuster, Isolde; Balkema-Buschmann, Anne; Groschup, Martin H.] Fed Res Inst Anim Hlth, Friedrich Loeffler Inst, Inst Novel & Emerging Infect Dis, Greifswald, Germany; [Vatansever, Zati] Kafkas Univ, Fac Vet Med, Dept Parasitol, Kars, Turkey; [Mrenoshki, Slavcho; Krstevski, Kiril; Stefanovska, Jovana; Djadjovski, Igor; Cvetkovikj, Iskra; Mitrov, Dine] St Cyril & Methodius Univ, Fac Vet Med, Skopje, Macedonia; [Farkas, Robert] Szent Istvan Univ, Fac Vet Sci, Budapest, Hungary; [Donnet, Fabien; Comtet, Loic] IDVet, Grabels, France; [Tordo, Noel; Ben Mechlia, Mohamed] Inst Pasteur, Unit Antiviral Strategies, Paris, France","Mertens, M (reprint author), Fed Res Inst Anim Hlth, Friedrich Loeffler Inst, Inst Novel & Emerging Infect Dis, Greifswald, Germany.",martin.groschup@fli.bund.de,"vatansever, zati/A-2344-2016; Mrenoshki, Slavcho/M-2219-2016","vatansever, zati/0000-0003-3460-3849; Mrenoshki, Slavcho/0000-0002-0923-7229",EU [FP7-261504],"This study was funded by EU grant FP7-261504 EDENext and is catalogued by the EDENext Steering Committee as EDENext300 (http://www.edenext.eu).

Methods Six hundred and thirty five singletons born to pregnant women enrolled before 29 weeks of gestation in a trial comparing two intermittent preventive treatments for malaria were assessed for cognitive andmotor functions using the Mullen Scales of Early Learning, in the TOVI study, at twelve months of age in the district of Allada in Benin. Stool samples of pregnant women were collected at recruitment, second antenatal care (ANC) visit (at least one month after recruitment) and just before delivery, and were tested for helminths using the Kato-Katz technique. All pregnant women were administered a total of 600 mg ofmebendazole (100 mg two times daily for 3 days) to be taken after the first ANC visit. The intake was not directly observed. Results Prevalence of helminth infection was 11.5%, 7.5% and 3.0% at first ANC visit, second ANC visit and at delivery, respectively. Children of mothers who were infected with hookworms at the first ANC visit had 4.9 (95% CI: 1.3-8.6) lower mean gross motor scores compared to those whose mothers were not infected with hookworms at the first ANC visit, in the adjusted model. Helminth infection at least once during pregnancy was associated with infant cognitive and gross motor functions after adjusting for maternal education, gravidity, child sex, family possessions, and quality of the home stimulation. Conclusion Helminth infection during pregnancy is associated with poor cognitive and gross motor outcomes in infants. Measures to prevent helminth infection during pregnancy should be reinforced.","[Mireku, Michael O.] Univ Paris 06, Paris, France; [Mireku, Michael O.; Bodeau-Livinec, Florence] Ecole Hautes Etud St Publ, Dept Epidemiol & Biostat, Rennes, France; [Mireku, Michael O.; Ouedraogo, Smaila] Mere & Enfant Face Aux Infect Trop, IRD, Paris, France; [Boivin, Michael J.] Michigan State Univ, Dept Psychiat, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Boivin, Michael J.] Michigan State Univ, Dept Nephrol, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Boivin, Michael J.] Michigan State Univ, Dept Ophthalmol, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Davidson, Leslie L.] Columbia Univ, Mailman Sch Publ Hlth, New York, NY USA; [Davidson, Leslie L.] Columbia Univ, Coll Phys & Surg, New York, NY USA; [Ouedraogo, Smaila] Ctr Hosp Univ Yalgado Ouedraogo, Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso; [Koura, Ghislain K.] Union Int TB & Malad Resp, Dept TB & VIH, Paris, France; [Alao, Maroufou J.] Hop Mere & Enfant Lagune Cotonou, Serv Pediat, Cotonou, Benin; [Massougbodji, Achille] Univ Abomey Calavi, Fac Sci Sante, Cotonou, Benin; [Cot, Michel] Univ Paris 05, Fac Sci Pharmaceut & Biol, PRES Sorbonne Paris Cite, Paris, France; [Bodeau-Livinec, Florence] Paris Descartes Univ, INSERM, Ctr Epidemiol & Stat Sorbonne Paris Cite,DHU Risk, Perinatal & Pediat Epidemiol Res Team Epope,UMR 1, Paris, France; [Bodeau-Livinec, Florence] NYU, Med Ctr, Dept Microbiol, Div Parasitol, New York, NY 10016 USA","Mireku, MO (reprint author), Univ Paris 06, Paris, France.",michael.osei.mireku@gmail.com,"Bodeau-Livinec, Florence/U-9053-2017; Cot, Michel/E-7633-2011; Mireku, Michael/D-5262-2016; Mireku, Michael/O-1714-2018","Bodeau-Livinec, Florence/0000-0002-4266-6287; Cot, Michel/0000-0003-3014-4294; Mireku, Michael/0000-0002-2157-8456; Koura, Kobto G./0000-0002-8928-6732",Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health & Human Development (NIH/NICHD) [R21-HD060524]; European and Developing Countries Clinical Trials Partnership [EDCTP-IP.07.31080.002],"The Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health & Human Development (NIH/NICHD) funded The TOVI study, grant R21-HD060524.

Pigs are a useful animal model for scabies, and show clinical and immunologic changes similar to those in humans. Crusted scabies can be readily established in pigs by treatment with the glucocorticoid dexamethasone (Dex). Methodology/Principal Findings Prospective study of 24 pigs in four groups: a) Scabies+/Dex+,b) Scabies+/Dex-,c) Scabies-/Dex+ and d) Scabies-/Dex-. Clinical symptoms were monitored. Histological profiling and transcriptional analysis of skin biopsies was undertaken to compare changes in cell infiltrates and representative cytokines. A range of clinical responses to Sarcoptes scabiei were observed in Dex treated and non-immunosuppressed pigs. An association was confirmed between disease severity and transcription of the Th2 cytokines IL-4 and IL-13, and up-regulation of the Th17 cytokines IL-17 and IL-23 in pigs with crusted scabies. Immunohistochemistry revealed marked infiltration of lymphocytes and mast cells, and strong staining for IL-17. Conclusions/Significance While an allergic Th2 type response to scabies has been previously described, these results suggest that IL-17 related pathways may also contribute to immunopathology of crusted scabies. This may lead to new strategies to protect vulnerable subjects from contracting recurrent crusted scabies.","[Mounsey, Kate E.; Walton, Shelley F.] Univ Sunshine Coast, Sch Hlth & Sport Sci, Inflammat & Healing Res Cluster, Maroochydore, Qld, Australia; [Mounsey, Kate E.; Murray, Hugh C.; Pasay, Cielo; McCarthy, James S.] QIMR Berghofer Med Res Inst, Div Infect Dis, Herston, Qld, Australia; [Bielefeldt-Ohmann, Helle] Univ Queensland, Sch Vet Sci, Gatton, Qld, Australia; [Holt, Deborah C.; Currie, Bart J.] Charles Darwin Univ, Menzies Sch Hlth Res, Global & Trop Hlth Div, Darwin, NT 0909, Australia; [McCarthy, James S.] Univ Queensland, Sch Med, Herston, Qld, Australia","Mounsey, KE (reprint author), Univ Sunshine Coast, Sch Hlth & Sport Sci, Inflammat & Healing Res Cluster, Maroochydore, Qld, Australia.",kmounsey@usc.edu.au,"McCarthy, James/C-1681-2009; Walton, Shelley/A-9767-2012","Walton, Shelley/0000-0002-5857-6913; Holt, Deborah/0000-0003-4951-1891; McCarthy, James/0000-0001-6596-9718","Australian National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) [496635, 1027434]; Australian Research Council DECRA Fellowship [DE120101701]; NHMRC [1041802]","This work was supported by Australian National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC, www.nhmrc.gov.au) Project Grants (496635, 1027434 to KEM, JSM, SFW, DCH, BJC, CP); an Australian Research Council (www.arc.gov.au) DECRA Fellowship (DE120101701 to KEM); and an NHMRC Practitioner Fellowship (1041802 to JSM).

Further analysis of jigger antigens against pooled human sera from infested victims in Western blot revealed three immunodominant antigens. Using simple regression analysis molecular weights of the three immunodominant antigens were estimated as 51.795, 23.395 and 15.38 kDa respectively. These results are important since they would help understand immunological behavior of the parasites.

This pathogen does not derive ATP from its host but has its own mechanism for the generation of ATP. Interestingly, this molecule as well as several antigenic proteins act as bio-markers for the detection of leprosy. One such bio-marker is the 18 kDa antigen. This 18 kDa antigen is a small heat shock protein (HSP18) whose molecular chaperone function is believed to help in the growth and survival of the pathogen. But, no evidences of interaction of ATP with HSP18 and its effect on the structure and chaperone function of HSP18 are available in the literature. Here, we report for the first time evidences of ""HSP18-ATP"" interaction and its consequences on the structure and chaperone function of HSP18. TNP-ATP binding experiment and surface plasmon resonance measurement showed that HSP18 interacts with ATP with a sub-micromolar binding affinity. Comparative sequence alignment between M. leprae HSP18 and alpha B-crystallin identified the sequence 49KADSLDIDIE58 of HSP18 as the Walker-B ATP binding motif. Molecular docking studies revealed that beta 4-beta 8 groove/strands as an ATP interactive region in M. leprae HSP18. ATP perturbs the tertiary structure of HSP18 mildly and makes it less susceptible towards tryptic cleavage. ATP triggers exposure of additional hydrophobic patches at the surface of HSP18 and induces more stability against chemical and thermal denaturation. In vitro aggregation and thermal inactivation assays clearly revealed that ATP enhances the chaperone function of HSP18. Our studies also revealed that the alteration in the chaperone function of HSP18 is reversible and is independent of ATP hydrolysis. As the availability and binding of ATP to HSP18 regulates its chaperone function, this functional inflection may play an important role in the survival of M. leprae in hosts.","[Nandi, Sandip Kumar; Chakraborty, Ayon; Panda, Alok Kumar; Biswas, Ashis] Indian Inst Technol, Sch Basic Sci, Bhubaneswar, Orissa, India; [Ray, Sougata Sinha] Wipro GE Healthcare, Kolkata, India; [Kar, Rajiv Kumar; Bhunia, Anirban] Bose Inst, Dept Biophys, Kolkata, India","Nandi, SK (reprint author), Indian Inst Technol, Sch Basic Sci, Bhubaneswar, Orissa, India.",abiswas@iitbbs.ac.in,"PANDA, ALOK/G-6818-2015","PANDA, ALOK/0000-0002-4452-993X; NANDI, SANDIP/0000-0003-0304-4255","Council of Scientific and Industrial Research, India [37(1535)/12/EMR-II(ABi)]; Indian Institute of Technology Bhubaneswar; ICMR, India [45/25/2012-Bio/BMS]","This work was supported from the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research, India grant 37 (1535)/12/EMR-II (ABi).

Current behaviour-change models and theories present two main approaches for (healthier) decision-making: one analytical/logical, and one experiential/emotional/ intuitive. Therefore, to achieve an integral and dynamic understanding of the public perceptions both approaches should be considered: community surveys should measure cognitive understanding of health-risk contexts, and also explore how past experiences affect this understanding. In 2011, community perceptions regarding domestic source reduction were assessed in Madeira Island. After Madeira's first dengue outbreak (2012) a unique opportunity to compare perceptions before and after the outbreak-experience occurred. This was the aim of this study, which constituted the first report on the effect of an outbreak experience on community perceptions regarding a specific vector-borne disease. A cross-sectional survey was performed within female residents at the most aegypti-infested areas. Perceptions regarding domestic source reduction were assessed according to the Essential Perception (EP)-analysis tool. A matching process paired individuals from studies performed before and after the outbreak, ensuring homogeneity in six determinant variables. After the outbreak, there were more female residents who assimilated the concepts considered to be essential to understand the proposed behaviour. Nevertheless, no significant difference was observed in the number of female residents who achieved the defined 'minimal understanding''. Moreover, most of the population (95.5%) still believed at least in one of the identified myths. After the outbreak some myths disappeared and others appeared. The present study quantified and explored how the experience of an outbreak influenced the perception regarding a dengue-preventive behaviour. The outbreak experience surprisingly led to the appearance of new myths within the population, apart from the expected increase of relevant concepts' assimilation. Monitoring public perceptions is therefore crucial to make preventing dengue campaigns updated and worthy.","[Nazareth, Teresa; Porto, Graca] Univ Porto, Abel Salazar Inst Biomed Sci, ICBAS, GABBA Doctoral Program, P-4100 Oporto, Portugal; [Nazareth, Teresa; Teodosio, Rosa] Univ Nova Lisboa, Inst Higiene & Med Trop, Unidade Clin Trop, P-1200 Lisbon, Portugal; [Nazareth, Teresa; Sousa, Carla Alexandra; Seixas, Goncalo] Univ Nova Lisboa, Inst Higiene & Med Trop, Unidade Parasitol Med, P-1200 Lisbon, Portugal; [Sousa, Carla Alexandra] Univ Nova Lisboa, Inst Higiene & Med Trop, Unidade Parasitol & Microbiol Med, P-1200 Lisbon, Portugal; [Porto, Graca] Inst Mol & Cellular Biol, IBMC, Basic & Clin Res Iron Biol, Oporto, Portugal; [Goncalves, Luzia] Univ Nova Lisboa, Inst Higiene & Med Trop, Unidade Saude Publ & Int Bioestat, P-1200 Lisbon, Portugal; [Goncalves, Luzia] CEAUL, Lisbon, Portugal; [Silva, Ana Clara] Inst Adm Saude & Assuntos Sociais, Planeamento & Adm Geral, Dept Saude, Funchal, Regiao Autnoma, Portugal; [Antunes, Luis] Direcao Reg Ordenamento Terr & Ambiente, Direcao Serv Informacao Geografica & Cadastro, DROTA, Funchal, Regiao Autnoma, Portugal; [Teodosio, Rosa] Univ Nova Lisboa, Inst Higiene & Med Trop, Ctr Malaria & Doencas Trop, P-1200 Lisbon, Portugal","Nazareth, T (reprint author), Univ Porto, Abel Salazar Inst Biomed Sci, ICBAS, GABBA Doctoral Program, P-4100 Oporto, Portugal.",18casousa@gmail.com,"Seixas, Goncalo/L-7932-2019; Nazareth, Teresa/M-9767-2015; Goncalves, Luzia/J-6649-2012; Sousa, Carla/G-6531-2012; Seixas, Goncalo/F-9282-2014","Nazareth, Teresa/0000-0001-6535-3745; Goncalves, Luzia/0000-0002-9710-1945; Sousa, Carla/0000-0002-2386-7577; Seixas, Goncalo/0000-0001-5745-2153; Teodosio, Rosa/0000-0001-7330-6930; Porto, Graca/0000-0002-1923-4638","Science and Technology Foundation (Fundacao para a Ciencia e Tecnologia-FCT) [SFRH/BD/51012/2010, PTDC/SAU-EPI/115853/2009, PEST-OE/MAT/UI0006/2014]","The Science and Technology Foundation (Fundacao para a Ciencia e Tecnologia-FCT) funded this work, references: SFRH/BD/51012/2010, PTDC/SAU-EPI/115853/2009, and PEST-OE/MAT/UI0006/2014.

We conducted a randomized controlled field trial to evaluate the immunogenicity and safety of the new RVF Clone 13 vaccine, recently registered in South Africa. Methods In a blinded randomized controlled field trial, 404 animals (85 cattle, 168 sheep, and 151 goats) in three farms in Kenya were divided into three groups. Group A included males and non-pregnant females that were randomized and assigned to two groups; one vaccinated with RVF Clone 13 and the other given placebo. Groups B included animals in 1st half of pregnancy, and group C animals in 2nd half of pregnancy, which were also randomized and either vaccinated and given placebo. Animals were monitored for one year and virus antibodies titers assessed on days 14, 28, 56, 183 and 365. Results In vaccinated goats (N = 72), 72% developed anti-RVF virus IgM antibodies and 97% neutralizing IgG antibodies. In vaccinated sheep (N = 77), 84% developed IgM and 91% neutralizing IgG antibodies. Vaccinated cattle (N = 42) did not develop IgM antibodies but 67% developed neutralizing IgG antibodies. At day 14 post-vaccination, the odds of being seropositive for IgG in the vaccine group was 3.6 (95% CI, 1.5 - 9.2) in cattle, 90.0 (95% CI, 25.1 -579.2) in goats, and 40.0 (95% CI, 16.5 - 110.5) in sheep. Abortion was observed in one vaccinated goat but histopathologic analysis did not indicate RVF virus infection. There was no evidence of teratogenicity in vaccinated or placebo animals. Conclusions The results suggest RVF Clone 13 vaccine is safe to use and has high (>90%) immunogenicity in sheep and goats but moderate (>65%) immunogenicity in cattle.","[Njenga, M.

Virulent strains of these viruses are continually evolving and expanding their geographic range, thus rapid and sensitive screening assays are required to detect emerging viruses and monitor their prevalence and spread in mosquito populations. Double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) is produced during the replication of many of these viruses as either an intermediate in RNA replication (e. g., flaviviruses, togaviruses) or the double-stranded RNA genome (e. g., reoviruses). Detection and discovery of novel viruses from field and clinical samples usually relies on recognition of antigens or nucleotide sequences conserved within a virus genus or family. However, due to the wide antigenic and genetic variation within and between viral families, many novel or divergent species can be overlooked by these approaches. We have developed two monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) which show co-localised staining with proteins involved in viral RNA replication in immunofluorescence assay (IFA), suggesting specific reactivity to viral dsRNA. By assessing binding against a panel of synthetic dsRNA molecules, we have shown that these mAbs recognise dsRNA greater than 30 base pairs in length in a sequence-independent manner. IFA and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) were employed to demonstrate detection of a panel of RNA viruses from several families, in a range of cell types. These mAbs, termed monoclonal antibodies to viral RNA intermediates in cells (MAV-RIC), have now been incorporated into a high-throughput, economical ELISA-based screening system for the detection and discovery of viruses from mosquito populations. Our results have demonstrated that this simple system enables the efficient detection and isolation of a range of known and novel viruses in cells inoculated with field-caught mosquito samples, and represents a rapid, sequence-independent, and cost-effective approach to virus discovery.","[O'Brien, Caitlin A.; Hobson-Peter, Jody; Yam, Alice Wei Yee; Colmant, Agathe M.

Methodology/Principal Findings Rapid assessment procedure for loiasis (RAPLOA) was conducted in 12 communities covering the 3 senatorial districts of Osun State, Nigeria. A total of 960 people were interviewed for history of eye worm using the WHO guidelines for rapid assessment. The survey confirmed the presence of loiasis in all the 12 communities with 4 in Osun East/Ife south senatorial district being at high risk with a prevalence of over 40%. Based on the RAPLOA results, communities within Osun East/Ife south senatorial district were selected for microfilaraemic assessment of L. loa and O. volvulus. A total of 1115 and 1091 individuals were screened for L. loa and O. volvulus microfilaria worms respectively. 160 (14.3%) had L. loa microfilaria detected in their blood with 8 (5.0%) individuals having L. loa loads above 8000 mf/ml. 166 (15.2%) subjects had O. volvulus microfilaria (range 4-504 mf/ml) detected in their skin snip. 30 (2.69%) subjects were co-infected with both L. loa and O. volvulus. There was a significant variation in the prevalence (2.1% to 33.3%) of onchocerciasis in the communities studied (p = 0.001). Five (41.7%) of the studied communities had a prevalence that is equal to or greater than 20%. Conclusions/Significance Low prevalence of onchocerciasis and loiasis co-infection in this study suggests that loiasis may not pose a serious epidemiological threat to the continuous distribution and sustainability of ivermectin for the treatment of onchocerciasis. Evaluation of the interruption of onchocerciasis transmissions in this region using all the indicators set forth by WHO is therefore suggested.","[Ojurongbe, Olusola; Akindele, Akeem Abiodun; Oyedeji, Matthew Oyebode; Ojo, Josephine Folashade; Bolaji, Oloyede Samuel; Adefioye, Olusegun Adelowo; Adeyeba, Oluwaseyi Adegboyega] Ladoke Akintola Univ Technol, Dept Med Microbiol & Parasitol, Osogbo, Nigeria; [Akindele, Akeem Abiodun; Adedokun, Samuel Adeyinka; Akinleye, Callistus Adewale] Ladoke Akintola Univ Technol, Dept Community Med, Osogbo, Nigeria; [Adeleke, Monsuru Adebayo] Osun State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Osogbo, Nigeria","Ojurongbe, O (reprint author), Ladoke Akintola Univ Technol, Dept Med Microbiol & Parasitol, Osogbo, Nigeria.",oojurongbe@lautech.edu.ng,,"Akinleye, Callistus/0000-0003-3778-3638",Alexander von Humboldt (AVH) foundation Germany,"OO received return fellowship from Alexander von Humboldt (AVH) foundation Germany (2013/2014).

No vaccine is currently available. Previous reports indicate the importance of the O-antigen of Salmonella lipopolysaccharide for virulence and resistance to antibody-mediated killing. We hypothesised that isolates with more O-antigen have increased resistance to antibody-mediated killing and are more likely to be invasive than gastrointestinal. Methodology/Principal Findings We studied 192 NTS isolates (114 Typhimurium, 78 Enteritidis) from blood and stools, mostly from paediatric admissions in Kenya 2000-2011. Isolates were tested for susceptibility to antibody-mediated killing, using whole adult serum. O-antigen structural characteristics, including O-acetylation and glucosylation, were investigated. Overall, isolates were susceptible to antibody-mediated killing, but S. Enteritidis were less susceptible and expressed more O-antigen than Typhimurium (p<0.0001 for both comparisons). For S. Typhimurium, but not Enteritidis, O-antigen expression correlated with reduced sensitivity to killing (r = 0.29, 95% CI = 0.10-0.45, p = 0.002). Both serovars expressed O-antigen populations ranging 21-33 kDa average molecular weight. O-antigen from most Typhimurium were O-acetylated on rhamnose and abequose residues, while Enteritidis O-antigen had low or no O-acetylation. Both Typhimurium and Enteritidis O-antigen were approximately 20%-50% glucosylated. Amount of S. Typhimurium O-antigen and O-antigen glucosylation level were inversely related. There was no clear association between clinical presentation and antibody susceptibility, O-antigen level or other O-antigen features. Conclusion/Significance Kenyan S. Typhimurium and Enteritidis clinical isolates are susceptible to antibody-mediated killing, with degree of susceptibility varying with level of O-antigen for S. Typhimurium. This supports the development of an antibody-inducing vaccine against NTS for Africa. No clear differences were found in the phenotype of isolates from blood and stool, suggesting that the same isolates can cause invasive disease and gastroenteritis. Genome studies are required to understand whether invasive and gastrointestinal isolates differ at the genotypic level.","[Onsare, Robert S.; Kariuki, Samuel] Kenya Med Res Inst KEMRI, Ctr Microbiol Res CMR, Nairobi, Kenya; [Onsare, Robert S.; Muigai, Anne W.] Jomo Kenyatta Univ Agr & Technol JKUAT, Nairobi, Kenya; [Micoli, Francesca; Lanzilao, Luisa; Alfini, Renzo; Saul, Allan; MacLennan, Calman A.; Rondini, Simona] Novartis Vaccines Inst Global Hlth NVGH, Siena, Italy; [Okoro, Chinyere K.] Wellcome Trust Genome Campus, Wellcome Trust Sanger Inst, Cambridge, England; [Revathi, Gunturu] Aga Khan Univ Hosp, Dept Pathol, Div Microbiol, Nairobi, Kenya","Onsare, RS (reprint author), Kenya Med Res Inst KEMRI, Ctr Microbiol Res CMR, Nairobi, Kenya.",simona.rondini@novartis.com,"MacLennan, Calman/L-9343-2014; Saul, Allan/I-6968-2013","MacLennan, Calman/0000-0001-9694-0846; Saul, Allan/0000-0003-0665-4091",European GENDRIVAX project [PIAP-GA-2009-251522],"This work was supported through a PhD scholarship grant from the European GENDRIVAX project (Grant Agreement no.

Included among the neglected diseases, it is still insufficiently addressed by governments and the international community, despite formal surveillance and control programs. This study used a dataset of 10,112 rabies diagnoses in animals provided by the Brazilian passive surveillance system from 2001 to 2012. The positivity rate of the tested samples was 26.4%, and a reduction in the total samples sent during the last six years was observed. The kernel density map indicated case concentration in the south region and a decrease in density of rabies cases in the second period studied (2007 to 2012). The directional trend of positive rabies diagnoses remained in the south region, as shown by the standard deviational ellipse. The spatial scan statistic identified three large clusters of positive diagnoses, one in the first period (2001-2006) and two in the second period (2007-2012), indicating an expansion of risk areas. The decrease in rabies cases from 2006 to 2012 does not necessarily reflect lower viral circulation or improvement in actions by epidemiological surveillance; this decrease could indicate a deficiency in epidemiological surveillance during the observation period due to the increase in the silent areas. Surveillance should maintain an increasing or constant number of tests during the years in addition to a reduction in the number of outbreaks of rabies, which would indicate a lower positivity rate. The findings in this study indicate deterioration in the effectiveness of the passive surveillance for rabies. The number of rabies cases, total number of tests performed and positivity rate are good indicators for evaluating passive surveillance. This paper can function as a guide for the assessment and improvement of the actions in passive surveillance of rabies.","[Oviedo-Pastrana, Misael E.; Oliveira, Camila S.

Although national health structure-based cholera surveillance was rapidly initiated, a substantial number of community cases might have been missed, particularly in remote areas. We conducted a community-based survey in a large rural, mountainous area across four districts of the Nord department including areas with good versus poor accessibility by road, and rapid versus delayed response to the outbreak to document the true cholera burden and assess geographic distribution and risk factors for cholera mortality. Methodology/Principal Findings A two-stage, household-based cluster survey was conducted in 138 clusters of 23 households in four districts of the Nord Department from April 22nd to May 13th 2011. A total of 3,187 households and 16,900 individuals were included in the survey, of whom 2,034 (12.0%) reported at least one episode of watery diarrhea since the beginning of the outbreak. The two more remote districts, Borgne and Pilate were most affected with attack rates up to 16.2%, and case fatality rates up to 15.2% as compared to the two more accessible districts. Care seeking was also less frequent in the more remote areas with as low as 61.6% of reported patients seeking care. Living in remote areas was found as a risk factor for mortality together with older age, greater severity of illness and not seeking care. Conclusions/Significance These results highlight important geographical disparities and demonstrate that the epidemic caused the highest burden both in terms of cases and deaths in the most remote areas, where up to 5% of the population may have died during the first months of the epidemic. Adapted strategies are needed to rapidly provide treatment as well as prevention measures in remote communities.","[Page, Anne-Laure; Grandesso, Francesco; Polonsky, Jonathan; Nicholas, Sarala; Alberti, Kathryn P.; Porten, Klaudia; Luquero, Francisco J.] Epictr, Paris, France; [Ciglenecki, Iza; Desvignes, Laurence] Med Sans Frontieres, Geneva, Switzerland; [Jasmin, Ernest Robert] Minist Sante Publ & Populat, Cap Haitien, Haiti","Page, AL (reprint author), Epictr, Paris, France.",anne-laure.page@epicentre.msf.org,,"Polonsky, Jonathan/0000-0002-8634-4255",Medecins Sans Frontieres - Operational Center Geneva,"This work was supported by Medecins Sans Frontieres - Operational Center Geneva (www.msf.ch).

We determined the prevalence of bacterial enteropathogens in 831 children with acute diarrhoea over a four-year period in Yucatan, Mexico. Six DEC supplementary virulence genes (SVG), mainly associated with enteroaggregative E. coli (EAEC), were sought in 3100 E. coli isolates. DEC was the most common bacterial enteropathogen (28%), surpassing Salmonella (12%) and Shigella (9%). Predominant DEC groups were diffusely adherent E. coli (DAEC) (35%), EAEC (24%), and enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC) (19%). Among children with DEC infections, 14% had severe illness mainly caused by EPEC (26%) and DAEC (18%); 30% had moderate diarrhoea mainly caused by DAEC (36%), mixed DEC infections (33%) and EAEC (32%). DAEC was most prevalent during spring, while ETEC, EAEC and EPEC predominated in summer. EAEC wasmore frequent in children 6-24 months old than in those younger than 6months of age (P = 0.008, OR = 4.2, 95% CI, 1.3-13.9). The presence of SVG dispersin, (aatA), dispersin-translocator (aatA), enteroaggregative heat-stable toxin 1 (astA), plasmid encoded toxin (pet), cytolethal distending toxin (cdt) was higher in DEC than non-DEC strains, (36% vs 26%, P < 0.0001, OR = 1.5, 95% CI, 1.3-1.8). 98% of EAEC-infected children harboured strains with SVG; 85% carried the aap-aatA gene combination, and 33% of these also carried astA. 28% of both EPEC and ETEC, and 6% of DAEC patients had strains with SVG. 54% of EPEC patients carried pet-positive strains alone or in combination with astA; only this DEC group harboured cdt-positive isolates. All ETEC patients carried astA-or astA-aap-positive strains. astA and aap were themost common SVG in DAEC (3% and 2%) and non-DEC strains (21% and 13%). DEC carrying SVG are an important cause of moderate to severe bacterial diarrhoea in Mexican children.","[Patzi-Vargas, Sandra; Perez-Martinez, Iza; Estrada-Garcia, Teresa] CINVESTAV, IPN, Dept Mol Biomed, Mexico City 14000, DF, Mexico; [Bano Zaidi, Mussaret; Leon-Cen, Magda; Michel-Ayala, Alba] Hosp Gen OHoran, Microbiol Res Lab, Merida, Yucatan, Mexico; [Bano Zaidi, Mussaret; Leon-Cen, Magda; Michel-Ayala, Alba] Hosp Gen OHoran, Paediat Emergency Dept, Merida, Yucatan, Mexico; [Bano Zaidi, Mussaret] Hosp Reg Alta Especialidad Peninsula Yucatan, Infect Dis Res Unit, Merida, Yucatan, Mexico; [Chaussabel, Damien] Benaroya Res Inst, Dept Syst Immunol, Seattle, WA USA","Patzi-Vargas, S (reprint author), CINVESTAV, IPN, Dept Mol Biomed, Mexico City 14000, DF, Mexico.",testrada@cinvestav.mx,,"Chaussabel, Damien/0000-0002-6131-7242; perez-martinez, iza/0000-0002-2701-642X; Zaidi, Mussaret Bano/0000-0001-5342-2395","CONACyT (Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia) [128779, 230662]; National Institute of Health [U01AI082110]","This work was supported by CONACyT (Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia) grant 128779 to TEG and scholarship to SPV (230662), it also was supported by The National Institute of Health grant (U01AI082110) to MBZ, TEG, DC and scholarship to IPM.

Pentoxifylline (PTX), a phosphodiesterase inhibitor, has immunoregulatory and cardioprotective properties. Here, we tested PTX effects on CD8+ T-cell abnormalities and cardiac alterations using a model of experimental Chagas' heart disease. Methodology/Principal Findings C57BL/6 mice chronically infected by the Colombian Trypanosoma cruzi strain and presenting signs of CCC were treated with PTX. The downmodulation of T-cell receptors on CD8(+) cells induced by T. cruzi infection was rescued by PTX therapy. Also, PTX reduced the frequency of CD8(+) T-cells expressing activation and migration markers in the spleen and the activation of blood vessel endothelial cells and the intensity of inflammation in the heart tissue. Although preserved interferon-gamma production systemically and in the cardiac tissue, PTX therapy reduced the number of perforin(+) cells invading this tissue. PTX did not alter parasite load, but hampered the progression of heart injury, improving connexin 43 expression and decreasing fibronectin overdeposition. Further, PTX reversed electrical abnormalities as bradycardia and prolonged PR, QTc and QRS intervals in chronically infected mice. Moreover, PTX therapy improved heart remodeling since reduced left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy and restored the decreased LV ejection fraction. Conclusions/Significance PTX therapy ameliorates critical aspects of CCC and repositioned CD8(+) T-cell response towards homeostasis, reinforcing that immunological abnormalities are crucially linked, as cause or effect, to CCC. Therefore, PTX emerges as a candidate to treat the non-beneficial immune deregulation associated with chronic Chagas' heart disease and to improve prognosis.","[Pereira, Isabela Resende; Vilar-Pereira, Glaucia; Gibaldi, Daniel; Lannes-Vieira, Joseli] IOC Fiocruz, Lab Biol Interacoes, Rio De Janeiro, Brazil; [Moreira, Otacilio Cruz; Britto, Constanca] IOC Fiocruz, Lab Biol Mol & Doencas Endem, Rio De Janeiro, Brazil; [Ramos, Isalira Peroba] Univ Fed Rio de Janeiro, Inst Biofis Carlos Chagas Filho, Lab Cardiol Celular & Mol, Rio De Janeiro, Brazil; [Moraes, Milton Ozorio] IOC Fiocruz, Lab Hanseniase, Rio De Janeiro, Brazil","Pereira, IR (reprint author), IOC Fiocruz, Lab Biol Interacoes, Rio De Janeiro, Brazil.",lannes@ioc.fiocruz.br,"Moraes, Milton Ozorio/G-9753-2011; Britto, Constanca/L-7658-2016","Moraes, Milton Ozorio/0000-0003-2653-0037; Britto, Constanca/0000-0003-0788-7030","Fundacao Carlos Chagas Filho de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado do Rio de Janeiro/FAPERJ [9APQ1-E-26/111.756/2008, CNE/E-26/101.549/2010, E-26/110.153/2013, E-26/111.709/2013]; Brazilian Research Council/CNPq [474234/2012-6-Universal, 302534/2008-3, 403979/2012-9-DECIT]","This work was supported in part through grants from Fundacao Carlos Chagas Filho de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado do Rio de Janeiro/FAPERJ 9APQ1-E-26/111.756/2008, CNE/E-26/101.549/2010, E-26/110.153/2013, E-26/111.709/2013) and the Brazilian Research Council/CNPq (#474234/2012-6-Universal; #302534/2008-3; #403979/2012-9-DECIT).

We hypothesize that exposure to arsenic through drinking contaminated groundwater may be associated with SSG treatment failure due to the development of antimonyresistant parasites. Methods A retrospective cohort design was employed, as antimony treatment is no longer in routine use. The study was performed on patients treated with SSG between 2006 and 2010. Outcomes of treatment were assessed through a field questionnaire and treatment failure used as a proxy for parasite resistance. Arsenic exposure was quantified through analysis of 5 water samples from within and surrounding the patient's home. A logistic regression model was used to evaluate the association between arsenic exposure and treatment failure. In a secondary analysis survival curves and Cox regression models were applied to assess the risk of mortality in VL patients exposed to arsenic. Results One hundred and ten VL patients treated with SSG were analysed. The failure rate with SSG was 59%. Patients with high mean local arsenic level had a non-statistically significant higher risk of treatment failure (OR = 1.78, 95% CI: 0.7-4.6, p = 0.23) than patients using wells with arsenic concentration < 10 mu g/L. Twenty one patients died in our cohort, 16 directly as a result of VL. Arsenic levels >= 10 mu g/L increased the risk of all-cause (HR 3.27; 95% CI: 1.4-8.1) and VL related (HR 2.65; 95% CI: 0.96-7.65) deaths. This was time dependent: 3 months post VL symptom development, elevated risks of all-cause mortality (HR 8.56; 95% CI: 2.5-29.1) and of VL related mortality (HR 9.27; 95% CI: 1.8-49.0) were detected. Discussion/ Conclusion This study indicates a trend towards increased treatment failure in arsenic exposed patients. The limitations of the retrospective study design may have masked a strong association between arsenic exposure and selection for antimonial resistance in the field. The unanticipated strong correlation between arsenic exposure and VL mortality warrants further investigation.","[Perry, Meghan R.; Fairlamb, Alan H.] Univ Dundee, Coll Life Sci, Div Biol Chem & Drug Discovery, Dundee, Scotland; [Prajapati, Vijay K.] Cent Univ Rajasthan, Dept Biochem, Ajmer, Rajasthan, India; [Prajapati, Vijay K.; Sundar, Shyam] Banaras Hindu Univ, Inst Med Sci, Dept Med, Infect Dis Res Lab, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India; [Menten, Joris; Boelaert, Marleen] Inst Trop Med, Dept Publ Hlth, B-2000 Antwerp, Belgium; [Raab, Andrea; Feldmann, Joerg] Univ Aberdeen, Coll Phys Sci Chem, Trace Element Speciat Lab, Aberdeen, Scotland; [Chakraborti, Dipankar] Jadavpur Univ, Sch Environm Studies, Kolkata, India; [Picado, Albert] Univ Barcelona, Hosp Clin, Barcelona Ctr Int Hlth Res CRESIB, ISGlobal, Barcelona, Spain","Perry, MR (reprint author), Univ Dundee, Coll Life Sci, Div Biol Chem & Drug Discovery, Dundee, Scotland.",a.h.fairlamb@dundee.ac.uk,"Boelaert, Marleen/E-2698-2012; Prajapati, Vijay K/M-8539-2013; Fairlamb, Alan/A-5272-2009","Boelaert, Marleen/0000-0001-8051-6776; Prajapati, Vijay K/0000-0001-6510-0596; Feldmann, Joerg/0000-0002-0524-8254; Picado, Albert/0000-0001-7344-628X; Fairlamb, Alan/0000-0001-5134-0329","Wellcome Trust [090665, 079838]","This work was supported by a Clinical PhD Fellowship to MRP (090665) and a Principal Research Fellowship to AHF (079838) from the Wellcome Trust (http://www.wellcome.ac.uk).

This approach is associated with rates of relapse, defined as recurrence following the eradication phase, that can exceed 5%. Rates of recrudescence, defined as recurrence during the eradication phase, have not previously been reported. In response to low eradication phase completion rates in Australia, a local guideline has evolved over the last ten years recommending a longer minimum intensive phase duration for many cases of melioidosis. Methodology/Principal Findings This retrospective cohort study reviews antibiotic duration for the first episode of care for all patients diagnosed with melioidosis and surviving the intensive phase during a recent three year period in the tropical north of Australia's Northern Territory; we also review adherence to the current local guideline and treatment outcomes. Of 215 first episodes of melioidosis surviving the intensive phase, the median (interquartile range) intensive phase duration was 26 (14-34) days. One hundred and eight (50.2%) patients completed eradication therapy; 58 (27.0%) patients took no eradication therapy. At 28 months' follow-up, one (0.5%) relapse and eleven (5.1%) recrudescences had occurred. On exact logistic regression analysis, the only independent risk factors for recrudescence were self-discharge during the intensive phase (odds ratio 6.2 [95% confidence interval 1.2-30.0]) and septic shock (odds ratio 5.3 [95% confidence interval 1.1-25.7]). Conclusions/Significance Relapsed melioidosis is rare in patients who receive a minimum intensive phase duration specified by our guideline and extended according to clinical progress. Recrudescence rates may improve with reductions in rates of self-discharge. Given the low relapse rate despite a high rate of eradication therapy non-adherence, the duration and necessity of eradication therapy for different patients after guideline-concordant intensive therapy should be evaluated further.","[Pitman, Matthew C.; Luck, Tara; Marshall, Catherine S.; Anstey, Nicholas M.; Ward, Linda; Currie, Bart J.] Royal Darwin Hosp, Dept Infect Dis, Darwin, NT, Australia; [Ward, Linda; Currie, Bart J.] Charles Darwin Univ, Menzies Sch Hlth Res, Global & Trop Hlth Div, Darwin, NT 0909, Australia","Pitman, MC (reprint author), Royal Melbourne Hosp, Victorian Infect Dis Serv, Melbourne, Vic, Australia.",bart.currie@menzies.edu.au,,"Pitman, Matthew/0000-0001-9296-2159","Australian National Health and Medical Research Council [605820, 1046812]","This study was supported in part by the Australian National Health and Medical Research Council through Project Grants, numbers 605820 and 1046812, awarded to BJC.

Trachoma control programs offer an opportunity to test this hypothesis, as the World Health Organization has targeted trachoma for elimination as a public health concern by the year 2020. Local programs may benefit if a single survey could reveal whether infection was headed towards elimination. Using data from a previously-published 2009 survey, we test the hypothesis that Chlamydia trachomatis prevalence across 75 Tanzanian communities where trachoma had been documented to be disappearing is exponentially distributed. Methods/Findings We fit multiple continuous distributions to the Tanzanian data and found the exponential gave the best approximation. Model selection by Akaike Information Criteria (AICc) suggested the exponential distribution had the most parsimonious fit to the data. Those distributions which do not include the exponential as a special or limiting case had much lower likelihoods of fitting the observed data. 95% confidence intervals for shape parameter estimates of those distributions which do include the exponential as a special or limiting case were consistent with the exponential. Lastly, goodness-of-fit testing was unable to reject the hypothesis that the prevalence data came from an exponential distribution. Conclusions Models correctly predict that infection prevalence across communities where a disease is disappearing is best described by an exponential distribution. In Tanzanian communities where local control efforts had reduced the clinical signs of trachoma by 80% over 10 years, an exponential distribution gave the best fit to prevalence data. An exponential distribution has a relatively heavy tail, thus occasional high-prevalence communities are to be expected even when infection is disappearing. A single cross-sectional survey may be able to reveal whether elimination efforts are on-track.","[Rahman, Salman A.; Porco, Travis C.; Keenan, Jeremy D.; Lietman, Thomas M.] FI Proctor Fdn, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; [West, Sheila K.; Mkocha, Harran; Munoz, Beatriz] Johns Hopkins Univ, Dana Ctr Prevent Ophthalmol, Baltimore, MD USA; [Porco, Travis C.; Keenan, Jeremy D.; Lietman, Thomas M.] Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Ophthalmol, San Francisco, CA USA; [Porco, Travis C.; Lietman, Thomas M.] Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Epidemiol & Biostat, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA","Rahman, SA (reprint author), FI Proctor Fdn, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA.",tom.lietman@ucsf.edu,,,"NIGMS NIH HHS [U01 GM087728, 1-U01GM087728]",,,27,7,7,0,0,PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE,SAN FRANCISCO,"1160 BATTERY STREET, STE 100, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94111 USA",1935-2735,,,PLOS NEGLECT TROP D,Plos Neglect.

However, surveys conducted in 1975 and 1976 revealed a dramatic decline in LF endemicity in the absence of mass drug administration (MDA). The decline in prevalence was partly attributed to a significant reduction in mosquito density through the widespread use of insecticidal nets. Based on findings elsewhere that vector control alone can interrupt LF, we asked the question in 2013 whether the rapid scale up in the use of insecticidal nets in The Gambia had interrupted LF transmission. Methodology/Principal Finding We present here the results of three independently designed filariasis surveys conducted over a period of 17 years (1997-2013), and involving over 6000 subjects in 21 districts across all administrative divisions in The Gambia. An immunochromatographic (ICT) test was used to detectW. bancrofti antigen during all three surveys. In 2001, tests performed on stored samples collected between 1997 and 2000, in three divisions, failed to show positive individuals from two divisions that were previously highly endemic for LF, suggesting a decline towards extinction in some areas. Results of the second survey conducted in 2003 showed that LF was no longer endemic in 16 of 21 districts surveyed. The 2013 survey used a WHO recommended LF transmission verification tool involving 3180 6-7 year-olds attending 60 schools across the country. We demonstrated that transmission of W. bancrofti has been interrupted in all 21 districts. Conclusions We conclude that LF transmission may have been interrupted in The Gambia through the extensive use of insecticidal nets for malaria control for decades. The growing evidence for the impact of malaria vector control activities on parasite transmission has been endorsed by WHO through a position statement in 2011 on integrated vector management to control malaria and LF.","[Rebollo, Maria P.; Thomas, Brent; Kelly-Hope, Louise; Molyneux, David H.; Bockarie, Moses J.] Univ Liverpool, Liverpool Sch Trop Med, Dept Parasitol, Ctr Neglected Trop Dis, Liverpool L3 5QA, Merseyside, England; [Sambou, Sana Malang; Jaye, Momodou C.] Minist Hlth & Social Welf, Banjul, Gambia; [Biritwum, Nana-Kwadwo] Ghana Hlth Serv, Accra, Ghana; [Gonzalez Escalada, Alba] Rey Juan Carlos Univ, Madrid, Spain","Rebollo, MP (reprint author), Task Force Global Hlth, Neglected Trop Dis Support Ctr, Decatur, GA 30030 USA.",moses.bockarie@lstmed.ac.uk,,"Thomas, Brent/0000-0003-1118-5429","Centre for Neglected Tropical Diseases, Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine through (PO) from the Department for International Development (DFID) [40021437]; Medical Research Council [G1001337]","This study was supported by the Centre for Neglected Tropical Diseases, Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine, through funding (PO# 40021437) from the Department for International Development (DFID) awarded to MJB.

In 2006, Zanzibar stopped MDA against LF after five rounds of MDA revealed no microfilaraemic individuals during surveys at selected sentinel sites. We asked the question if LF transmission was truly interrupted in 2006 when MDA was stopped. Methodology/Principal Findings In line with ongoing efforts to shrink the LF map, we performed the WHO recommended transmission assessment surveys (TAS) in January 2012 to verify the absence of LF transmission on the main Zanzibar islands of Unguja and Pemba. Altogether, 3275 children were tested on both islands and 89 were found to be CFA positive; 70 in Pemba and 19 in Unguja. The distribution of schools with positive children was heterogeneous with pronounced spatial variation on both islands. Based on the calculated TAS cut-offs of 18 and 20 CFA positive children for Pemba and Unguja respectively, we demonstrated that transmission was still ongoing in Pemba where the cut-off was exceeded. Conclusions Our findings indicated ongoing transmission of LF on Pemba in 2012. Moreover, we presented evidence from previous studies that LF transmission was also active on Unguja shortly after stopping MDA in 2006. Based on these observations the government of Zanzibar decided to resume MDA against LF on both islands in 2013.","[Rebollo, Maria P.; Thomas, Brent; Bockarie, Moses J.] Univ Liverpool, Liverpool Sch Trop Med, Dept Parasitol, Ctr Neglected Trop Dis, Liverpool L3 5QA, Merseyside, England; [Mohammed, Khalfan A.; Ali, Said Mohammed] Minist Hlth, Zanzibar, Tanzania; [Ame, Shaali] Publ Hlth Lab IdC, Zanzibar, Tanzania; [Cano, Jorge] London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, London WC1, England; [Gonzalez Escalada, Alba] Rey Juan Carlos Univ, Madrid, Spain","Rebollo, MP (reprint author), Task Force Global Hlth, Neglected Trop Dis Support Ctr, Decatur, GA 30030 USA.",moses.bockarie@lstmed.ac.uk,"Cano, Jorge/E-2962-2016","Cano, Jorge/0000-0001-9864-5058; Thomas, Brent/0000-0003-1118-5429","Centre for Neglected Tropical Diseases, Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine from DFID; Medical Research Council [G1001337]","This study was supported by the Centre for Neglected Tropical Diseases, Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine, through funding from DFID.

Only few anthelmintic drugs are available up to now. A major obstacle for drug treatment is the different developmental stages and the varying host compartments during worm development. Anthelmintic drugs have been tested mainly on adult schistosomes or freshly transformed cercariae. Knowledge concerning the larval stages is lacking. Methodology/Principal Findings In this study, we used in vitro-grown schistosomula (aged between 2 to 14 days) to investigate drug effects of the three anthelmintics praziquantel, artemether, and oxamniquine. Further, we analyzed the antibody accessibility of two exemplary schistosome antigens SmCD59a and SmKK7, before and after drug treatment. Our results demonstrated that praziquantel applied at a concentration of 1 mu M inhibited development of all life stages. Application of 10 mu M praziquantel led to dramatic morphological changes of all schistosomula. Artemether at 1 and 10 mu M had differential effects depending on whether it was applied to 2-day as compared to 7- and 14-day schistosomula. While 2-day schistosomula were not killed but inhibited from further development, severe morphological damage was seen in 7- and 14-day schistosomula. Oxamniquine (1 and 10 mu M) led to severe morphological impairment in all life stages. Analyzing the accessibility of the antigens SmCD59a and SmKK7 before drug treatment showed no antibody binding on living intact schistosomula. However, when schistosomula were treated with anthelmintics, both antigens became exposed on the larvae. Oxamniquine turned out to be most effective in promoting antibody binding to all schistosomula stages. Conclusion This study has revealed marked differences in anthelmintic drug effects against larvae. Drug treatment increases surface antigen presentation and renders larvae accessible to antibody attack.","[Reimers, Natalie; Homann, Arne; Hoeschler, Beate; Langhans, Kristina; Haas, Helmut; Schramm, Gabriele] Res Ctr Borstel RCB, Prior Area Asthma & Allergy, Div Cellular Allergol, Borstel, Germany; [Wilson, R.

Antibodies (Abs) developed during primary infection protect against subsequent infection with the same dengue serotype, but can enhance disease following secondary infection with a heterologous serotype. A DENV virion has two surface proteins, envelope protein E and (pre)-membrane protein (pr)M, and inefficient cleavage of the prM protein during maturation of progeny virions leads to the secretion of immature and partially immature particles. Interestingly, we and others found that historically regarded non-infectious prM-containing DENV particles can become highly infectious in the presence of E-and prM-Abs. Accordingly, we hypothesized that these virions contribute to the exacerbation of disease during secondary infection. Here, we tested this hypothesis and investigated the ability of acute sera of 30 DENV2-infected patients with different grades of disease severity, to bind, neutralize and/or enhance immature DENV2. We found that a significant fraction of serum Abs bind to the prM protein and to immature virions, but we observed no significant difference between the disease severity groups. Furthermore, functional analysis of the Abs did not underscore any specific correlation between the neutralizing/enhancing activity towards immature DENV2 and the development of more severe disease. Based on our analysis of acute sera, we conclude that Abs binding to immature virions are not a discriminating factor in dengue pathogenesis.","[Rodenhuis-Zybert, Izabela A.; Voorham, Julia M. da Silva; Torres, Silvia; van de Pol, Denise; Smit, Jolanda M.] Univ Groningen, Univ Med Ctr Groningen, Dept Med Microbiol, Groningen, Netherlands","Rodenhuis-Zybert, IA (reprint author), Univ Groningen, Univ Med Ctr Groningen, Dept Med Microbiol, Groningen, Netherlands.",jolanda.smit@umcg.nl,"Rodenhuis-Zybert, Izabela A/N-7967-2017","Rodenhuis-Zybert, Izabela A/0000-0002-7820-8624",Pediatric Dengue Vaccine Initiative; Dutch Organization for Scientific research (NWO-Earth and Life Sciences); Dutch Organization for Scientific research (NWO-ZonMw),"This work was financially supported by the Pediatric Dengue Vaccine Initiative and by the Dutch Organization for Scientific research (NWO-Earth and Life Sciences and NWO-ZonMw).

Specific antivenoms are the only rational and effective therapy for these cases. Efforts are being made to produce effective, affordable and sufficient antivenoms for these victims. The immunization process, which has rarely been described in detail, is one step that needs to be rigorously studied and improved especially with regard to the production of polyspecific antisera. The polyspecific nature of therapeutic antivenom could obviate the need to identify the culprit snake species. The aim of this study was to produce potent polyspecific antisera against 3 medically important vipers of Thailand and its neighboring countries, namely Cryptelytrops albolabris ""White lipped pit viper"" (CA), Calleoselasma rhodostoma ""Malayan pit viper"" (CR), and Daboia siamensis ""Russell's viper"" (DS). Four horses were immunized with a mixture of the 3 viper venoms using the 'low dose, low volume multi-site' immunization protocol. The antisera showed rapid rise in ELISA titers against the 3 venoms and reached plateau at about the 8th week post-immunization. The in vivo neutralization potency (P) of the antisera against CA, CR and DS venoms was 10.40, 2.42 and 0.76 mg/ml, respectively and was much higher than the minimal potency limits set by Queen Soavabha Memorial Institute (QSMI). The corresponding potency values for the QSMI monospecific antisera against CA, CR and DS venoms were 7.28, 3.12 and 1.50 mg/ml, respectively. The polyspecific antisera also effectively neutralized the procoagulant, hemorrhagic, necrotic and nephrotoxic activities of the viper venoms. This effective immunization protocol should be useful in the production of potent polyspecific antisera against snake venoms, and equine antisera against tetanus, diphtheria or rabies.","[Sapsutthipas, Sompong; Ratanabanangkoon, Kavi] Mahidol Univ, Fac Sci, Dept Microbiol, Bangkok 10400, Thailand; [Leong, Poh Kuan] Univ Malaya, Fac Med, Dept Pharmacol, Kuala Lumpur 50603, Malaysia; [Akesowan, Surasak] Queen Saovabha Mem Inst, Bangkok, Thailand; Chiang Mai Univ, Fac Agroind, Div Biotechnol, Chaing Mai, Thailand; [Tan, Nget Hong] Univ Malaya, Fac Med, Mol Med, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia; [Ratanabanangkoon, Kavi] Chulabhorn Res Inst, Immunol Lab, Bangkok, Thailand; [Ratanabanangkoon, Kavi] Chulabhorn Grad Inst, Bangkok, Thailand","Sapsutthipas, S (reprint author), Mahidol Univ, Fac Sci, Dept Microbiol, Bangkok 10400, Thailand.",kavi@cri.or.th,"TAN, NGET HONG/B-9914-2010",,National Science and Technology Development Agency of Thailand [CPT 89B-1-05-143]; University of Malaya [UM.C/625/1/HIR/MOE/E00040-20001],"This study was funded by a grant from the National Science and Technology Development Agency of Thailand (CPT 89B-1-05-143) and a research grant from the University of Malaya UM.C/625/1/HIR/MOE/E00040-20001.

Many national malaria control programs recommend primaquine therapy without G6PD screening but with monitoring due to a broad lack of G6PD deficiency screening capacity. The degree of risk in doing so hinges upon the level of residual G6PD activity among the variants present in any given area. We conducted studies on Sumba Island in eastern Indonesia in order to assess the potential threat posed by primaquine therapy without G6PD screening. We sampled 2,033 residents of three separate districts in western Sumba for quantitative G6PD activity and 104 (5.1%) were phenotypically deficient (<4.6U/gHb; median normal 10U/gHb). The villages were in two distinct ecosystems, coastal and inland. A positive correlation occurred between the prevalence of malaria and G6PD deficiency: 5.9% coastal versus inland 0.2% for malaria (P<0.001), and 6.7% and 3.1% for G6PD deficiency (P<0.001) at coastal and inland sites, respectively. The dominant genotypes of G6PD deficiency were Vanua Lava, Viangchan, and Chatham, accounting for 98.5% of the 70 samples genotyped. Subjects expressing the dominant genotypes all had less than 10% of normal enzyme activities and were thus considered severe variants. Blind administration of anti-relapse primaquine therapy at Sumba would likely impose risk of serious harm.","[Satyagraha, Ari Winasti; Sadhewa, Arkasha; Baramuli, Vanessa; Elvira, Rosalie; Noviyanti, Rintis; Coutrier, Farah Novita; Harahap, Alida Roswita] Eijkman Inst Mol Biol, Jakarta, Indonesia; [Ridenour, Chase] No Arizona Univ, Flagstaff, AZ 86011 USA; [Elyazar, Iqbal; Baird, J.

Very little has been published on the costs of methods specifically targeting human African trypanosomiasis Methodology/Principal Findings In northern Uganda, a 250 km(2) field trial was undertaken using small (0.5 X 0.25 m) insecticide-treated targets (""tiny targets""). Detailed cost recording accompanied every phase of the work. Costs were calculated for this operation as if managed by the Ugandan vector control services: removing purely research components of the work and applying local salaries. This calculation assumed that all resources are fully used, with no spare capacity. The full cost of the operation was assessed at USD 85.4 per km(2), of which USD 55.7 or 65.2% were field costs, made up of three component activities (target deployment: 34.5%, trap monitoring: 10.6% and target maintenance: 20.1%). The remaining USD 29.7 or 34.8% of the costs were for preliminary studies and administration (tsetse surveys: 6.0%, sensitisation of local populations: 18.6% and office support: 10.2%). Targets accounted for only 12.9% of the total cost, other important cost components were labour (24.1%) and transport (34.6%). Discussion Comparison with the updated cost of historical HAT vector control projects and recent estimates indicates that this work represents a major reduction in cost levels. This is attributed not just to the low unit cost of tiny targets but also to the organisation of delivery, using local labour with bicycles or motorcycles. Sensitivity analyses were undertaken, investigating key prices and assumptions. It is believed that these costs are generalizable to other HAT foci, although in more remote areas, with denser vegetation and fewer people, costs would increase, as would be the case for other tsetse control techniques.","[Shaw, Alexandra P.

Antigen B (EgAgB), an abundant lipoprotein of the larval stage (hydatid cyst), is thought to be important in lipid storage and transport. It contains a wide variety of lipid classes, from highly hydrophobic compounds to phospholipids. Its protein component belongs to the cestode-specific Hydrophobic Ligand Binding Protein family, which includes five 8-kDa isoforms encoded by a multigene family (EgAgB1-EgAgB5). How lipid and protein components are assembled into EgAgB particles remains unknown. EgAgB apolipoproteins self-associate into large oligomers, but the functional contribution of lipids to oligomerization is uncertain. Furthermore, binding of fatty acids to some EgAgB subunits has been reported, but their ability to bind other lipids and transfer them to acceptor membranes has not been studied. Methodology/Principal Findings Lipid-free EgAgB subunits obtained by reverse-phase HPLC were used to analyse their oligomerization, ligand binding and membrane interaction properties. Size exclusion chromatography and cross-linking experiments showed that EgAgB8/2 and EgAgB8/3 can selfassociate, suggesting that lipids are not required for oligomerization. Furthermore, using fluorescent probes, both subunits were found to bind fatty acids, but not cholesterol analogues. Analysis of fatty acid transfer to phospholipid vesicles demonstrated that EgAgB8/2 and EgAgB8/3 are potentially capable of transferring fatty acids to membranes, and that the efficiency of transfer is dependent on the surface charge of the vesicles. Conclusions/Significance We show that EgAgB apolipoproteins can oligomerize in the absence of lipids, and can bind and transfer fatty acids to phospholipid membranes. Since imported fatty acids are essential for Echinococcus granulosus, these findings provide a mechanism whereby EgAgB could engage in lipid acquisition and/or transport between parasite tissues. These results may therefore indicate vulnerabilities open to targeting by new types of drugs for hydatidosis therapy.","[Silva-Alvarez, Valeria; Franchini, Gisela R.; Porfido, Jorge L.; Corsico, Betina] Univ Nacl La Plata, Fac Ciencias Med, CONICET, Inst Invest Bioquim La Plata INIBIOLP, RA-1900 La Plata, Buenos Aires, Argentina; [Silva-Alvarez, Valeria; Franchini, Gisela R.; Porfido, Jorge L.; Corsico, Betina] Consejo Nacl Invest Cient & Tecn, RA-1033 Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [Kennedy, Malcolm W.] Univ Glasgow, Coll Med Vet & Life Sci, Inst Mol Cell & Syst Biol, Glasgow, Lanark, Scotland; [Ferreira, Ana M.] Univ Republ UdelaR, Fac Quim, Fac Ciencias, Catedra Inmunol, Montevideo, Uruguay","Silva-Alvarez, V (reprint author), Univ Nacl La Plata, Fac Ciencias Med, CONICET, Inst Invest Bioquim La Plata INIBIOLP, RA-1900 La Plata, Buenos Aires, Argentina.",bcorsico@med.unlp.edu.ar,,"Silva Alvarez, Maria Valeria/0000-0003-3251-3823",Wellcome Trust [083625]; CSIC I+D Program [23-348]; CONICET (Argentina),"This study was supported by Wellcome Trust, grant number 083625 http://www.wellcome.ac.uk to BC and MWK and CSIC I+D Program, grant number 23-348 http://www.csic.edu.uy/ to AMF.

More generally, it has the potential to elucidate the complete human virome, including viruses that cause no overt symptoms of disease, but may have unrecognized immunological or developmental consequences. We have used NGS to identify RNA viruses in the blood of 195 patients with UAFI and compared them with those found in 328 apparently healthy (i. e., no overt signs of illness) control individuals, all from communities in southeastern Nigeria. Among UAFI patients, we identified the presence of nucleic acids from several well-characterized pathogenic viruses, such as HIV-1, hepatitis, and Lassa virus. In our cohort of healthy individuals, however, we detected the nucleic acids of two novel rhabdoviruses. These viruses, which we call Ekpoma virus-1 (EKV-1) and Ekpoma virus-2 (EKV-2), are highly divergent, with little identity to each other or other known viruses. The most closely related rhabdoviruses are members of the genus Tibrovirus and Bas-Congo virus (BASV), which was recently identified in an individual with symptoms resembling hemorrhagic fever. Furthermore, by conducting a serosurvey of our study cohort, we find evidence for remarkably high exposure rates to the identified rhabdoviruses. The recent discoveries of novel rhabdoviruses by multiple research groups suggest that human infection with rhabdoviruses might be common. While the prevalence and clinical significance of these viruses are currently unknown, these viruses could have previously unrecognized impacts on human health; further research to understand the immunological and developmental impact of these viruses should be explored. More generally, the identification of similar novel viruses in individuals with and without overt symptoms of disease highlights the need for a broader understanding of the human virome as efforts for viral detection and discovery advance.","[Stremlau, Matthew H.; Andersen, Kristian G.; Jiang, Pan-Pan; Yozwiak, Nathan L.; Gire, Stephen K.; Winnicki, Sarah; Sabeti, Pardis C.] Harvard Univ, Dept Organism & Evolutionary Biol, FAS Ctr Syst Biol, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Stremlau, Matthew H.; Andersen, Kristian G.; Jiang, Pan-Pan; Yozwiak, Nathan L.; Matranga, Christian B.; Yang, Xiao; Gire, Stephen K.; Winnicki, Sarah; Tariyal, Ridhi; Schaffner, Stephen F.; Levin, Joshua Z.; Sabeti, Pardis C.] Broad Inst, Cambridge, MA USA; [Folarin, Onikepe A.; Odia, Ikponmwonsa; Ehiane, Philomena E.; Omoniwa, Omowunmi; Omoregie, Omigie; Okokhere, Peter O.; Okogbenin, Sylvanus; Akpede, George O.; Asogun, Danny A.; Happi, Christian T.] Irrua Specialist Teaching Hosp, Inst Lassa Fever Res & Control, Irrua, Edo State, Nigeria; [Folarin, Onikepe A.; Happi, Christian T.] Redeemers Univ, Coll Nat Sci, Dept Biol Sci, Redemption City, Ogun State, Nigeria; [Grove, Jessica N.; Garry, Robert F.] Tulane Univ, Dept Microbiol & Immunol, New Orleans, LA 70118 USA; [Agbonlahor, Dennis E.] Lahor Res Labs & Med Ctr, Benin, Edo State, Nigeria; [Walker, Peter J.] CSIRO Anim Food & Hlth Sci, Australian Anim Hlth Lab, Geelong, Vic, Australia; [Tesh, Robert B.] Univ Texas Med Branch, Dept Pathol, Galveston, TX 77555 USA; [Sabeti, Pardis C.] Harvard Univ, Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Immunol & Infect Dis, Boston, MA 02115 USA","Stremlau, MH (reprint author), Harvard Univ, Dept Organism & Evolutionary Biol, FAS Ctr Syst Biol, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",stremlau@gmail.com; andersen@broadinstitute.org; pardis@broadinstitute.org; happic@run.edu.ng,"Walker, Peter/H-6059-2013; Schaffner, Stephen F/D-1189-2011","Walker, Peter/0000-0003-1851-642X; Happi, Christian/0000-0002-3056-6705; Levin, Joshua/0000-0002-0170-3598; Garry, Robert/0000-0002-5683-3250; Matranga, Christian/0000-0002-9037-5468","Larry Summers Fellowship; Carlsberg Foundation; Federal funds from the NIH, Department of Health and Human Services [NIH1DP2OD006514-01, HHSN272200900049C, HHSN272201000022C, 1U01HG007480 - 01]; Packard Foundation Fellowship for Science and Engineering; Broad Institute SPARC award;  [HHSN272200900018C];  [U01 AI082119-01];  [USAMRAA W81XWH-10-1-0098]","MHS was supported by the Larry Summers Fellowship and KGA by a fellowship from the Carlsberg Foundation.

Methodology/Principal Findings To assess the influence of pre-existing Wuchereria bancrofti infection on HIV progression, we performed a case-controlled treatment study of HIV positive individuals with (FIL+) or without (FIL-) W. bancrofti infection. Twenty-eight HIV+/FIL+ and 51 matched HIV+/FIL-subjects were treated with a single dose of diethylcarbamazine and albendazole (DEC/Alb) and followed for a year at regular intervals. Sixteen of the HIV+/FIL+ subjects (54%) and 28 of the HIV+/FIL-controls (57%) were on antiretroviral therapy (ART) during the study. Following treatment, no differences were noted in clinical outcomes between the 2 groups. There also was no significant difference between the groups in the HIV viral load at 12 months as a percentage of baseline viral load (HIV+/FIL+ group had on average 0.97 times the response of the HIV+/FIL-group, 95% CI 0.88, 1.07) between the groups. Furthermore, there were no significant differences found in either the change in viral load at 1, 3, or 6 months or in the change in CD4 count at 3, 6, or 12 months between the 2 groups. Conclusions/Significance We were unable to find a significant effect of W. bancrofti infection or its treatment on HIV clinical course or surrogate markers of HIV disease progression though we recognized that our study was limited by the smaller than predicted sample size and by the use of ART in half of the patients. Treatment ofW. bancrofti coinfection in HIV positive subjects (as is usual in mass drug administration campaigns) did not represent an increased risk to the subjects, and should therefore be considered for PLWHA living in W. bancrofti endemic areas.","[Talaat, Kawsar R.] NIAID, Parasit Dis Lab, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; [Talaat, Kawsar R.; Babu, Subash; Nutman, Thomas B.] Johns Hopkins Bloomberg Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Int Hlth, Baltimore, MD USA; [Menon, Pradeep; Dhakshinamurthy, Kalaivani; Srinivasan, Ramalingam; Swaminathan, Soumya] Indian Council Med Res, Natl Inst Res TB, Madras, Tamil Nadu, India; [Kumarasamy, N.; Sharma, Jabin; Arumugam, Jeeva; Poongulali, S.] YRG CARE, Madras, Tamil Nadu, India; [Gu, Wenjuan; Fay, Michael P.] NIAID, Div Clin Res, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA","Talaat, KR (reprint author), NIAID, Parasit Dis Lab, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA.",ktalaat@jhu.edu,,"Fay, Michael P./0000-0002-8643-9625","Division of Intramural Research, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, USA","This work was supported by the Division of Intramural Research, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, USA.

Socio-cultural determinants related to its control remain unclear. Studies in Africa have shown that the underuse of sanitary facilities and the widespread occurrence of free-roaming pigs are the major risk factors for porcine cysticercosis. The study objective was to assess the communities' perceptions, practices and knowledge regarding latrines in a T. solium endemic rural area in Eastern Zambia inhabited by the Nsenga ethno-linguistic group, and to identify possible barriers to their construction and use. A total of 21 focus group discussions on latrine use were organized separately with men, women and children, in seven villages of the Petauke district. The themes covered were related to perceived latrine availability (absence-presence, building obstacles) and perceived latrine use (defecation practices, latrine management, socio-cultural constraints). The findings reveal that latrines were not constructed in every household because of the convenient use of existing latrines in the neighborhood. Latrines were perceived to contribute to good hygiene mainly because they prevent pigs from eating human feces. Men expressed reluctance to abandon the open-air defecation practice mainly because of toilet-associated taboos with in-laws and grown-up children of the opposite gender. When reviewing conceptual frameworks of people's approach to sanitation, we found that seeking privacy and taboos hindering latrine use and construction were mainly explained in our study area by the fact that the Nsenga observe a traditionally matrilineal descent. These findings indicate that in this local context latrine promotion messages should not only focus on health benefits in general. Since only men were responsible for building latrines and mostly men preferred open defecation, sanitation programs should also be directed to men and address related sanitary taboos in order to be effective.","[Thys, Severine; Lefevre, Pierre] Inst Trop Med, Dept Publ Hlth, B-2000 Antwerp, Belgium; [Mwape, Kabemba E.; Phiri, Andrew M.; Phiri, Isaak K.] Univ Zambia UNZA, Sch Vet Med, Lusaka, Zambia; [Mwape, Kabemba E.] Univ Pretoria, Fac Vet Sci, Dept Vet Trop Dis, ZA-0110 Onderstepoort, South Africa; [Dorny, Pierre; Gabriel, Sarah] Inst Trop Med, Dept Biomed Sci, B-2000 Antwerp, Belgium; [Marcotty, Tanguy] VERDI R&D, Louveigne, Belgium","Thys, S (reprint author), Inst Trop Med, Dept Publ Hlth, B-2000 Antwerp, Belgium.",sthys@itg.be,"Dorny, Pierre/B-8590-2008","Phiri, Andrew/0000-0002-8924-193X",ITM; Belgian Development Cooperation,"The financial support for the conduct of the research and/or preparation of the article is the Strategic Network on Neglected Diseases and Zoonoses (http://www.snndz.net/) which is an initiative from the Institute of Tropical Medicine (Antwerp, Belgium) (ITM) funded by the Third Framework Agreement between the ITM and the Belgian Development Cooperation.

One of the most economical and effective methods of tsetse control is the use of insecticide-treated screens, called targets, that simulate hosts. Targets have been similar to 1m(2), but recently it was shown that those tsetse that occupy riverine situations, and which are the main vectors of sleeping sickness, respond well to targets only similar to 0.06m(2). The cheapness of these tiny targets suggests the need to reconsider what intensity and duration of target deployments comprise the most cost-effective strategy in various riverine habitats. Methodology/Principal Findings A deterministic model, written in Excel spreadsheets and managed by Visual Basic for Applications, simulated the births, deaths and movement of tsetse confined to a strip of riverine vegetation composed of segments of habitat in which the tsetse population was either self-sustaining, or not sustainable unless supplemented by immigrants. Results suggested that in many situations the use of tiny targets at high density for just a few months per year would be the most cost-effective strategy for rapidly reducing tsetse densities by the similar to 90% expected to have a great impact on the incidence of sleeping sickness. Local elimination of tsetse becomes feasible when targets are deployed in isolated situations, or where the only invasion occurs from populations that are not self-sustaining. Conclusion/Significance Seasonal use of tiny targets deserves field trials. The ability to recognise habitat that contains tsetse populations which are not self-sustaining could improve the planning of all methods of tsetse control, against any species, in riverine, savannah or forest situations. Criteria to assist such recognition are suggested.","[Vale, Glyn A.] Univ Greenwich, Nat Resources Inst, Chatham, Kent, England; [Vale, Glyn A.; Hargrove, John W.] Univ Stellenbosch, South African Ctr Epidemiol Modelling & Anal, ZA-7600 Stellenbosch, South Africa; [Lehane, Michael J.; Torr, Stephen J.] Univ Liverpool, Liverpool Sch Trop Med, Liverpool L3 5QA, Merseyside, England; [Solano, Philippe] IRD, UMR Intertryp IRD Cirad 177, Montpellier, France; [Torr, Stephen J.] Univ Warwick, Warwick Med Sch, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England","Vale, GA (reprint author), Univ Greenwich, Nat Resources Inst, Chatham, Kent, England.",valeglyn@gmail.com,"solano, philippe/B-2328-2010; Torr, Stephen/N-7161-2016","solano, philippe/0000-0002-4351-3506; Torr, Stephen/0000-0001-9550-4030",Zoonoses and Emerging Livestock Systems [BB/L019035/1]; Special Programme for Research and Training in Tropical Diseases,"This study was funded by Zoonoses and Emerging Livestock Systems, grant number BB/L019035/1, to SJT, and by The Special Programme for Research and Training in Tropical Diseases, with no grant number, to JWH.

Treatment of cattle with pyrethroids to kill tsetse as they feed is the most cost-effective method. However, such treatments can contaminate cattle dung, thereby killing the fauna which disperse the dung and so play an important role in soil fertility. Hence there is a need to identify cost-effective methods of treating cattle with minimal impact on dung fauna. Methodology/Principal Findings We used dung beetles to field bioassay the levels of dung contamination following the use of spray and pour-on formulations of deltamethrin, applied to various parts of the body of cattle in Zimbabwe. Results suggested that dung was contaminated by contact with insecticide on the body surface as the cattle defecated, and by ingestion of insecticide as the cattle licked themselves. Death of dung beetles was reduced to negligible levels by using only the spray and applying it to the legs and belly or legs alone, i.e., places where most tsetse feed. Conclusion/Significance The restricted applications suitable for minimising the impact on dung fauna have the collateral benefits of improving the economy and convenience of cattle treatments for tsetse control. The demonstration of collateral benefits is one of the surest ways of promoting environmentally friendly procedures.","[Vale, Glyn A.; Grant, Ian F.] Univ Greenwich, Nat Resources Inst, Chatham, Kent, England; [Vale, Glyn A.; Hargrove, John W.] Univ Stellenbosch, South African Ctr Epidemiol Modelling & Anal, ZA-7600 Stellenbosch, South Africa; [Chamisa, Andrew] Div Tsetse Control, Harare, Zimbabwe; [Torr, Stephen J.] Univ Liverpool, Liverpool Sch Trop Med, Liverpool L3 5QA, Merseyside, England; [Torr, Stephen J.] Univ Warwick, Warwick Med Sch, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England","Vale, GA (reprint author), Univ Greenwich, Nat Resources Inst, Chatham, Kent, England.",valeglyn@gmail.com,"Torr, Stephen/N-7161-2016","Torr, Stephen/0000-0001-9550-4030","DFID Animal Health Programme [R7539, R7987]; DFID/RCUK programme on Zoonoses and Emerging Livestock Systems (ZELS, BBSRC) [BB/L019035/1]; ICEF/UNDP/World Bank/WHO Special Programme for Research and Training in Tropical Diseases (TDR); Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council [BB/L019035/1]","Financial support was received from the DFID Animal Health Programme (Project nos.

The aim of this study is to investigate the kinetics of the transcriptome signature changes during the course of disease and the association of genes in these signatures with clinical parameters. Methodology/Principle Findings Sequential whole blood samples from DENV infected patients in Jakarta were profiled using affymetrix microarrays, which were analysed using principal component analysis, limma, gene set analysis, and weighted gene co-expression network analysis. We show that time since onset of disease, but not diagnosis, has a large impact on the blood transcriptome of patients with non-severe dengue. Clinical diagnosis (according to the WHO classification) does not associate with differential gene expression. Network analysis however, indicated that the clinical markers platelet count, fibrinogen, albumin, IV fluid distributed per day and liver enzymes SGOT and SGPT strongly correlate with gene modules that are enriched for genes involved in the immune response. Overall, we see a shift in the transcriptome from immunity and inflammation to repair and recovery during the course of a DENV infection. Conclusions/Significance Time since onset of disease associates with the shift in transcriptome signatures from immunity and inflammation to cell cycle and repair mechanisms in patients with non-severe dengue. The strong association of time with blood transcriptome changes hampers both the discovery as well as the potential application of biomarkers in dengue. However, we identified gene expression modules that associate with key clinical parameters of dengue that reflect the systemic activity of disease during the course of infection. The expression level of these gene modules may support earlier detection of disease progression as well as clinical management of dengue.","[van de Weg, Cornelia A.

In contrast, relatively little is known about morbidity levels in preschool-aged children (<= 5 years) who have been neglected in terms of schistosome research and control. The aim of this study was to compare the utility of available point-of-care (POC) morbidity diagnostic tools in preschool versus primary school-aged children (6-10 years) and determine markers which can be used in the field to identify and quantify Schistosoma haematobium-related morbidity. Methods/Principal Findings A comparative cross-sectional study was conducted to evaluate the performance of currently available POC morbidity diagnostic tools on Zimbabwean children aged 1-5 years (n= 104) and 6-10 years (n= 194). Morbidity was determined using the POC diagnostics questionnaire-based reporting of haematuria and dysuria, clinical examination, urinalysis by dipsticks, and urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio (UACR). Attributable fractions were used to quantify the proportion of morbidity attributable to S. haematobium infection. Based on results of attributable fractions, UACR was identified as the most reliable tool for detecting schistosome-related morbidity, followed by dipsticks, visual urine inspection, questionnaires, and lastly clinical examination. The results of urine dipstick attributes showed that proteinuria and microhaematuria accounted for most differences between schistosome egg-positive and negative children (T=-50.1; p< 0.001). These observations were consistent in preschool vs. primary school-aged children. Conclusions/Significance Preschool-aged children in endemic areas can be effectively screened for schistosome-related morbidity using the same currently available diagnostic tools applicable to older children. UACR for detecting albuminuria is recommended as the best choice for rapid assessment of morbidity attributed to S. haematobium infection in children in the field. The use of dipstick microhaematuria and proteinuria as additional indicators of schistosome-related morbidity would improve the estimation of disease burden in young children.","[Wami, Welcome M.; Nausch, Norman; Mutapi, Francisca] Univ Edinburgh, Inst Immunol & Infect Res, Sch Biol Sci, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland; [Wami, Welcome M.; Nausch, Norman; Woolhouse, Mark; Mutapi, Francisca] Univ Edinburgh, Sch Biol Sci, Ctr Immun Infect & Evolut, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland; [Midzi, Nicholas] Natl Inst Hlth Res, Harare, Zimbabwe; [Gwisai, Reggis] Murewa Dist Hosp, Minist Hlth & Child Care, Murewa, Zimbabwe; [Mduluza, Takafira] Univ Zimbabwe, Dept Biochem, Harare, Zimbabwe","Wami, WM (reprint author), Univ Edinburgh, Inst Immunol & Infect Res, Sch Biol Sci, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland.",W.M.Wami@sms.ed.ac.uk,"Nausch, Norman/L-9276-2013; Nausch, Norman/M-4526-2019","Nausch, Norman/0000-0002-9704-2148; Nausch, Norman/0000-0002-9704-2148; Mutapi, Francisca/0000-0002-2537-3466; Wami, Welcome M./0000-0002-1800-1584",Wellcome Trust [WT082028MA]; Thrasher Research Funds [9150],"This work was supported by the Wellcome Trust (Grant number WT082028MA, http://www.wellcome.ac.uk/funding/) and by Thrasher Research Funds (Grant number 9150, https://www.thrasherresearch.org/default.aspx).

In 2013, a large outbreak of DENV occurred in the city of Zhongshan, located in Southern China, which provided an opportunity to assess the clinical spectrum of disease. During the outbreak, an investigation of 887 index case contacts was conducted to evaluate inapparent and symptomatic DENV infections. Post-outbreak, an additional 815 subjects from 4 towns with, and 350 subjects from 2 towns without reported autochthonous DENV transmission, as determined by clinical diagnosis, were evaluated for serological evidence of dengue IgG antibodies. Between July and November 2013, there were 19 imported and 809 autochthonous dengue cases reported in Zhongshan. Of 887 case contacts enrolled during the outbreak, 13 (1.5%) exhibited symptomatic DENV infection, while 28 (3.2%) were inapparent. The overall I: S ratio was 2.2: 1 (95% CI: 1.1-4.2: 1). Post-outbreak serological data showed that the proportion of DENV IgG antibody detection from the 4 towns with and the 2 towns without reported DENV transmission was 2.7% (95% CI: 1.6%-3.8%) and 0.6% (95% CI: 0-1.4%), respectively. The I: S ratio in the 3 towns where clinical dengue cases were predominately typed as DENV-1 was 11.0: 1 (95% CI: 3.7-infinity: 1). The ratio in the town where DENV-3 was predominately typed was 1.0: 1 (95% CI: 0.5-infinity: 1). In this cross-sectional study, data suggests a high I: S ratio during a documented outbreak in Zhongshan, Southern China. These results have important implications for dengue control, implying that inapparent cases might influence DENV transmission more than previously thought.","[Wang, Tao; Wang, Man; Shu, Bo; Chen, Xue-qin; Luo, Le; Wang, Jin-yu; Cen, Yong-zhuang] Zhongshan Ctr Dis Control & Prevent, Zhongshan, Peoples R China; [Wang, Tao; Lu, Jia-hai] Sun Yat Sen Univ, Sch Publ Hlth, Zhongshan Inst, Zhongshan, Peoples R China; [Anderson, Benjamin D.] Duke Univ, Dept Med, Div Infect Dis, Durham, NC USA; [Merrill, Mary M.] Univ Florida, Dept Environm & Global Hlth, Coll Publ Hlth & Hlth Profess, Gainesville, FL USA; [Merrill, Hunter R.] Univ Florida, Dept Stat, Coll Liberal Arts & Sci, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; [Lu, Jia-hai] Sun Yat Sen Univ, Sch Publ Hlth, Guangzhou 510275, Guangdong, Peoples R China","Wang, T (reprint author), Zhongshan Ctr Dis Control & Prevent, Zhongshan, Peoples R China.",wangtao.cdc@gmail.com; lujiahai@mail.sysu.edu.cn,,,,,,31,19,20,0,8,PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE,SAN FRANCISCO,"1160 BATTERY STREET, STE 100, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94111 USA",1935-2735,,,PLOS NEGLECT TROP D,Plos Neglect.

To control the disease, annual dog vaccination campaigns have been implemented to vaccinate all dogs free of charge. Nevertheless, the uptake rate of the vaccination campaigns has been low. The objective of this paper is to identify risk factors associated with the uptake of rabies control measures by individual dog owners in Flores Island. Methodology/principal findings A total of 450 dog owners from 44 randomly selected villages in the Sikka and Manggarai regencies were interviewed regarding their socio-demographic factors, knowledge of rabies, and their uptake of rabies control measures. The majority of dog owners surveyed (>90%) knew that rabies is a fatal disease and that it can be prevented. Moreover, 68% of the dog owners had a high level of knowledge about available rabies control measures. Fifty-two percent of the dog owners had had at least one of their dogs vaccinated during the 2012 vaccination campaign. Vaccination uptake was significantly higher for dog owners who resided in Sikka, kept female dogs for breeding, had an income of more than one million Rupiah, and had easy access to their village. The most important reasons not to join the vaccination campaign were lack of information about the vaccination campaign schedule (40%) and difficulty to catch the dog during the vaccination campaign (37%). Conclusions/significance Dog owners in Flores Island had a high level of knowledge of rabies and its control, but this was not associated with uptake of the 2012 vaccination campaign. Geographical accessibility was one of the important factors influencing the vaccination uptake among dog owners.

The relative contribution of new P. vivax infection and reactivation of dormant liver stage hypnozoites to initiation of blood stage infection is unclear. In this study, we investigate the contribution of new inoculations of P. vivax sporozoites to primary infection versus reactivation of hypnozoites by modeling the dynamics of P. vivax infection in Thailand in patients receiving treatment for either blood stage infection alone (chloroquine), or the blood and liver stages of infection (chloroquine + primaquine). In addition, we also analysed rates of infection in a study in Papua New Guinea (PNG) where patients were treated with either artesunate, or artesunate + primaquine. Our results show that up to 96% of the P. vivax infection is due to hypnozoite reactivation in individuals living in endemic areas in Thailand. Similar analysis revealed the around 70% of infections in the PNG cohort were due to hypnozoite reactivation. We show how the age of the cohort, primaquine drug failure, and seasonality may affect estimates of the ratio of primary P. vivax infection to hypnozoite reactivation. Modeling of P. vivax primary infection and hypnozoite reactivation provides important insights into infection dynamics, and suggests that 90-96% of blood stage infections arise from hypnozoite reactivation. Major differences in infection kinetics between Thailand and PNG suggest the likelihood of drug failure in PNG.","[Adekunle, Adeshina I.; Pinkevych, Mykola; Cromer, Deborah; Davenport, Miles P.] UNSW Australia, Ctr Vasc Res, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [McGready, Rose; Luxemburger, Christine; Nosten, Francois] Mahidol Univ, Fac Trop Med, Mahidol Oxford Trop Med Res Unit, Shoklo Malaria Res Unit, Mae Sot, Thailand; [McGready, Rose; White, Lisa J.; Nosten, Francois] Univ Oxford, Ctr Trop Med, Nuffield Dept Med, Oxford, England; [White, Lisa J.] Mahidol Univ, Fac Trop Med, Mahidol Oxford Trop Med Res Unit, Bangkok, Thailand","Adekunle, AI (reprint author), UNSW Australia, Ctr Vasc Res, Sydney, NSW, Australia.",m.davenport@unsw.edu.au,"McGready, Rose/A-3290-2014","McGready, Rose/0000-0003-1621-3257; Davenport, Miles/0000-0002-4751-1831; Adekunle, Adeshina/0000-0002-1811-1310; White, Lisa/0000-0002-6523-185X; Nosten, Francois/0000-0002-7951-0745",Australian Research Council [DP120100064]; National Health and Medical Research Council [APP630542]; Wellcome Trust of Great Britain,"This work is funded by the Australian Research Council DP120100064 (MPD and DC).

Searches of published literature in epidemiological studies of dengue disease encompassing the terms ""dengue"", ""epidemiology,"" and ""Colombia"" were conducted. Studies in English or Spanish published between 1 January 2000 and 23 February 2012 were included. The searches identified 225 relevant citations, 30 of which fulfilled the inclusion criteria defined in the review protocol. The epidemiology of dengue disease in Colombia was characterized by a stable ""baseline"" annual number of dengue fever cases, with major outbreaks in 2001-2003 and 2010. The geographical spread of dengue disease cases showed a steady increase, with most of the country affected by the 2010 outbreak. The majority of dengue disease recorded during the review period was among those <15 years of age. Gaps identified in epidemiological knowledge regarding dengue disease in Colombia may provide several avenues for future research, namely studies of asymptomatic dengue virus infection, primary versus secondary infections, and under-reporting of the disease. Improved understanding of the factors that determine disease expression and enable improvement in disease control and management is also important.","[Angel Villar, Luis; Patricia Rojas, Diana] Univ Ind Santander, Sch Med, Clin Epidemiol Unit, Bucaramanga, Colombia; [Besada-Lombana, Sandra] Sanofi Pasteur LATAM, Dengue Med Direct, Bogota, Colombia; [Sarti, Elsa] Sanofi Pasteur LATAM, Epidemiol Direct, Mexico City, DF, Mexico","Villar, LA (reprint author), Univ Ind Santander, Sch Med, Clin Epidemiol Unit, Bucaramanga, Colombia.",luisangelvillarc@gmail.com,,,Sanofi Pasteur,"Sanofi Pasteur sponsored this survey and analysis.

Collectin Kidney 1 (CL-K1, encoded by COLEC11 on chromosome 2p25.3), a member of the vertebrate C-type lectin super family, has recently been identified as pattern-recognition molecule (PRR) of the lectin complement pathway. CL-K1 is preferentially expressed in the kidneys, but also in other organs and it is considered to play a role in host defense to some infectious agents. Schistosome teguments are fucosylated and CL-K1 has, through its collagen-like domain, a high binding affinity to fucose. Methodology/Principal Findings We utilized a Nigerian study group consisting of 167 Schistosoma haematobium infected individuals and 186 matched healthy subjects, and investigated the contribution of CL-K1 deficiency and of COLEC11 polymorphisms to infection phenotype. Higher CL-K1 serum levels were associated with decreased risk of schistosome infection (P-corr = 0.0004). CL-K1 serum levels were differentially distributed between the COLEC11 genotypes and haplotypes observed. The non-synonymous variant p. R216H was associated with the occurrence of schistosomiasis (OR = 0.44, 95% CI = 0.22-0.72, P-corr = 0.0004). The reconstructed COLEC11* TCCA haplotypes were associated with higher CL-K1 serum levels (P = 0.002) and with decreased schistosomiasis (OR = 0.38, 95% CI = 0.23-0.63, P-corr = 0.0001). Conclusions In agreement with findings from our earlier published study, our findings support the observation that CL-K1 and their functional variants may be host factors associated with protection in schistosomiasis and may be a useful marker for further investigations.","[Antony, Justin S.; Ojurongbe, Olusola; Kremsner, Peter G.; Velavan, Thirumalaisamy P.] Univ Tubingen, Inst Trop Med, Tubingen, Germany; [Ojurongbe, Olusola] Ladoke Akintola Univ Technol, Ogbomosho, Nigeria; [Velavan, Thirumalaisamy P.] Fdn Congolaise Rech Med, Brazzaville, Rep Congo","Antony, JS (reprint author), Univ Tubingen, Inst Trop Med, Tubingen, Germany.",velavan@medizin.uni-tuebingen.de,"Velavan, Thirumalaisamy/C-1223-2010; ANTONY, JUSTIN S/F-3994-2010","Velavan, Thirumalaisamy/0000-0002-9809-9883; ",Institutional internal grant; Alexander von Humboldt foundation; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG); Open Access Publishing Fund of Tuebingen University,"This study was funded by an Institutional internal grant to TPV.

An effective vaccine for humans is not yet available and the severe side-effects of the drugs in clinical use, linked to the parenteral administration route of most of them, are significant concerns of the current leishmanicidal medicines. New drugs are desperately needed to treat VL and phenotype-based High Throughput Screenings (HTS) appear to be suitable to achieve this goal in the coming years. Methodology/Principal findings We generated two infrared fluorescent L. infantum strains, which stably overexpress the IFP 1.4 and iRFP reporter genes and performed comparative studies of their biophotonic properties at both promastigote and amastigote stages. To improve the fluorescence emission of the selected reporter in intracellular amastigotes, we engineered distinct constructs by introducing regulatory sequences of differentially-expressed genes (A2, AMASTIN and HSP70 II). The final strain that carries the iRFP gene under the control of the L. infantum HSP70 II downstream region (DSR), was employed to perform a phenotypic screening of a collection of small molecules by using ex vivo splenocytes from infrared-infected BALB/c mice. In order to further investigate the usefulness of this infrared strain, we monitored an in vivo infection by imaging BALB/c mice in a time-course study of 20 weeks. Conclusions/Significance The near-infrared fluorescent L. infantum strain represents an important step forward in bioimaging research of VL, providing a robust model of phenotypic screening suitable for HTS of small molecule collections in the mammalian parasite stage. Additionally, HSP70 II+ L. infantum strain permitted for the first time to monitor an in vivo infection of VL. This finding accelerates the possibility of testing new drugs in preclinical in vivo studies, thus supporting the urgent and challenging drug discovery program against this parasitic disease.","[Calvo-Alvarez, Estefania; Alvarez-Velilla, Raquel; Tejeria, Ana; Miguel Escudero-Martinez, Jose; Perez-Pertejo, Yolanda; Balana-Fouce, Rafael; Reguera, Rosa M.] Univ Leon, Dept Ciencias Biomed, E-24071 Leon, Spain; [Stamatakis, Kostantinos; Fresno, Manuel] Univ Autonoma Madrid, Ctr Biol Mol Severo Ochoa, Madrid, Spain; [Punzon, Carmen] Diomune, Madrid, Spain","Calvo-Alvarez, E (reprint author), Univ Leon, Dept Ciencias Biomed, Campus Vegazana, E-24071 Leon, Spain.",rbalf@unileon.es,"Balana-Fouce, Rafael/K-4890-2014; Reguera, Rosa M/K-6027-2017; Stamatakis, Konstantinos/A-6596-2017","Balana-Fouce, Rafael/0000-0003-0418-6116; Reguera, Rosa M/0000-0001-9148-2997; Stamatakis, Konstantinos/0000-0001-9934-3502; Alvarez-Velilla, Raquel/0000-0003-4334-8392; perez-pertejo, yolanda/0000-0003-2361-3785","Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad [AGL2010-16078/GAN, CYTED 214RT0482]; Instituto de Salud Carlos III [PI12/00104, RICET RD12/0018/0004]; Junta de Castilla y Leon [Gr238, LE182U13]; European Commision [HOMIN - 317057-FP7-PEOPLE-2012-ITN]; BIOIMID Proyecto de Excelencia Instituto Sanitario ""La Princesa""; Fundacion Ramon Areces; AECC Foundation","This research was supported by Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad (www.mineco.gob.es) grants AGL2010-16078/GAN to RBF and CYTED 214RT0482 to RMR; Instituto de Salud Carlos III (www.isciii.es) grants PI12/00104 to RMR and RICET RD12/0018/0004 to MF; Junta de Castilla y Leon (www.jcyl.es) grants Gr238 and LE182U13; European Commision (cordis.europa.eu/home_es.html), grant HOMIN - 317057-FP7-PEOPLE-2012-ITN and BIOIMID (http://www.fundacionareces.es) Proyecto de Excelencia Instituto Sanitario ""La Princesa"" and Fundacion Ramon Areces to MF.

This is even more important to understand when dealing with important neglected diseases and their vectors. Methodology/Principal Findings In this paper, we analysed genetic divergence, computed from seven microsatellite loci, of 614 tsetse flies (Glossina palpalis gambiensis and Glossina palpalis palpalis, major vectors of animal and human trypanosomes) from 28 sites of West and Central Africa. We found that the two subspecies are so divergent that they deserve the species status. Controlling for geographic and time distances that separate these samples, which have a significant effect, we found that G. p. gambiensis from different landscapes (Niayes of Senegal, savannah and coastal environments) were significantly genetically different and thus represent different ecotypes or subspecies. We also confirm that G. p. palpalis from Ivory Coast, Cameroon and DRC are strongly divergent. Conclusions/Significance These results provide an opportunity to examine whether new tsetse fly ecotypes might display different behaviour, dispersal patterns, host preferences and vectorial capacities. This work also urges a revision of taxonomic status of Glossina palpalis subspecies and highlights again how fast ecological divergence can be, especially in host-parasite-vector systems.","[De Meeus, Thierry; Solano, Philippe] CIRDES, IRD CIRAD, UMR 177, IRD INTERTRYP, Bobo Dioulasso, Burkina Faso; [De Meeus, Thierry; Bouyer, Jeremy; Ravel, Sophie; Solano, Philippe] IRD CIRAD, UMR177, IRD INTERTRYP, Montpellier, France; [Bouyer, Jeremy] Ctr Cooperat Int Rech Agronom Dev CIRAD, Rech Contr Malad Anim Exot & Emergentes, Montpellier, France; [Bouyer, Jeremy] INRA, Unite Mixte Rech 1309, Controle Malad Anim Exot & Emergentes, F-34060 Montpellier, France; [Bouyer, Jeremy] Inst Senegalais Rech Agricoles, Lab Natl Elevage & Rech Vet, Dakar, Hann, Senegal","De Meeus, T (reprint author), CIRDES, IRD CIRAD, UMR 177, IRD INTERTRYP, Bobo Dioulasso, Burkina Faso.",thierry.demeeus@ird.fr,"solano, philippe/B-2328-2010","solano, philippe/0000-0002-4351-3506",,,,60,5,5,0,7,PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE,SAN FRANCISCO,"1160 BATTERY STREET, STE 100, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94111 USA",1935-2735,,,PLOS NEGLECT TROP D,Plos Neglect.

Previous research in the southern part of Lao People's Democratic Republic (Lao PDR) revealed high prevalence rates of hookworm infection. The purpose of this study was to predict the spatial distribution of hookworm infection and intensity, and to investigate risk factors in the Champasack province, southern Lao PDR. Methodology A cross-sectional parasitological and questionnaire survey was conducted in 51 villages. Data on demography, socioeconomic status, water, sanitation, and behavior were combined with remotely sensed environmental data. Bayesian mixed effects logistic and negative binomial models were utilized to investigate risk factors and spatial distribution of hookworm infection and intensity, and to make predictions for non-surveyed locations. Principal Findings A total of 3,371 individuals were examined with duplicate Kato-Katz thick smears and revealed a hookworm prevalence of 48.8%. Most infections (91.7%) were of light intensity (11,999 eggs/g of stool). Lower hookworm infection levels were associated with higher socioeconomic status. The lowest infection levels were found in preschool-aged children. Overall, females were at lower risk of infection, but women aged 50 years and above harbored the heaviest hookworm infection intensities. Hookworm was widespread in Champasack province with little evidence for spatial clustering. Infection risk was somewhat lower in the lowlands, mostly along the western bank of the Mekong River, while infection intensity was homogeneous across the Champasack province. Conclusions/Significance Hookworm transmission seems to occur within, rather than between villages in Champasack province. We present spatial risk maps of hookworm infection and intensity, which suggest that control efforts should be intensified in the Champasack province, particularly in mountainous areas.","[Forrer, Armelle; Vounatsou, Penelope; Sayasone, Somphou; Vonghachack, Youthanavanh; Utzinger, Juerg; Odermatt, Peter] Swiss Trop & Publ Hlth Inst, Dept Epidemiol & Publ Hlth, Basel, Switzerland; [Forrer, Armelle; Vounatsou, Penelope; Sayasone, Somphou; Vonghachack, Youthanavanh; Utzinger, Juerg; Odermatt, Peter] Univ Basel, Basel, Switzerland; [Sayasone, Somphou; Akkhavong, Kongsap] Minist Hlth, Natl Inst Publ Hlth, Viangchan, Laos; [Vonghachack, Youthanavanh; Bouakhasith, Dalouny] Univ Hlth Sci, Fac Basic Sci, Viangchan, Laos","Forrer, A (reprint author), Swiss Trop & Publ Hlth Inst, Dept Epidemiol & Publ Hlth, Basel, Switzerland.",peter.odermatt@unibas.ch,"Odermatt, Peter/K-7727-2015","Odermatt, Peter/0000-0002-0296-2508; Vounatsou, Penelope/0000-0002-4904-5352",Swiss National Science Foundation; Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation [NF3270B0-110020],"This investigation was funded by the Swiss National Science Foundation and the Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation (project no.

As a result, implementing sustainable infectious disease surveillance systems in these regions is challenging. The cost of these programs and difficulties associated with collecting, storing and transporting relevant samples have hindered them in the regions where they are most needed. Therefore, we tested the sensitivity and feasibility of a novel surveillance technique called xenosurveillance. This approach utilizes the host feeding preferences and behaviors of Anopheles gambiae, which are highly anthropophilic and rest indoors after feeding, to sample viruses in human beings. We hypothesized that mosquito bloodmeals could be used to detect vertebrate viral pathogens within realistic field collection timeframes and clinically relevant concentrations. Methodology/Principal Findings To validate this approach, we examined variables influencing virus detection such as the duration between mosquito blood feeding and mosquito processing, the pathogen nucleic acid stability in the mosquito gut and the pathogen load present in the host's blood at the time of bloodmeal ingestion using our laboratory model. Our findings revealed that viral nucleic acids, at clinically relevant concentrations, could be detected from engorged mosquitoes for up to 24 hours post feeding by qRT-PCR. Subsequently, we tested this approach in the field by examining blood from engorged mosquitoes from two field sites in Liberia. Using next-generation sequencing and PCR we were able to detect the genetic signatures of multiple viral pathogens including Epstein-Barr virus and canine distemper virus. Conclusions/Significance Together, these data demonstrate the feasibility of xenosurveillance and in doing so validated a simple and non-invasive surveillance tool that could be used to complement current biosurveillance efforts.","[Grubaugh, Nathan D.; Krajacich, Benjamin J.; Ebel, Gregory D.; Foy, Brian D.; Brackney, Doug E.] Colorado State Univ, Dept Microbiol Immunol & Pathol, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA; [Sharma, Supriya; Johnson, W.

Due to the intensive use of praziquantel, there is increasing concern about the development of drug-resistant strains. Therefore, it is necessary to search for and investigate new potential schistosomicidal compounds. This work reports the in vivo effect of the alkaloid epiisopiloturine (EPI) against adults and juvenile worms of Schistosoma mansoni. EPI was first purified its thermal behavior and theoretical solubility parameters charaterised. In the experiment, mice were treated with EPI over the 21 days post-infection with the doses of 40 and 200 mg/kg, and 45 days post-infection with single doses of 40, 100 and 300 mg/kg. The treatment with EPI at 40 mg/kg was more effective in adult worms when compared with doses of 100 and 300 mg/kg. The treatment with 40 mg/kg in adult worms reduced parasite burden significantly, lead to reduction in hepatosplenomegaly, reduced the egg burden in faeces, and decreased granuloma diameter. Scanning electron microscopy revealed morphological changes to the parasite tegument after treatment, including the loss of important features. Additionally, the in vivo treatment against juvenile with 40 mg/kg showed a reduction of the total worm burden of 50.2%. Histopathological studies were performed on liver, spleen, lung, kidney and brain and EPI was shown to have a DL50 of 8000 mg/kg. Therefore EPI shows potential to be used in schistosomiasis treatment. This is the first time that schistosomicidal in vivo activity of EPI has been reported.","[Guimaraes, Maria A.; Veras, Leiz M.

Recently, the rapid increase of scrub typhus incidence in several countries within the endemic region has become a serious public health issue. Despite the wide range of preventative approaches that have been attempted in the past 70 years, all have failed to develop an effective prophylactic vaccine. Currently, the selection of the proper antigens is one of the critical barriers to generating cross-protective immunity against antigenically-variable strains of O. tsutsugamushi. Methodology/Principal Findings We examined the potential role of ScaA protein, an autotransporter protein of O. tsutsugamushi, in bacterial pathogenesis and evaluated the protective attributes of ScaA immunization in lethal O. tsutsugamushi infection in mice. Our findings demonstrate that ScaA functions as a bacterial adhesion factor, and anti-ScaA antibody significantly neutralizes bacterial infection of host cells. In addition, immunization with ScaA not only provides protective immunity against lethal challenges with the homologous strain, but also confers significant protection against heterologous strains when combined with TSA56, a major outer membrane protein of O. tsutsugamushi. Conclusions/Significance Immunization of ScaA proteins provides protective immunity in mice when challenged with the homologous strain and significantly enhanced protective immunity against infection with heterologous strains. To our knowledge, this is the most promising result of scrub typhus vaccination trials against infection of heterologous strains in mouse models thus far.","[Ha, Na-Young; Sharma, Prashant; Kim, Gwanghun; Kim, Yuri; Min, Chan-Ki; Choi, Myung-Sik; Kim, Ik-Sang; Cho, Nam-Hyuk] Seoul Natl Univ, Coll Med, Dept Microbiol & Immunol, Seoul, South Korea; [Ha, Na-Young; Sharma, Prashant; Kim, Gwanghun; Kim, Yuri; Min, Chan-Ki; Cho, Nam-Hyuk] Seoul Natl Univ, Coll Med, Dept Biomed Sci, Seoul, South Korea; [Cho, Nam-Hyuk] Seoul Natl Univ, Med Res Ctr, Inst Endem Dis, Seoul, South Korea; [Cho, Nam-Hyuk] Bundang Hosp, Seoul, South Korea","Ha, NY (reprint author), Seoul Natl Univ, Coll Med, Dept Microbiol & Immunol, Seoul, South Korea.",chonh@snu.ac.kr,"Sharma, Prashant/I-1840-2019","sharma, prashant/0000-0001-9353-9520","Korea Healthcare Technology RD Project; Ministry for Health, Welfare Family Affairs [A111503]; National Research Foundation of Korea [NRF-2013R1A2A2A01007299]","This study was supported by grants from the Korea Healthcare Technology R&D Project, Ministry for Health, Welfare & Family Affairs (A111503) and by the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF-2013R1A2A2A01007299).

We aimed to describe the clinical characteristics of leishmaniasis patients and the changes in the disease evolution after the introduction of antiretroviral therapy in 1997. In this descriptive study, we used Spanish Centralized Hospital Discharge Database for the hospitalized leishmaniasis cases between 1997 and 2011. We included in the analysis only the records having leishmaniasis as the first registered diagnosis and calculated the hospitalization rates. Disease trend was described taking into account the HIV status. Adjusted odds-ratio was used to estimate the association between clinical and socio-demographic factors and HIV co-infection. Of the total 8010 Leishmaniasis hospitalizations records, 3442 had leishmaniasis as first diagnosis; 2545/3442 (75.6%) were males and 2240/3442 (65.1%) aged between 14-65 years. Regarding disease forms, 2844/3442 (82.6%) of hospitalizations were due to visceral leishmaniasis (VL), while 118/3442 (3.4%) hospitalizations were cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL). Overall, 1737/2844 of VL (61.1%) were HIV negatives. An overall increasing trend was observed for the records with leishmaniasis as first diagnosis (p=0.113). Non-HIV leishmaniasis increased during this time period (p=0.021) while leishmaniasis-HIV co-infection hospitalization revealed a slight descending trend (p=0.717). Leishmaniasis-HIV co-infection was significantly associated with male sex (aOR=1.6; 95% CI: 1.25-2.04), 16-64 years age group (aOR=17.4; 95% CI: 2.1-143.3), visceral leishmaniasis aOR=6.1 (95% CI: 3.27-11.28) and solid neoplasms 4.5 (95% CI: 1.65-12.04). The absence of HIV co-infection was associated with lymph/hematopoietic neoplasms (aOR=0.3; 95% CI: 0.14-0.57), other immunodeficiency (aOR=0.04; 95% CI: 0.01-0.32) and transplant (aOR=0.01; 95% CI: 0.00-0.07). Our findings suggest a significant increase of hospitalization in the absence of HIV co-infection, with a predomination of VL. We consider that clinicians in Spain should be aware of leishmaniasis not only in the HIV population but also in non HIV patients, especially for those having immunosuppression as an associate condition.","[Herrador, Zaida; Gherasim, Alin; Aparicio, Pilar] Hlth Inst Carlos III ISCIII Spanish, Natl Ctr Trop Med, Madrid, Spain; [Herrador, Zaida; Victor San Martin, Juan] Network Biomed Res Trop Dis RICET Spanish, Madrid, Spain; [Carolina Jimenez, B.] Med Sans Frontieres, Madrid, Spain; [Granados, Marisol] Univ Hosp Rio Ortega, Dept Prevent Med, Valladolid, Spain; [Victor San Martin, Juan] Univ Hosp Fuenlabrada, Dept Internal Med, Madrid, Spain","Herrador, Z (reprint author), Hlth Inst Carlos III ISCIII Spanish, Natl Ctr Trop Med, Madrid, Spain.",zherrador@isciii.es,,"Herrador, Zaida/0000-0002-6508-3818; San Martin, Juan Victor/0000-0003-4457-5124",,,,28,19,19,1,8,PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE,SAN FRANCISCO,"1160 BATTERY STREET, STE 100, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94111 USA",1935-2735,,,PLOS NEGLECT TROP D,Plos Neglect.

Presentation of human RVF varies from mild febrile illness to meningoencephalitis, hemorrhagic diathesis, and/or ophthalmitis with residual retinal scarring, but the determinants for severe disease are not understood. The aim of the present study was to identify human genes associated with RVF clinical disease in a high-risk population in Northeastern Province, Kenya. Methodology/Principal Findings We conducted a cross-sectional survey among residents (N = 1,080; 1-85 yrs) in 6 villages in the Sangailu Division of Ijara District. Participants completed questionnaires on past symptoms and exposures, physical exam, vision testing, and blood collection. Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotyping was performed on a subset of individuals who reported past clinical symptoms consistent with RVF and unrelated subjects. Four symptom clusters were defined: meningoencephalitis, hemorrhagic fever, eye disease, and RVF-not otherwise specified. SNPs in 46 viral sensing and response genes were investigated. Association was analyzed between SNP genotype, serology and RVF symptom clusters. The meningoencephalitis symptom phenotype cluster among seropositive patients was associated with polymorphisms in DDX58/RIG-I and TLR8. Having three or more RVF-related symptoms was significantly associated with polymorphisms in TICAM1/TRIF, MAVS, IFNAR1 and DDX58/RIG-I. SNPs significantly associated with eye disease included three different polymorphisms TLR8 and hemorrhagic fever symptoms associated with TLR3, TLR7, TLR8 and MyD88. Conclusions/Significance Of the 46 SNPs tested, TLR3, TLR7, TLR8, MyD88, TRIF, MAVS, and RIG-I were repeatedly associated with severe symptomatology, suggesting that these genes may have a robust association with RVFV-associated clinical outcomes. Studies of these and related genetic polymorphisms are warranted to advance understanding of RVF pathogenesis.","[Hise, Amy G.; Traylor, Zachary; Sutherland, Laura J.; Ermler, Megan E.; Kazura, James W.; King, Charles H.] Case Western Reserve Univ, Sch Med, Ctr Global Hlth & Dis, Cleveland, OH 44106 USA; [Hise, Amy G.; Ermler, Megan E.] Case Western Reserve Univ, Sch Med, Dept Pathol, Cleveland, OH USA; [Hise, Amy G.] Vet Affairs Med Ctr, Louis Stokes Cleveland Dept, Res Serv, Cleveland, OH USA; [Stein, Catherine M.] Case Western Reserve Univ, Dept Epidemiol & Biostat, Cleveland, OH 44106 USA; [Hall, Noemi B.; Dahir, Saidi; Muiruri, Samuel; Muchiri, Eric M.] Minist Publ Hlth & Sanitat, Div Vector Borne & Neglected Trop Dis, Nairobi, Kenya; [LaBeaud, A.

Spatial dynamics of the fatal zoonotic disease rabies among countries of the Middle East and surrounding regions is poorly understood. An improved understanding of virus distribution is necessary to direct control methods. Previous studies have suggested regular trans-boundary movement, but have been unable to infer direction. Here we address these issues, by investigating the evolution of 183 rabies virus isolates collected from over 20 countries between 1972 and 2014. We have undertaken a discrete phylogeographic analysis on a subset of 139 samples to infer where and when movements of rabies have occurred. We provide evidence for four genetically distinct clades with separate origins currently circulating in the Middle East and surrounding countries. Introductions of these viruses have been followed by regular and multidirectional trans-boundary movements in some parts of the region, but relative isolation in others. There is evidence for minimal regular incursion of rabies from Central and Eastern Asia. These data support current initiatives for regional collaboration that are essential for rabies elimination.","[Horton, Daniel L.; McElhinney, Lorraine M.; Marston, Denise A.; Banyard, Ashley C.; Goharrriz, Hooman; Wise, Emma; Breed, Andrew C.; Fooks, Anthony R.] Anim & Plant Hlth Agcy, Addlestone, Surrey, England; [Horton, Daniel L.] Univ Surrey, Sch Vet Med, Guildford GU2 5XH, Surrey, England; [McElhinney, Lorraine M.; Fooks, Anthony R.] Univ Liverpool, Inst Infect & Global Hlth, Liverpool L69 3BX, Merseyside, England; [Freuling, Conrad M.; Mueller, Thomas] Friedrich Loeffler Inst, Inst Mol Virol & Cell Biol, Greifswald, Germany; [Saturday, Greg] NIAID, Rocky Mt Labs, NIH, Hamilton, MT 59840 USA; [Saturday, Greg] USAPHCR Europe Lab Sci, Vet Pathol, Landstuhl, Germany; [Kolodziejek, Jolanta; Nowotny, Norbert] Univ Vet Med Vienna, Inst Virol, Vienna, Austria; [Zilahi, Erika] United Arab Emirates Univ, Dept Med Microbiol & Immunol, Coll Med & Hlth Sci, Al Ain, U Arab Emirates; [Al-Kobaisi, Muhannad F.; Nowotny, Norbert] Sultan Qaboos Univ, Dept Microbiol & Immunol, Coll Med & Hlth Sci, Muscat, Oman","Fooks, AR (reprint author), Anim & Plant Hlth Agcy, Addlestone, Surrey, England.",Tony.Fooks@apha.gsi.gov.uk,"Breed, Andrew/A-5682-2011; Marston, Denise/D-7993-2011; Banyard, Ashley/C-7998-2011; Horton, Daniel/D-9909-2011; Fooks, Anthony R/F-5418-2010; Nowotny, Norbert/A-5474-2019; Wise, Emma/D-7998-2011","Breed, Andrew/0000-0002-3439-9510; Marston, Denise/0000-0001-9215-088X; Banyard, Ashley/0000-0002-1286-9825; Horton, Daniel/0000-0002-9126-2756; Nowotny, Norbert/0000-0002-3548-571X; Wise, Emma/0000-0002-0279-3900",UK Department for Environment and Rural Affairs (Defra ROAME) [SE0427]; UK Biological Engagement Program; EU [228292]; BMBF [01KI1016A]; United Arab Emirates University - Sultan Qaboos University Research,"This work was partially supported by the UK Department for Environment and Rural Affairs (Defra ROAME SE0427), the UK Biological Engagement Program, the EU FP7-funded Research Infrastructure Grant 'European Virus Archive (EVA)' (grant number 228292), BMBF grant 01KI1016A ""Lyssaviruses - a potential re-emerging public health threat"" and by a joint United Arab Emirates University - Sultan Qaboos University Research grant entitled ""Molecular characterization of selected zoonotic and emerging viruses isolated in the U.A.E. and in Oman.

To determine the exposure factors and range of symptoms associated with human RVF, we performed a population-based cross-sectional survey in six villages across a 40 km transect in northeastern Kenya. Methodology/Principal Findings: Methodology/Principal Findings: A systematic survey of the total populations of six North-eastern Kenyan villages was performed. Among 1082 residents tested via anti-RVFV IgG ELISA, seroprevalence was 15% (CI95%, 13-17%). Prevalence did not vary significantly among villages. Subject age was a significant factor, with 31% (154/498) of adults seropositive vs. only 2% of children <= 15 years (12/583). Seroprevalence was higher among men (18%) than women (13%). Factors associated with seropositivity included a history of animal exposure, non-focal fever symptoms, symptoms related to meningoencephalitis, and eye symptoms. Using cluster analysis in RVFV positive participants, a more severe symptom phenotype was empirically defined as having somatic symptoms of acute fever plus eye symptoms, and possibly one or more meningoencephalitic or hemorrhagic symptoms. Associated with this more severe disease phenotype were older age, village, recent illness, and loss of a family member during the last outbreak. In multivariate analysis, sheltering livestock (aOR = 3.5 CI95% 0.93-13.61, P = 0.065), disposing of livestock abortus (aOR = 4.11, CI95% 0.63-26.79, P = 0.14), and village location (P = 0.009) were independently associated with the severe disease phenotype. Conclusions/Significance Our results demonstrate that a significant proportion of the population in northeastern Kenya has been infected with RVFV. Village and certain animal husbandry activities were associated with more severe disease. Older age, male gender, herder occupation, killing and butchering livestock, and poor visual acuity were useful markers for increased RVFV infection. Formal vision testing may therefore prove to be a helpful, low-technology tool for RVF screening during epidemics in high-risk rural settings.","[LaBeaud, A.

A national web-based Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NDSS) has been in operation since 1997 to monitor incidence and trends and support case and outbreak management. We present the findings of an evaluation of the NDSS to ascertain the extent to which dengue fever surveillance objectives are being achieved. Methodology We extracted the NDSS data on all laboratory-confirmed dengue fever cases reported during 1 January 2010 to 31 December 2012 to assess and describe key system attributes based on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention surveillance evaluation guidelines. The system's structure and processes were delineated and operational staff interviewed using a semi-structured questionnaire. Crude and age-adjusted incidence rates were calculated and key demographic variables were summarised to describe reporting activity. Data completeness and validity were described across several variables. Principal Findings Of 5,072 laboratory-confirmed dengue fever cases reported during 2010-2012, 4,740 (93%) were reported during July to December. The system was judged to be simple due to its minimal reporting steps. Data collected on key variables were correctly formatted and usable in > 90% of cases, demonstrating good data completeness and validity. The information collected was considered relevant by users with high acceptability. Adherence to guidelines for 24-hour reporting was 99%. Of 720 cases (14%) recorded as travel-related, 111 (15%) had an onset > 14 days after return, highlighting the potential for misclassification. Information on hospitalization was missing for 22% of cases. The calculated PVP was 43%. Conclusions/Significance The NDSS for dengue fever surveillance is a robust, well maintained and acceptable system that supports the collection of complete and valid data needed to achieve the surveillance objectives. The simplicity of the system engenders compliance leading to timely and accurate reporting. Completeness of hospitalization information could be further improved to allow assessment of severity of illness. To minimize misclassification, an algorithm to accurately classify travel cases should be established.","[McKerr, Caoimhe; Bracebridge, Sam] Publ Hlth England, Field Epidemiol Training Programme, London, England; [McKerr, Caoimhe; Edeghere, Obaghe] Publ Hlth England, Field Epidemiol Serv, London, England; [Lo, Yi-Chun] Ctr Dis Control, Off Prevent Med, Taipei, Taiwan","McKerr, C (reprint author), Publ Hlth England, Field Epidemiol Training Programme, London, England.",loyichun@cdc.gov.tw,"Edeghere, Obaghe/G-6794-2017","Edeghere, Obaghe/0000-0002-4275-6338",,,,26,9,9,0,12,PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE,SAN FRANCISCO,"1160 BATTERY STREET, STE 100, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94111 USA",1935-2735,,,PLOS NEGLECT TROP D,Plos Neglect.

The importance of these cells has recently been demonstrated in experimental models of parasitic diseases but there is a paucity of data on ILC2s in the context of human parasitic infections and in particular of the blood dwelling parasite Schistosoma haematobium. Methodology/Principal Findings In this case-control study human peripheral blood ILC2s were analysed in relation to infection with the helminth parasite Schistosoma haematobium. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells of 36 S. haematobium infected and 36 age and sex matched uninfected children were analysed for frequencies of ILC2s identified as Lin-CD45+ CD127+ CD294+ CD161+. ILC2s were significantly lower particularly in infected children aged 6-9 years compared to healthy participants. Curative anti-helminthic treatment resulted in an increase in levels of the activating factor TSLP and restoration of ILC2 levels. Conclusion This study demonstrates that ILC2s are diminished in young helminth infected children and restored by removal of the parasites by treatment, indicating a previously undescribed association between a human parasitic infection and ILC2s and suggesting a role of ILC2s before the establishment of protective acquired immunity in human schistosomiasis.","[Nausch, Norman; Appleby, Laura J.; Sparks, Alexandra M.; Mutapi, Francisca] Univ Edinburgh, Ashworth Labs, Sch Biol Sci, Inst Immunol & Infect Res,Ctr Immun Infect & Evol, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland; [Midzi, Nicholas] Natl Inst Hlth Res, Harare, Zimbabwe; [Mduluza, Takafira] Univ Zimbabwe, Dept Biochem, Harare, Zimbabwe","Nausch, N (reprint author), Univ Childrens Hosp, Dept Gen Pediat Neonatol & Pediat Cardiol, Pediat Peneumol & Infect Dis Grp, Dusseldorf, Germany.",Norman.Nausch@med.uni-duesseldorf.de,"Nausch, Norman/M-4526-2019; Nausch, Norman/L-9276-2013","Nausch, Norman/0000-0002-9704-2148; Nausch, Norman/0000-0002-9704-2148; Sparks, Alexandra/0000-0002-7697-4632; Mutapi, Francisca/0000-0002-2537-3466",Wellcome Trust [WT082028MA]; Thrasher Research Fund,"This work was supported by the Wellcome Trust (Grant no WT082028MA; http://www.wellcome.ac.uk) and FM is funded by the Thrasher Research Fund (www.thrasherresearch.org).

We previously identified antagonists of the AaDOP2 D1-like dopamine receptor (DAR) from the yellow fever mosquito, Aedes aegypti, with toxicity to Ae. aegypti larvae as leads for novel insecticides. To extend DAR-based insecticide discovery, we evaluated the molecular and pharmacological characteristics of an orthologous DAR target, CqDOP2, from Culex quinquefasciatus, the vector of lymphatic filariasis and West Nile virus. Methods/Results CqDOP2 has 94.7% amino acid identity to AaDOP2 and 28.3% identity to the human D1-like DAR, hD1. CqDOP2 and AaDOP2 exhibited similar pharmacological responses to biogenic amines and DAR antagonists in cell-based assays. The antagonists amitriptyline, amperozide, asenapine, chlorpromazine and doxepin were between 35 to 227-fold more selective at inhibiting the response of CqDOP2 and AaDOP2 in comparison to hD1. Antagonists were toxic to both C. quinquefasciatus and Ae. aegypti larvae, with LC50 values ranging from 41 to 208 mu M 72 h post-exposure. Orthologous DOP2 receptors identified from the African malaria mosquito, Anopheles gambiae, the sand fly, Phlebotomus papatasi and the tsetse fly, Glossina morsitans, had high sequence similarity to CqDOP2 and AaDOP2. Conclusions DAR antagonists represent a putative new insecticide class with activity against C. quinquefasciatus and Ae. aegypti, the two most important mosquito vectors of NTDs. There has been limited change in the sequence and pharmacological properties of the DOP2 DARs of these species since divergence of the tribes Culicini and Aedini. We identified antagonists selective for mosquito versus human DARs and observed a correlation between DAR pharmacology and the in vivo larval toxicity of antagonists. These data demonstrate that sequence similarity can be predictive of target potential. On this basis, we propose expanded insecticide discovery around orthologous DOP2 targets from additional dipteran vectors.","[Nuss, Andrew B.; Meyer, Jason M.; Lang, Emma G.; Hill, Catherine A.] Purdue Univ, Dept Entomol, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA; [Ejendal, Karin F.

There is a WHO-recommended antibiotic treatment requiring an 8-week course of streptomycin and rifampicin. This regime has revolutionized the treatment of BU but there are problems that include reliance on daily streptomycin injections and side effects such as ototoxicity. Trials of all-oral treatments for BU show promise but additional drug combinations that make BU treatment safer and shorter would be welcome. Following on from reports that avermectins have activity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis, we tested the in-vitro efficacy of ivermectin and moxidectin on M. ulcerans. We observed minimum inhibitory concentrations of 4-8 mu g/ml and time-kill assays using wild type and bioluminescent M. ulcerans showed a significant dose-dependent reduction in M. ulcerans viability over 8-weeks. A synergistic killing-effect with rifampicin was also observed. Avermectins are well tolerated, widely available and inexpensive. Based on our in vitro findings we suggest that avermectins should be further evaluated for the treatment of BU.","[Omansen, Till F.; Porter, Jessica L.; Johnson, Paul D.

The renal response to persistent leptospiral colonization, as measured by urinary protein biosignatures, has not been systematically studied. Urinary exosomes-bioactive membrane-bound nanovesicles-contain cell-state specific cargo that additively reflect formation all along the nephron. We hypothesized that Leptospira-infection will alter the content of urine exosomes, and further, that these Leptospira-induced alterations will hold clues to unravel novel pathways related to bacterial-host interactions. Methodology/Principal findings Exosome protein content from 24 hour urine samples of Leptospira-infected rats was compared with that of uninfected rats using SDS-PAGE and liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Statistical models were used to identify significantly dysregulated proteins in Leptospira-infected and uninfected rat urine exosomes. In all, 842 proteins were identified by LC-MS/MS proteomics of total rat urine and 204 proteins associated specifically with exosomes. Multivariate analysis showed that 25 proteins significantly discriminated between uninfected control and infected rats. Alanyl (membrane) aminopeptidase, also known as CD13 topped this list with the highest score, a finding we validated by Western immunoblotting. Whole urine analysis showed Tamm-Horsfall protein level reduction in the infected rat urine. Total urine and exosome proteins were significantly different in male vs. female infected rats. Conclusions We identified exosome-associated renal tubule-specific responses to Leptospira infection in a rat chronic colonizationmodel. Quantitative differences in infected male and female rat urine exosome proteins vs. uninfected controls suggest that urine exosome analysis identifies important differences in kidney function that may be of clinical and pathological significance.","[RamachandraRao, Satish P.; Mondrogon, Chanthel-Kokoy; Aghania, Eamon; Park, Cathleen; Kong, Casey; Ishaya, Michelle; Madrigal, Assael; Horng, Jennifer; Khoshaba, Roni; Bounkhoun, Anousone; Awdishu, Linda] Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Med, Div Nephrol Hypertens, San Diego, CA 92103 USA; [RamachandraRao, Satish P.] Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Pediat, Ctr Promot Maternal Hlth & Infant Dev, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Matthias, Michael A.; Vinetz, Joseph M.] Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Med, Div Infect Dis, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Basilico, Fabrizio; De Palma, Antonella; Agresta, Anna Maria; Mauri, Pierluigi] CNR, ITB, Prote & Metabol Lab, Segrate, MI, Italy; [Naviaux, Robert K.] Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Med, San Diego, CA 92103 USA; [Naviaux, Robert K.] Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Pediat, San Diego, CA 92103 USA; [Naviaux, Robert K.] Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Pathol, San Diego, CA 92103 USA; [Mauri, Pierluigi] Scuola Super Sant Anna, Inst Life Sci, Pisa, Italy","RamachandraRao, SP (reprint author), Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Med, Div Nephrol Hypertens, San Diego, CA 92103 USA.",satishrao@ucsd.edu; jvinetz@ucsd.edu,"De Palma, Antonella/K-8451-2016; Agresta, Anna Maria/Q-5650-2018","De Palma, Antonella/0000-0001-5937-8604; Agresta, Anna Maria/0000-0002-1173-3205; Aghania, Eamon/0000-0002-7874-4064; Awdishu, Linda/0000-0002-3187-3264","NIH [R01AI108276, K24AI068903, NIH 1P30 DK 079337]; GSK-SSS; UC San Diego CRCHD [NIH/NIMHD-P60 MD000220]; UC San Diego Academic Senate Health Sciences Research Grant; CNR-Regione Lombardia for project G-care [18094/RCC, 17242]; Italian MIUR for Smart Aging project [SCN00_442]","This work was supported by NIH grants R01AI108276 and K24AI068903.

Despite the apparent burden of disease in many countries, there have been few large-scale surveys of scabies prevalence or risk factors. We undertook a population-based survey in Fiji of scabies and impetigo to evaluate the magnitude of the problem and inform public health strategies. Methodology/Principal Findings A total of 75 communities, including villages and settlements in both urban and rural areas, were randomly selected from 305 communities across the four administrative divisions, and all residents in each location were invited to participate in skin examination by trained personnel. The study enrolled 10,887 participants. The prevalence of scabies was 23.6%, and when adjusted for age structure and geographic location based on census data, the estimated national prevalence was 18.5%. The prevalence was highest in children aged five to nine years (43.7%), followed by children aged less than five (36.5%), and there was also an indication of prevalence increasing again in older age. The prevalence of scabies was twice as high in iTaukei (indigenous) Fijians compared to Indo-Fijians. The prevalence of impetigo was 19.6%, with a peak in children aged five to nine years (34.2%). Scabies was very strongly associated with impetigo, with an estimated 93% population attributable risk. Conclusions As far as we are aware, this is the first national survey of scabies and impetigo ever conducted. We found that scabies occurs at high levels across all age groups, ethnicities, and geographical locations. Improved strategies are urgently needed to achieve control of scabies and its complications in endemic communities.","[Romani, Lucia; Kaldor, John M.; Wand, Handan] Univ New S Wales, Kirby Inst, Sydney, NSW 2036, Australia; [Koroivueta, Josefa] Minist Social Welf, Suva, Fiji; [Steer, Andrew C.] Univ Melbourne, Ctr Int Child Hlth, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia; [Kama, Mike] Minist Hlth, Suva, Fiji; [Hamid, Mohammed] Mugda 500 Bed Gen Hosp, Dhaka, Bangladesh; [Whitfeld, Margot J.] St Vincents Hosp, Dept Dermatol, Sydney, NSW 2010, Australia","Romani, L (reprint author), Univ New S Wales, Kirby Inst, Sydney, NSW 2036, Australia.",lromani@kirby.unsw.edu.au,,"Romani, Lucia/0000-0001-9038-5300",,,,25,40,40,0,5,PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE,SAN FRANCISCO,"1160 BATTERY STREET, STE 100, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94111 USA",1935-2735,,,PLOS NEGLECT TROP D,Plos Neglect.

Our objective was to identify the main ecological and sociodemographic determinants of house infestation and abundance of Triatoma infestans in traditional Qom populations including a Creole minority in Pampa del Indio, northeastern Argentina. Methods A cross-sectional survey determined house infestation by timed-manual searches with a dislodging aerosol in 386 inhabited houses and administered questionnaires on selected variables before full-coverage insecticide spraying and annual vector surveillance. We fitted generalized linear models to two global models of domestic infestation and bug abundance, and estimated coefficients via multimodel inference with model averaging. Principal Findings Most Qom households were larger and lived in small-sized, recently-built, precarious houses with fewer peridomestic structures, and fewer livestock and poultry than Creoles'. Qom households had lower educational level and unexpectedly high residential mobility. House infestation (31.9%) was much lower than expected from lack of recent insecticide spraying campaigns and was spatially aggregated. Nearly half of the infested houses examined had infected vectors. Qom households had higher prevalence of domestic infestation (29.2%) than Creoles' (10.0%), although there is large uncertainty around the adjusted OR. Factors with high relative importance for domestic infestation and/or bug abundance were refuge availability, distance to the nearest infested house, domestic insecticide use, indoor presence of poultry, residential overcrowding, and household educational level. Conclusions and Significance Our study highlights the importance of sociodemographic determinants of domestic infestation such as overcrowding, education and proximity to the nearest infested house, and corroborates the role of refuge availability, domestic use of insecticides and household size. These factors may be used for designing improved interventions for sustainable disease control and risk stratification. Housing instability, household mobility and migration patterns are key to understanding the process of house (re) infestation in the Gran Chaco.","[Sol Gaspe, M.; Provecho, Yael M.; Victoria Cardinal, M.; del Pilar Fernandez, M.; Guertler, Ricardo E.] Univ Buenos Aires IEGEBA CONICET UBA, Dept Ecol Genet & Evolut, Lab Ecoepidemiol, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina","Guertler, RE (reprint author), Univ Buenos Aires IEGEBA CONICET UBA, Dept Ecol Genet & Evolut, Lab Ecoepidemiol, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina.",gurtler@ege.fcen.uba.ar,,"Fernandez, Maria/0000-0001-8645-2267","Tropical Disease Research (UNICEF/PNUD/WB/WHO) [A70596]; Agencia Nacional de Promocion Cientifica y Tecnologica [PICT 2011-2072, PICTO-Glaxo 2011-0062]; University of Buenos Aires [20020100100-944]","This study was supported by awards from Tropical Disease Research (UNICEF/PNUD/WB/WHO)(No. A70596; http://www.who.int/tdr), Agencia Nacional de Promocion Cientifica y Tecnologica (PICT 2011-2072 and PICTO-Glaxo 2011-0062; http://www.agencia.mincyt.gob.ar), and the University of Buenos Aires (20020100100-944; http://www.uba.ar) to REG.

One common feature of trypanosomosis is the occurrence of anemia, caused by an imbalance between erythropoiesis and red blood cell clearance of aging erythrocytes. In murine models for T. brucei trypanosomosis, anemia is marked by a very sudden non-hemolytic loss of RBCs during the first-peak parasitemia control, followed by a short recovery phase and the subsequent gradual occurrence of an ever-increasing level of anemia. Using a newly developed quantitative pHrodo based in vitro erythrophagocytosis assay, combined with FACS-based ex vivo and in vivo results, we show that activated liver monocytic cells and neutrophils as well as activated splenic macrophages are the main cells involved in the occurrence of the early-stage acute anemia. In addition, we show that trypanosomosis itself leads to a rapid alteration of RBC membrane stability, priming the cells for accelerated phagocytosis.","[Stijlemans, Benoit; Cnops, Jennifer; Naniima, Peter; Vaast, Axel; Bockstal, Viki; De Baetselier, Patrick; Magez, Stefan] Vrije Univ Brussel, Lab Cellular & Mol Immunol, Brussels, Belgium; [Stijlemans, Benoit; De Baetselier, Patrick] VIB, Dept Myeloid Cell Immunol, Brussels, Belgium; [Cnops, Jennifer; Naniima, Peter; Vaast, Axel; Bockstal, Viki; Magez, Stefan] VIB, Dept Biol Struct, Brussels, Belgium","Stijlemans, B (reprint author), Vrije Univ Brussel, Lab Cellular & Mol Immunol, Brussels, Belgium.",bstijlem@vub.ac.be; jcnops@vub.ac.be,"Vaast, Axel/H-2907-2013; Magez, Stefan/D-9497-2014","Magez, Stefan/0000-0003-3760-7968; Stijlemans, Benoit/0000-0003-0082-9751","Interuniversity Attraction Pole Program [PAI-IAP N.P7/41]; FWO [KaN 1515813N BS, fwoTM597]","This work, performed in the frame of an Interuniversity Attraction Pole Program (PAI-IAP N.P7/41, http://www.belspo.be/belspo/iap/index_en.stm), was supported by grants from the FWO (KaN 1515813N BS, Project fwoTM597 JC).

Despite increased vigilance and preparedness, HFRS outbreaks in 2010, 2011, and 2012 were larger than ever, with a total of 3,938 confirmed HFRS cases and 88 deaths in 2010 and 2011. Methods and Findings Data on HFRS cases and weather were collected monthly from 2005 to 2012, along with active rodent monitoring. Wavelet analyses were performed to assess the temporal relationship between HFRS incidence, rodent density and climatic factors over the study period. Results showed that HFRS cases correlated to rodent density, rainfall, and temperature with 2, 3 and 4-month lags, respectively. Using a Bayesian time-series Poisson adjusted model, we fitted the HFRS outbreaks among humans for risk assessment in Xi'an. The best models included seasonality, autocorrelation, rodent density 2 months previously, and rainfall 2 to 3 months previously. Our models well reflected the epidemic characteristics by one step ahead prediction, out-of-sample. Conclusions In addition to a strong seasonal pattern, HFRS incidence was correlated with rodent density and rainfall, indicating that they potentially drive the HFRS outbreaks. Future work should aim to determine the mechanism underlying the seasonal pattern and autocorrelation. However, this model can be useful in risk management to provide early warning of potential outbreaks of this disease.","[Tian, Huai-Yu; Huang, Shan-Qian; Xu, Bing] Beijing Normal Univ, Coll Global Change & Earth Syst Sci, State Key Lab Remote Sensing Sci, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China; [Yu, Peng-Bo; Wei, Jing; Li, Shen; Dong, Jian-Hua; Wang, Jing-Jun] Shaanxi Prov Ctr Dis Control & Prevent, Xian, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [Luis, Angela D.] Univ Montana, Dept Ecosyst & Conservat Sci, Missoula, MT 59812 USA; [Luis, Angela D.; Grenfell, Bryan] Princeton Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolut Biol, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [Luis, Angela D.; Grenfell, Bryan] NIH, Fogarty Int Ctr, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; [Bi, Peng] Univ Adelaide, Discipline Publ Hlth, Adelaide, SA, Australia; [Cazelles, Bernard] UPMC, IRD, UMI 209, UMMISCO, F-93142 Bondy, France; [Cazelles, Bernard] ENS, IBENS,UMR 8197, Ecoevolutionary Math, F-75230 Paris 05, France; [Laine, Marko] Finnish Meteorol Inst, FIN-00101 Helsinki, Finland; [Ma, Chao-Feng] Xian Ctr Dis Control & Prevent, Xian, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [Zhou, Sen; Xu, Bing] Tsinghua Univ, Ctr Earth Syst Sci, Minist Educ, Key Lab Earth Syst Modelling, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China; [Lu, Xiao-Ling; Qu, Jian-Hui] Hu Cty Ctr Dis Control & Prevent Shaanxi Prov, Xian, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [Tong, Shi-Lu] Queensland Univ Technol, Sch Publ Hlth, Brisbane, Qld 4001, Australia; [Tong, Shi-Lu] Queensland Univ Technol, Inst Hlth & Biomed Innovat, Brisbane, Qld 4001, Australia","Tian, HY (reprint author), Beijing Normal Univ, Coll Global Change & Earth Syst Sci, State Key Lab Remote Sensing Sci, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China.",jingjunwang@china.com; bingxu@tsinghua.edu.cn,"Yu, Paul B./J-7540-2019; Cazelles, Bernard/B-1572-2013; Tian, Huaiyu/G-1934-2016","Yu, Paul B./0000-0003-2145-4944; Cazelles, Bernard/0000-0002-7972-361X; Bi, Peng/0000-0002-3238-3427","Ministry of Science and Technology, China, National Research Program [2012CB955501, 2012AA12A407]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [41271099]; European Commission [282-378]; Science and Technology Directorate, Department of Homeland Security [HSHQDC-12-C-00058]; Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation; RAPIDD program of the Science and Technology Directorate, U.S. Department of Homeland Security; Fogarty International Center, NIH","This research was supported by Ministry of Science and Technology, China, National Research Program (2012CB955501, 2012AA12A407), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (41271099).

Dengue incidence and severity have dramatically increased in Mexico during the past decades. Having objective and comparable estimates of the economic burden of dengue is essential to inform health policy, increase disease awareness, and assess the impact of dengue prevention and control technologies. Methods and Findings We estimated the annual economic and disease burden of dengue in Mexico for the years 2010-2011. We merged multiple data sources, including a prospective cohort study; patient interviews and macro-costing from major hospitals; surveillance, budget, and health data from the Ministry of Health; WHO cost estimates; and available literature. We conducted a probabilistic sensitivity analysis using Monte Carlo simulations to derive 95% certainty levels (CL) for our estimates. Results suggest that Mexico had about 139,000 (95% CL: 128,000-253,000) symptomatic and 119 (95% CL: 75-171) fatal dengue episodes annually on average (2010-2011), compared to an average of 30,941 symptomatic and 59 fatal dengue episodes reported. The annual cost, including surveillance and vector control, was US $170 (95% CL: 151-292) million, or $1.56 (95% CL: 1.38-2.68) per capita, comparable to other countries in the region. Of this, $87 (95% CL: 87-209) million or $0.80 per capita (95% CL: 0.62-1.12) corresponds to illness. Annual disease burden averaged 65 (95% CL: 36-99) disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) per million population. Inclusion of long-term sequelae, co-morbidities, impact on tourism, and health system disruption during outbreaks would further increase estimated economic and disease burden. Conclusion With this study, Mexico joins Panama, Puerto Rico, Nicaragua, and Thailand as the only countries or areas worldwide with comprehensive (illness and preventive) empirical estimates of dengue burden. Burden varies annually; during an outbreak, dengue burden may be significantly higher than that of the pre-vaccine level of rotavirus diarrhea. In sum, Mexico's potential economic benefits from dengue control would be substantial.","[Undurraga, Eduardo A.; Shepard, Donald S.] Brandeis Univ, Heller Sch, Schneider Inst Hlth Policy, Waltham, MA 02254 USA; [Betancourt-Cravioto, Miguel; Tapia-Conyer, Roberto] Carlos Slim Hlth Inst, Mexico City, DF, Mexico; [Ramos-Castaneda, Jose; Martinez-Vega, Ruth] Inst Nacl Salud Publ, Cuernavaca, Morelos, Mexico; [Ramos-Castaneda, Jose] Univ Texas Med Branch, Ctr Trop Dis, Galveston, TX 77555 USA; [Martinez-Vega, Ruth] Org Latinoamer Fomento Invest Salud, Bucaramanga, Colombia; [Mendez-Galvan, Jorge] Hosp Infantil Mexico Dr Federico Gomez, Mexico City, DF, Mexico; [Gubler, Duane J.] Duke NUS Grad Med Sch, Singapore, Singapore; [Guzman, Maria G.] Pedro Kouri Trop Med Inst, Havana, Cuba; [Halstead, Scott B.] Pediat Dengue Vaccine Initiat, Rockville, MD USA; [Harris, Eva] Univ Calif Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Kuri-Morales, Pablo] Minist Hlth, Mexico City, DF, Mexico","Undurraga, EA (reprint author), Brandeis Univ, Heller Sch, Schneider Inst Hlth Policy, Waltham, MA 02254 USA.",shepard@brandeis.edu,"Ramos-Castaneda, jose/V-6678-2019; Undurraga, Eduardo/I-3739-2014","Undurraga, Eduardo/0000-0002-4425-1253; Martinez-Vega, Ruth/0000-0002-6477-334X","Sanofi Pasteur; Brandeis University; UBS Optimus Foundation through University of California, Berkeley; Carlos Slim Health Institute; Pfizer Institute for Science; Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia de Mexico, CONACyT [138511]","This study was supported in part by a research agreement between Sanofi Pasteur and Brandeis University.

In this study, we reviewed all cases of asymptomatic and symptomatic toxocariasis diagnosed during post-travel consultations at the reference travel clinic of the Institute of Tropical Medicine, Antwerp, Belgium. Toxocariasis was considered as highly probable if serum Toxocara-antibodies were detected in combination with symptoms of visceral larva migrans if present, elevated eosinophil count in blood or other relevant fluid and reasonable exclusion of alternative diagnosis, or definitive in case of documented seroconversion. From 2000 to 2013, 190 travelers showed Toxocara-antibodies, of a total of 3436 for whom the test was requested (5.5%). Toxocariasis was diagnosed in 28 cases (23 symptomatic and 5 asymptomatic) including 21 highly probable and 7 definitive. All but one patients were adults. Africa and Asia were the place of acquisition for 10 and 9 cases, respectively. Twelve patients (43%) were short-term travelers (<1 month). Symptoms, when present, developed during travel or within 8 weeks maximum after return, and included abdominal complaints (11/23 symptomatic patients, 48%), respiratory symptoms and skin abnormalities (10 each, 43%) and fever (9, 39%), often in combination. Two patients were diagnosed with transverse myelitis. At presentation, the median blood eosinophil count was 1720/mu L [ range: 510-14160] in the 21 symptomatic cases without neurological complication and 2080/mu L [range: 1100-2970] in the 5 asymptomatic individuals. All patients recovered either spontaneously or with an anti-helminthic treatment (mostly a 5-day course of albendazole), except both neurological cases who kept sequelae despite repeated treatments and prolonged corticotherapy. Toxocariasis has to be considered in travelers returning from a (sub) tropical stay with varying clinical manifestations or eosinophilia. Prognosis appears favorable with adequate treatment except in case of neurological involvement.","[Van Den Broucke, Steven; Soentjens, Patrick; Vekemans, Marc; Theunissen, Caroline; Vlieghe, Erika; Van Esbroeck, Marjan; Jacobs, Jan; Van Den Enden, Erwin; Van Den Ende, Jef; Van Gompel, Alfons; Clerinx, Jan; Bottieau, Emmanuel] Inst Trop Med, Dept Clin Sci, B-2000 Antwerp, Belgium; [Kanobana, Kirezi; Polman, Katja] Inst Trop Med, Dept Biomed Sci, B-2000 Antwerp, Belgium","Van Den Broucke, S (reprint author), Inst Trop Med, Dept Clin Sci, B-2000 Antwerp, Belgium.",ebottieau@itg.be,,,,,,33,10,10,0,0,PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE,SAN FRANCISCO,"1160 BATTERY STREET, STE 100, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94111 USA",1935-2735,,,PLOS NEGLECT TROP D,Plos Neglect.

This study aimed to quantify the association between climate variation and notified cases of HFMD in selected cities of Shanxi Province, and to provide evidence for disease control and prevention. Meteorological variables and HFMD cases data in 4 major cities (Datong, Taiyuan, Changzhi and Yuncheng) of Shanxi province, China, were obtained from the China Meteorology Administration and China CDC respectively over the period 1 January 2009 to 31 December 2013. Correlations analyses and Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA) models were used to identify and quantify the relationship between the meteorological variables and HFMD. HFMD incidence varied seasonally with the majority of cases in the 4 cities occurring from May to July. Temperatures could play important roles in the incidence of HFMD in these regions. The SARIMA models indicate that a 1 degrees C rise in average, maximum and minimum temperatures may lead to a similar relative increase in the number of cases in the 4 cities. The lag times for the effects of temperatures were identified in Taiyuan, Changzhi and Yuncheng. The numbers of cases were positively associated with average and minimum temperatures at a lag of 1 week in Taiyuan, Changzhi and Yuncheng, and with maximum temperature at a lag of 2 weeks in Yuncheng. Positive association between the temperature and HFMD has been identified from the 4 cities in Shanxi Province, although the role of weather variables on the transmission of HFMD varied in the 4 cities. Relevant prevention measures and public health action are required to reduce future risks of climate change with consideration of local climatic conditions.","[Wei, Junni] Shanxi Med Univ, Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Epidemiol, Taiyuan, Shanxi, Peoples R China; [Hansen, Alana; Bi, Peng] Univ Adelaide, Sch Populat Hlth, Discipline Publ Hlth, Adelaide, SA, Australia; [Liu, Qiyong] Chinese Ctr Dis Control & Prevent, State Key Lab Infect Dis Prevent & Control, Natl Inst Communicable Dis Control & Prevent, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Liu, Qiyong] Shandong Univ, Climate Change & Hlth Ctr, Jinan 250100, Shandong, Peoples R China; [Sun, Yehuan] Anhui Med Univ, Dept Epidemiol & Biostat, Sch Publ Hlth, Hefei, Anhui, Peoples R China; [Weinstein, Phil] Univ S Australia, Sch Pharm & Med Sci, Div Hlth Sci, Adelaide, SA 5001, Australia","Wei, JN (reprint author), Shanxi Med Univ, Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Epidemiol, Taiyuan, Shanxi, Peoples R China.",junxinni@163.com; peng.bi@adelaide.edu.au,"Ibrahim, Essam H./G-1960-2018","Ibrahim, Essam H./0000-0003-0130-2257; Bi, Peng/0000-0002-3238-3427; Weinstein, Philip/0000-0001-9860-7166",AusAID Development Research Awards Scheme [66888],"This project has been partially funded by AusAID Development Research Awards Scheme 2012 (ID 66888).

The MIA was validated using 200 human samples submitted for routine leptospirosis serology testing. The traditional microscopic agglutination (MAT) method (now 100 years old) suffers from a significant range of technical problems including a dependence on antisera which is difficult to source and produce, false positive reactions due to auto-agglutination and an inability to differentiate between IgG and IgM antibodies. A comparative validation method of the MIA against the MAT was performed and used to determine the ability of the MIA to detect leptospiral antibodies when compared with the MAT. The assay was able to determine samples in the reactive, equivocal and non-reactive ranges when compared to the MAT and was able to differentiate leptospiral IgG antibodies from leptospiral IgM antibodies. The MIA is more sensitive than the MAT and in true infections was able to detect low levels of antibody in the later stages of the acute phase as well as detect higher levels of IgM antibody earlier in the immune phase of the infection. The relatively low cost, high throughput platform and significantly reduced dependency on large volumes of rabbit antisera make this assay worthy of consideration for any microbiological assay that currently uses agglutination assays.","[Wynwood, Sarah J.; Graham, Glenn C.; Mckay, David B.; Craig, Scott B.] Univ Sunshine Coast, Fac Sci Hlth & Educ, Sippy Downs, Qld 4556, Australia; [Wynwood, Sarah J.; Burns, Mary-Anne A.; Craig, Scott B.] Queensland Hlth Forens & Sci Serv, WHO OIE FAO Collaborating Ctr Reference & Res Lep, Archerfield, Qld, Australia; [Graham, Glenn C.] Queensland Hlth Forens & Sci Serv, Chem Anal Unit, Archerfield, Qld, Australia; [Weier, Steven L.; Craig, Scott B.] Queensland Univ Technol, Sch Biomed Sci, Brisbane, Qld 4001, Australia","Wynwood, SJ (reprint author), Univ Sunshine Coast, Fac Sci Hlth & Educ, Sippy Downs, Qld 4556, Australia.",sarah.wynwood@health.qld.gov.au,"Prior, Sarah/J-2388-2019","Prior, Sarah/0000-0001-5782-9141; McKay, David/0000-0002-7956-7733","Research and Development Office, Department of Health, Queensland","This study was funded internally by the Research and Development Office, Department of Health, Queensland.

Sm29 and Sm22.6 are two parasite tegument proteins which represent promising antigens to compose a vaccine. These antigens have been associated with resistance to infection and reinfection in individuals living in endemic area for the disease and induced partial protection when evaluated in immunization trials using naive mice. Methodology/principals findings In this study we evaluated rSm29 and rSm22.6 ability to induce protection in Balb/c mice that had been previously infected with S. mansoni and further treated with Praziquantel. Our results demonstrate that three doses of the vaccine containing rSm29 were necessary to elicit significant protection (26%-48%). Immunization of mice with rSm29 induced a significant production of IL-2, IFN-gamma, IL-17, IL-4; significant production of specific antibodies; increased percentage of CD4+ central memory cells in comparison with infected and treated saline group and increased percentage of CD4+ effector memory cells in comparison with naive Balb/c mice immunized with rSm29. On the other hand, although immunization with Sm22.6 induced a robust immune response, it failed to induce protection. Conclusion/significance Our results demonstrate that rSm29 retains its ability to induce protection in previously infected animals, reinforcing its potential as a vaccine candidate.","[Alves, Clarice Carvalho; Araujo, Neusa; Fernandes dos Santos, Viviane Cristina; Couto, Flavia Bubula; Fonseca, Cristina Toscano] Fundacao Oswaldo Cruz, Ctr Pesquisas Rene Rachou, Lab Esquistossomose, Belo Horizonte, MG, Brazil; [Assis, Natan R.

Focal household transmission has been demonstrated in rural settings, but it is unclear whether this holds true in dense and mobile urban populations. We conducted a prospective study of dengue clustering around households in highly urban Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam. Methods We enrolled 71 index cases with suspected dengue (subsequently classified as 52 dengue cases and 19 non-dengue controls); each initiated the enrollment of a cluster of 25-35 household members and neighbors who were followed up over 14 days. Incident DENV infections in cluster participants were identified by RT-PCR, NS1-ELISA, and/or DENV-IgM/IgG seroconversion, and recent infections by DENV-IgM positivity at baseline. Principal Findings/Conclusions There was no excess risk of DENV infection within dengue case clusters during the two-week follow-up, compared to control clusters, but the prevalence of recent DENV infection at baseline was two-fold higher in case clusters than controls (OR 2.3, 95% CI 1.0-5.1, p = 0.05). Prevalence of DENV infection in Aedes aegypti was similar in case and control houses, and low overall (1%). Our findings are broadly consistent with household clustering of dengue risk, but indicate that any clustering is at a short temporal scale rather than sustained chains of localized transmission. This suggests that reactive perifocal insecticide spraying may have a limited impact in this setting.","[Anders, Katherine L.; Nguyen Thi Van Thuy; Huynh Thi Le Duyen; Vu Tuan Trung; Duong Thi Hue Kien; Marcel Wolbers; Wills, Bridget; Simmons, Cameron P.] Univ Oxford, Clin Res Unit, Wellcome Trust Major Overseas Programme, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam; [Anders, Katherine L.; Marcel Wolbers; Wills, Bridget; Simmons, Cameron P.] Univ Oxford, Ctr Trop Med, Oxford, England; [Anders, Katherine L.] Monash Univ, Dept Epidemiol & Prevent Med, Melbourne, Vic 3004, Australia; [Le Hong Nga; Nguyen Dac Tho] Prevent Med Ctr, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam; [Tran Van Ngoc; Cao Thi Tam; Luong Thi Hue Tai; Nguyen Thanh Truong; Nguyen Van Vinh Chau] Hosp Trop Dis, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam; [Simmons, Cameron P.] Univ Melbourne, Dept Microbiol & Immunol, Melbourne, Vic, Australia","Anders, KL (reprint author), Univ Oxford, Clin Res Unit, Wellcome Trust Major Overseas Programme, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam.",katieanders99@gmail.com,,"/0000-0003-2223-883X; Simmons, Cameron P./0000-0002-9039-7392","Oxford University-Li Ka Shing Foundation Global Health Programme [LG-05, LG-10]; Wellcome Trust [084368/Z/07/Z]","This work was funded by the Oxford University-Li Ka Shing Foundation Global Health Programme (grant numbers LG-05 and LG-10 to KLA).

This infection is characterized by an uncontrolled parasitization of internal organs which, when left untreated, leads to death. Disease progression is linked with the type of immune response generated and a strong correlation was found between disease progression and serum levels of the immunosuppressive cytokine IL-10. Other studies have suggested a role for B cells in the pathology of this parasitic infection and the recent identification of a B-cell population in humans with regulatory functions, which secretes large amounts of IL-10 following activation, have sparked our interest in the context of visceral leishmaniasis. We report here that incubation of human B cells with Leishmania infantum amastigotes resulted in upregulation of multiple cell surface activation markers and a dose-dependent secretion of IL-10. Conditioned media from B cells incubated with Leishmania infantum amastigotes were shown to strongly inhibit CD4(+) T-cell activation, proliferation and function (i.e. as monitored by TNF and IFN gamma secretion). Blockade of IL-10 activity using a soluble IL-10 receptor restored only partially TNF and IFN gamma production to control levels. The parasite-mediated IL-10 secretion was shown to rely on the activity of Syk, phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase and p38, as well as to require intracellular calcium mobilization. Cell sorting experiments allowed us to identify the IL-10-secreting B-cell subset (i.e. CD19(+)CD24(+)CD27(-)). In summary, exposure of human B cells to Leishmania infantum amastigotes triggers B cells with regulatory activities mediated in part by IL-10, which could favor parasite dissemination in the organism.","[Andreani, Guadalupe; Ouellet, Michel; Menasria, Rym; Gomez, Alejandro Martin; Barat, Corinne; Tremblay, Michel J.] Ctr Hosp Univ CHU Quebec, Ctr Rech, Axe Malad Infect & Immunitaires, Quebec City, PQ, Canada; [Tremblay, Michel J.] Univ Laval, Fac Med, Dept Microbiol Infectiol & Immunol, Quebec City, PQ G1K 7P4, Canada","Andreani, G (reprint author), Ctr Hosp Univ CHU Quebec, Ctr Rech, Axe Malad Infect & Immunitaires, Pavillon CHUL, Quebec City, PQ, Canada.",michel.j.tremblay@crchul.ulaval.ca,"Ouellet, Michel/C-9942-2015","Ouellet, Michel/0000-0002-2353-7535; Gomez, Alejandro Martin/0000-0001-6955-5977","Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR) [HOP-84555, HBF-137703]","This work was supported by operating grants to MJT from the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR) (HOP-84555 and HBF-137703).

Two drugs are currently used for the etiological treatment of the disease: Nifurtimox (Lampit) and Benznidazole. This study presents a quasi-experimental trial (non-control group) of sixty-two patients who were treated for Chagas disease with Nifurtimox (Lampit), and were then followed for 30 months post-treatment. The safety of Nifurtimox (Lampit) for Chagas disease in this group of children primarily between 4 and 19 years old was also evaluated. Materials and methods The 62 patients included in the study were selected when resulted seropositive for two out of three fundamentally different serological tests. All children were treated during two months according to protocols established by WHO. Monitoring was performed every twenty days to evaluate treatment safety. In 43 patients, two different serological tests: ELISA and IFAT; and two parasitological tests: blood culture, and real time PCR, (qPCR) were performed to assess therapeutic response, defined as post-treatment serological negativization. Principal findings All patients completed the treatment successfully, and six patients abandoned the post-treatment follow-up. Adverse effects occurred in 74% of patients, but only 4.8% of cases required temporary suspension to achieve 100% adherence to the 60-day treatment, and all symptoms reverted after treatment completion. Both parasite load (measured through qPCR) and antibodies (ELISA absorbance) evidenced a significant median reduction 6 months after treatment from 6.2 to 0.2 parasite equivalents/mL, and from 0.6 to 0.2 absorbance units respectively (p<0.001). Serological negativization by ELISA was evident since 6 months post-treatment, whereas by IFAT only after 18 months. Serological negativization by the two tests (ELISA and IFAT) was 41.9% (95% CI: 26.5-57.3) after 30 months post-treatment. qPCR was positive in 88.3% of patients pre-treatment and only in 12.1% of patientsafter 30 months. Survival analysis indicated that only 26.3%(95% CI: 15.5-44.8) persisted with negative qPCR during the whole follow-up period. Conclusions Nifurtimox was very well tolerated and successfully reduced parasite load and antibody titers. Re-infection, lysed parasites or a lack of anti-parasitic activity could explain these persistently positive qPCR cases.","[Bianchi, Fiorella; Guhl, Felipe; Lorena Gonzalez, Nadia; David Ramirez, Juan] Univ Los Andes, Ctr Invest Microbiol & Parasitol Trop, Bogota, Colombia; [Cucunuba, Zulma; Santiago Nicholls, Ruben; Montilla, Marleny; Carolina Florez, Astrid] Inst Nacl Salud, Grp Parasitol, Bogota, Colombia; [Freilij, Hector] Programa Nacl Control Chagas, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [Rosas, Fernando] Clin Abott Shaio, Bogota, Colombia; [Saavedra, Victor] Ctr Salud, Nunchia, Casanare, Colombia; [Silva, Nubia] Servinsalud Ltda, El Yopal, Casanare, Colombia","Bianchi, F (reprint author), Univ Los Andes, Ctr Invest Microbiol & Parasitol Trop, Bogota, Colombia.",fguhl@uniandes.edu.co,"Cucunuba, Zulma/L-4076-2016; Ramirez, Juan David/F-3524-2016; Oliveira, Claudia DL/G-8618-2011","Cucunuba, Zulma/0000-0002-8165-3198; Ramirez, Juan David/0000-0002-1344-9312; zaky, mohammad/0000-0003-3547-2588; Bianchi Jassir, Fiorella/0000-0002-4507-4770",Departamento Administrativo de Ciencia y Tecnologia - COLCIENCIAS [579-2008],"This work was funded by Departamento Administrativo de Ciencia y Tecnologia - COLCIENCIAS grant No. 579-2008.

In a previous study, we demonstrated high accuracy of five serology tests for the screening and diagnosis of strongyloidiasis. Aim of this study is to evaluate the performance of the same five tests for the follow up of patients infected with S. stercoralis. Methods Retrospective study on anonymized, cryo-preserved samples available at the Centre for Tropical Diseases (Negrar, Verona, Italy). Samples were collected before and from 3 to 12 months after treatment. The samples were tested with two commercially-available ELISA tests (IVD, Bordier), two techniques based on a recombinant antigen (NIE-ELISA and NIE-LIPS) and one in-house IFAT. The results of each test were evaluated both in relation to the results of fecal examination and to those of a composite reference standard (classifying as positive a sample with positive stools and/or at least three positive serology tests). The associations between the independent variables age and time and the dependent variable value of serological test (for all five tests), were analyzed by linear mixed-effects regression model. Results A high proportion of samples demonstrated for each test a seroreversion or a relevant decline (optical density/relative light units halved or decrease of at least two titers for IFAT) at follow up, results confirmed by the linear mixed effects model that showed a trend to seroreversion over time for all tests. In particular, IVD-ELISA (almost 90% samples demonstrated relevant decline) and IFAT (almost 87%) had the best performance. Considering only samples with a complete negativization, NIE-ELISA showed the best performance (72.5% seroreversion). Conclusions Serology is useful for the follow up of patients infected with S. stercoralis and determining test of cure.","[Buonfrate, Dora; Albonico, Marco; Degani, Monica; Tais, Stefano; Angheben, Andrea; Bisoffi, Zeno] Sacro Cuore Hosp, CTD, Verona, Italy; [Buonfrate, Dora; Albonico, Marco; Angheben, Andrea; Requena-Mendez, Ana; Munoz, Jose; Bisoffi, Zeno] Commiss European Communities, Coordinating Resources Assess & Improve Hlth Stat, Hlth Cooperat Work Programme, FP7,GA 261495, Milan, Italy; [Sequi, Marco] IRCCS Mario Negri Inst Pharmacol Res, Dept Publ Hlth, Milan, Italy; [Mejia, Rojelio; Nutman, Thomas B.] NIAID, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; [Cimino, Ruben O.; Krolewiecki, Alejandro J.] Univ Nacl Salta, CONICET, Inst Invest Enfermedades Trop, Oran, Argentina; [Requena-Mendez, Ana; Munoz, Jose] Univ Barcelona, Hosp Clin, Barcelona Ctr Int Hlth Res CRESIB, Barcelona, Spain","Buonfrate, D (reprint author), Sacro Cuore Hosp, CTD, Verona, Italy.",dora.buonfrate@sacrocuore.it,"Angheben, Andrea/H-6248-2019; Buonfrate, Dora/N-2965-2016; Munoz Gutierrez, Jose/X-5917-2018; Mendez, Ana Requena/U-5158-2018","Buonfrate, Dora/0000-0003-0108-6822; Munoz Gutierrez, Jose/0000-0002-0945-1735; Mendez, Ana Requena/0000-0002-4422-241X; Mejia, Rojelio/0000-0003-4134-4558; ALBONICO, Marco/0000-0002-7805-2391",EC within the 7th Framework Programme under the COHEMI project [FP7-GA-261495]; Division of Intramural Research of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID),"This work has been partly supported by the EC within the 7th Framework Programme under the COHEMI project - grant agreement n.

PCM is of major importance, especially in Latin America, and its treatment relies on the use of antifungal drugs. However, the course of treatment is lengthy, leading to side effects and even development of fungal resistance. The goal of the study was to use low-level laser therapy (LLLT) to stimulate PMN to fight Pb in vivo. Swiss mice with subcutaneous air pouches were inoculated with a virulent strain of Pb or fungal cell wall components (Zymosan), and then received LLLT (780 nm; 50 mW; 12.5 J/cm2; 30 seconds per point, giving a total energy of 0.5 J per point) on alternate days at two points on each hind leg. The aim was to reach the bone marrow in the femur with light. Non-irradiated animals were used as controls. The number and viability of the PMN that migrated to the inoculation site was assessed, as well as their ability to synthesize proteins, produce reactive oxygen species (ROS) and their fungicidal activity. The highly pure PMN populations obtained after 10 days of infection were also subsequently cultured in the presence of Pb for trials of protein production, evaluation of mitochondrial activity, ROS production and quantification of viable fungi growth. PMN from mice that received LLLT were more active metabolically, had higher fungicidal activity against Pb in vivo and also in vitro. The kinetics of neutrophil protein production also correlated with a more activated state. LLLT may be a safe and non-invasive approach to deal with PCM infection.","[Burger, Eva; Mendes, Ana Carolina S. C.; Bani, Giulia M. A.

Since it is unknown which animals can act as a reservoir and/or definitive hosts for Amphimerus sp. in this endemic area, a study was done to determine the prevalence of infection in domestic cats and dogs. This information is important to understand the epidemiology, life cycle and control of this parasite. Methodology/Findings In July 2012, three Chachi communities located on Rio Cayapas, province of Esmeraldas, were surveyed. A total of 89 of the 109 registered households participated in the study. Of the 27 cats and 43 dogs found residing in the communities, stool samples were collected from 14 cats and 31 dogs (total of 45 animals) and examined microscopically for the presence of Amphimerus eggs. The prevalence of infection was 71.4% in cats and 38.7% in dogs, with similar rates of infection in all three communities. Significantly more cats were infected than dogs (p = 0.042). Conclusions/Significance The data show a high rate of Amphimerus sp. infection in domestic cats and dogs residing in Chachi communities. It can be concluded that these animals act as definitive and reservoir hosts for this liver fluke and that amphimeriasis is a zoonotic disease. These findings provide important epidemiological data which will aid in the development and implementation of control strategies against the transmission of Amphimerus.","[Calvopina, Manuel; Cevallos, William; Atherton, Richard] Univ Cent, Ctr Biomed, Carrera Med, Quito, Ecuador; [Saunders, Matthew] Royal Liverpool Univ Hosp, Liverpool, Merseyside, England; [Small, Alexander] Sandwell & West Birmingham Hosp NHS Trust, Birmingham, W Midlands, England; [Kumazawa, Hideo] Kochi Med Sch, Dept Parasitol, Kochi, Japan; [Sugiyama, Hiromu] Natl Inst Infect Dis, Dept Parasitol, Tokyo, Japan","Calvopina, M (reprint author), Univ Cent, Ctr Biomed, Carrera Med, Quito, Ecuador.",manuelcalvopina@gmail.com,,"Calvopina, Manuel/0000-0003-0093-7955","Universidad Central del Ecuador [CUP 91750000.0000.374072]; Japan Society for the Promotion of Science, JSPS (KAKENHI) [25305011]; Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare of Japan [H23-Shinko-ippan-014, H26-Shinkoippan-009]","This study was funded by the grants from the Universidad Central del Ecuador (CUP 91750000.0000.374072) and in part by the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science, JSPS (KAKENHI: Grant No. 25305011) and by grants for Research on Emerging and Re-emerging Infectious Diseases (H23-Shinko-ippan-014 and H26-Shinkoippan-009) from the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare of Japan.

DIPTERA; CHIANG-MAI; SAO-PAULO,"Introduction The mosquito Aedes aegypti, vector of dengue, chikungunya and yellow fever viruses, is an important target of vector control programs in tropical countries. Most mosquito surveillance programs are still based on the traditional household larval surveys, despite the availability of new trapping devices. We report the results of a multicentric entomological survey using four types of traps, besides the larval survey, to compare the entomological indices generated by these different surveillance tools in terms of their sensitivity to detect mosquito density variation. Methods The study was conducted in five mid-sized cities, representing variations of tropical climate regimens. Surveillance schemes using traps for adults (BG-Sentinel, Adultrap and Mosqui-TRAP) or eggs (ovitraps) were applied monthly to three 1 km(2) areas per city. Simultaneously, larval surveys were performed. Trap positivity and density indices in each area were calculated and regressed against meteorological variables to characterize the seasonal pattern of mosquito infestation in all cities, as measured by each of the four traps. Results The House Index was consistently low in most cities, with median always 0. Traps rarely produced null indices, pointing to their greater sensitivity in detecting the presence of Ae. aegypti in comparison to the larval survey. Trap positivity indices tend to plateau at high mosquito densities. Despite this, both indices, positivity and density, agreed on the seasonality of mosquito abundance in all cities. Mosquito seasonality associated preferentially with temperature than with precipitation even in areas where temperature variation is small. Conclusions All investigated traps performed better than the House Index in measuring the seasonal variation in mosquito abundance and should be considered as complements or alternatives to larval surveys. Choice between traps should further consider differences of cost and ease-of-use.","[Codeco, Claudia T.] Fundacao Oswaldo Cruz, Programa Comp Cient, Rio De Janeiro, Brazil; [Lima, Arthur W.

Current treatment recommendations include 8 weeks of combination antibiotics, with adjuvant surgery if necessary. However, antibiotic toxicity often results in early treatment cessation and local experience suggests that shorter antibiotic courses may be effective with concurrent surgery. We report the outcomes of patients in the Barwon Health M. ulcerans cohort who received shorter courses of antibiotic therapy than 8 weeks. Methodology / Principal findings A retrospective analysis was performed of all M. ulcerans infections treated at Barwon Health from March 1, 1998 to July 31, 2013. Sixty-two patients, with a median age of 65 years, received < 56 days of antibiotics and 51 (82%) of these patients underwent concurrent surgical excision. Most received a two-drug regimen of rifampicin combined with either ciprofloxacin or clarithromycin for a median 29 days (IQR 21-41days). Cessation rates were 55% for adverse events and 36% based on clinician decision. The overall success rate was 95% (98% with concurrent surgery; 82% with antibiotics alone) with a 50% success rate for those who received < 14 days of antibiotics increasing to 94% if they received 14-27 days and 100% for 28-55 days (p<0.01). A 100% success rate was seen for concurrent surgery and 14-27 days of antibiotics versus 67% for concurrent surgery and < 14 days of antibiotics (p = 0.12). No previously identified risk factors for treatment failure with surgery alone were associated with reduced treatment success rates with < 56 days of antibiotics. Conclusion In selected patients, antibiotic treatment durations for M. ulcerans shorter than the current WHO recommended 8 weeks duration may be associated with successful outcomes.","[Cowan, Raquel; Athan, Eugene; Friedman, N.

In this study, we explored the level of CD8+ T lymphocyte activation in the first six days after onset of symptoms during a DENV2 outbreak in early 2010 on the coast of Sao Paulo State, Brazil. Using flow cytometry we detected a progressive increase in the percentage of CD8+ T cells in 74 dengue fever cases. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 30 cases were thawed and evaluated using expanded phenotyping. The expansion of the CD8+ T cells was coupled with increased Ki67 expression. Cell activation was observed later in the course of disease, as determined by the expression of the activation markers CD38 and HLA-DR. This increased CD8+ T lymphocyte activation was observed in all memory subsets, but was more pronounced in the effector memory subset, as defined by higher CD38 expression. Our results show that most CD8+ T cell subsets are expanded during DENV2 infection and that the effector memory subset is the predominantly affected sub population.","[de Matos, Andreia Manso; Carvalho, Karina Inacio; Rosa, Daniela Santoro; Kallas, Esper George] Univ Sao Paulo, Fac Med, Disciplina Imunol Clin & Alergia LIM 60, Sao Paulo, Brazil; [Carvalho, Karina Inacio] Albert Einstein Hosp, Sao Paulo, Brazil; [Rosa, Daniela Santoro] Fed Univ Sao Paulo UNIFESP, Div Immunol, Sao Paulo, Brazil; [Villas-Boas, Lucy Santos; da Silva, Wanessa Cardoso; de Lima Rodrigues, Celia Luiza; Levi, Jose Eduardo; Pannuti, Claudio Sergio; Albuquerque Luna, Expedito Jose] Univ Sao Paulo, Inst Med Trop Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil; [Villas-Boas, Lucy Santos; da Silva, Wanessa Cardoso; de Lima Rodrigues, Celia Luiza; Levi, Jose Eduardo; Pannuti, Claudio Sergio; Albuquerque Luna, Expedito Jose] Univ Sao Paulo, Fac Med, Dept Molestias Infecciosas & Parasitarias LIM 52, Sao Paulo, Brazil; [Peel Furtado Oliveira, Olimpia Massae Nakasone; Affonso Araujo, Evaldo Stanislau] Hosp Ana Costa, Sao Paulo, Brazil; [Affonso Araujo, Evaldo Stanislau] Univ Sao Paulo, Fac Med, Dept Molestias Infecciosas & Parasitarias LIM 47, Sao Paulo, Brazil","de Matos, AM (reprint author), Univ Sao Paulo, Fac Med, Disciplina Imunol Clin & Alergia LIM 60, Sao Paulo, Brazil.",esper.kallas@usp.br,"Silva, Wanessa/C-7837-2012; Luna, Expedito J A/B-7948-2012; Rosa, Daniela/D-2190-2012; Carvalho, Karina/O-4244-2019","Luna, Expedito J A/0000-0002-1145-9672; Rosa, Daniela/0000-0003-4536-891X; Carvalho, Karina/0000-0002-7763-8139; Kallas, Esper/0000-0003-2026-6925","Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico, Brazilian Ministry of Science and Technology (CNPq) [476088/2009-7]; CNPq; Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior, Brazilian Ministry of Education","The present work was supported by the Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico, Brazilian Ministry of Science and Technology (CNPq, grant #476088/2009-7 to EGK).

Though several diagnostic methods are available, almost all of them present with some limitations. Method/Principle Findings A latex immunoassay using sensitized latex particles (SLPs) with gp43 antigen, the immunodominant antigen of Paracoccidioides brasiliensis, or the monoclonal antibody mAb17c (anti-gp43) was evaluated for antibody or antigen detection in sera, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) from patients with PCM due to P. brasiliensis. The gp43-SLPs performed optimally to detect specific antibodies with high levels of sensitivity (98.46%, 95% CI 91.7-100.0), specificity (93.94%, 95% CI 87.3-97.7), and positive (91.4%) and negative (98.9%) predictive values. In addition, we propose the use of mAb17c-SLPs to detect circulating gp43, which would be particularly important in patients with immune deficiencies who fail to produce normal levels of immunoglobulins, achieving good levels of sensitivity (96.92%, 95% CI 89.3-99.6), specificity (88.89%, 95% CI 81.0-94.3), and positive (85.1%) and negative (97.8%) predictive values. Very good agreement between latex tests and double immune diffusion was observed for gp43-SLPs (k = 0.924) and mAb17c-SLPs (k = 0.850), which reinforces the usefulness of our tests for the rapid diagnosis of PCM in less than 10 minutes. Minor cross-reactivity occurred with sera from patients with other fungal infections. We successfully detected antigens and antibodies from CSF and BAL samples. In addition, the latex test was useful for monitoring PCM patients receiving therapy. Conclusions/Significance The high diagnostic accuracy, low cost, reduced assay time, and simplicity of this new latex test offer the potential to be commercialized and makes it an attractive diagnostic assay for use not only in clinics and medical mycology laboratories, but mainly in remote locations with limited laboratory infrastructure and/or minimally trained community health workers.","[dos Santos, Priscila Oliveira; Rodrigues, Anderson Messias; Fernandes, Geisa Ferreira; de Camargo, Zoilo Pires] Univ Fed Sao Paulo, Dept Microbiol Immunol & Parasitol, Div Cell Biol, Sao Paulo, Brazil; [Marques da Silva, Silvia Helena] Evandro Chagas Inst, Bacteriol & Mycol Div, Ananindeua, Para, Brazil; [Burger, Eva] Univ Fed Alfenas, Inst Biomed Sci, Alfenas, MG, Brazil","dos Santos, PO (reprint author), Univ Fed Sao Paulo, Dept Microbiol Immunol & Parasitol, Div Cell Biol, Sao Paulo, Brazil.",zpcamargo1@gmail.com,"Camargo, Zoilo/C-5305-2013; Rodrigues, Anderson M./V-4069-2019; Rodrigues, Anderson/C-5915-2013; Marques-da-Silva, Silvia Helena/E-9687-2016","Camargo, Zoilo/0000-0002-2971-7983; Rodrigues, Anderson M./0000-0003-0891-4563; Rodrigues, Anderson/0000-0003-0891-4563; Marques-da-Silva, Silvia Helena/0000-0002-0956-4553; Oliveira Fideles dos Santos, Priscila/0000-0001-5427-3379","Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo [FAPESP 2011/07350-1]; FAPESP [2011/01628-8, 2009/54181-0, 2009/54024-2]; Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico; FAPESP; CNPq; CAPES","AMR is a fellow and acknowledges the financial support of the Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo (FAPESP 2011/07350-1).

Early case detection and subsequent antibiotic treatment are essential to counteract the progression of the characteristic chronic ulcerative lesions. Since the accuracy of clinical BU diagnosis is limited, laboratory reconfirmation is crucial. However, currently available diagnostic techniques with sufficient sensitivity and specificity require infrastructure and resources only accessible at a few reference centres in the African endemic countries. Hence, the development of a simple, rapid, sensitive and specific point-of-care diagnostic tool is one of the major research priorities for BU. In this study, we have identified a previously unknown M. ulcerans protein, MUL_3720, as a promising target for antigen capture-based detection assays. We show that MUL_3720 is highly expressed by M. ulcerans and has no orthologs in other prevalent pathogenic mycobacteria. We generated a panel of anti-MUL_3720 antibodies and used them to confirm a cell wall location for MUL_3720. These antibodies could also specifically detect M. ulcerans in infected human tissue samples as well as in lysates of infected mouse footpads. A bacterial 2-hybrid screen suggested a potential role for MUL_3720 in cell wall biosynthesis pathways. Finally, we demonstrate that a combination of MUL_3720 specific antibody reagents in a sandwich-ELISA format has sufficient sensitivity to make them suitable for the development of antigen capture-based diagnostic tests for BU.","[Dreyer, Anita; Roeltgen, Katharina; Dangy, Jean Pierre; Ruf, Marie Therese; Scherr, Nicole; Bolz, Miriam; Moes, Charles; Vettiger, Andrea; Pluschke, Gerd] Swiss Trop & Publ Hlth Inst, Mol Immunol, Basel, Switzerland; [Dreyer, Anita; Roeltgen, Katharina; Dangy, Jean Pierre; Ruf, Marie Therese; Scherr, Nicole; Bolz, Miriam; Moes, Charles; Vettiger, Andrea; Pluschke, Gerd] Univ Basel, Basel, Switzerland; [Tobias, Nicholas Jay; Stinear, Timothy Paul] Univ Melbourne, Dept Microbiol & Immunol, Parkville, Vic 3052, Australia","Dreyer, A (reprint author), GlycoVaxyn AG, Schlieren, Switzerland.",gerd.pluschke@unibas.ch,,"Stinear, Timothy/0000-0003-0150-123X; Tobias, Nicholas/0000-0003-2725-3043; Vettiger, Andrea/0000-0002-1245-0987",Stop Buruli Initiative - UBS-Optimus Foundation,"This work was supported by the Stop Buruli Initiative funded by the UBS-Optimus Foundation.

There are recurrent sporadic outbreaks in the traditionally endemic areas in south-east Uganda, and continued spread to new unaffected areas in central Uganda. We evaluated the evolutionary dynamics underpinning the origin of new foci and the impact of host species on parasite genetic diversity in Uganda. We genotyped 269 Trypanosoma brucei isolates collected from different regions in Uganda and southwestern Kenya at 17 microsatellite loci, and checked for the presence of the SRA gene that confers human infectivity to T. b. rhodesiense. Results Both Bayesian clustering methods and Discriminant Analysis of Principal Components partition Trypanosoma brucei isolates obtained from Uganda and southwestern Kenya into three distinct genetic clusters. Clusters 1 and 3 include isolates from central and southern Uganda, while cluster 2 contains mostly isolates from southwestern Kenya. These three clusters are not sorted by subspecies designation (T. b. brucei vs T. b. rhodesiense), host or date of collection. The analyses also show evidence of genetic admixture among the three genetic clusters and long-range dispersal, suggesting recent and possibly on-going gene flow between them. Conclusions Our results show that the expansion of the disease to the new foci in central Uganda occurred from the northward spread of T. b. rhodesiense (Tbr). They also confirm the emergence of the human infective strains (Tbr) from non-infective T. b. brucei (Tbb) strains of different genetic backgrounds, and the importance of cattle as Tbr reservoir, as confounders that shape the epidemiology of sleeping sickness in the region.","[Echodu, Richard; Opiyo, Elizabeth] Gulu Univ, Fac Sci, Gulu, Uganda; [Sistrom, Mark; Caccone, Adalgisa] Yale Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, New Haven, CT USA; [Bateta, Rosemary; Murilla, Grace] Kenya Agr Res Inst, Trypanosomiasis Res Ctr, Kikuyu, Kenya; [Okedi, Loyce] Natl Livestock Resources Res Inst, Natl Agr Res Org, Tororo, Uganda; [Aksoy, Serap; Enyioha, Chineme; Caccone, Adalgisa] Yale Univ, Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Epidemiol Microbial Dis, New Haven, CT USA; [Enyaru, John] Makerere Univ, Sch Biol Sci, Kampala, Uganda; [Gibson, Wendy] Univ Bristol, Sch Biol Sci, Bristol, Avon, England","Echodu, R (reprint author), Gulu Univ, Fac Sci, Gulu, Uganda.",mark.sistrom@yale.edu,"Gibson, Wendy/E-4182-2014; Aksoy, Serap/K-2244-2019","Aksoy, Serap/0000-0001-9941-143X; Echodu, Richard/0000-0002-1979-1012",NIH [AI094615-01],"This work was supported by NIH R21 grant AI094615-01 awarded to AC and SA.

IgG shortages leave immunodeficient patients without treatment, exposing them to devastating recurrent infections from local pathogens. A simple and practical method for producing IgG from normal or convalescent plasma collected in developing countries is needed to provide better, faster access to IgG for patients in need. Methodology/Principal Findings IgG was purified from 10 consecutive minipools of 20 plasma donations collected in Egypt using single-use equipment. Plasma donations in their collection bags were subjected to 5%-pH5.5 caprylic acid treatment for 90 min at 31 degrees C, and centrifuged to remove the precipitate. Supernatants were pooled, then dialyzed and concentrated using a commercial disposable hemodialyzer. The final preparation was filtered online by gravity, aseptically dispensed into storage transfusion bags, and frozen at <-20 degrees C. The resulting preparation had a mean protein content of 60.5 g/L, 90.2% immunoglobulins, including 83.2% IgG, 12.4% IgA, and 4.4% IgM, and residual albumin. There was fourfold to sixfold enrichment of anti-hepatitis B and anti-rubella antibodies. Analyses of aggregates (<3%), prekallicrein (5-7 IU/mL), plasmin (26.3 mU/mL), thrombin (2.5mU/mL), thrombin-like activity (0.011 U/g), thrombin generation capacity (<223 nM), and Factor XI (<0.01 U/mL) activity, Factor XI/XIa antigen (2.4 ng/g) endotoxin (<0.5 EU/mL), and general safety test in rats showed the in vitro safety profile. Viral validation revealed >5 logs reduction of HIV, BVDV, and PRV infectivity in less than 15 min of caprylic acid treatment. Conclusions/Significance 90% pure, virally-inactivated immunoglobulins can be prepared from plasma minipools using simple disposable equipment and bag systems. This easy-to-implement process could be used to produce immunoglobulins from local plasma in developing countries to treat immunodeficient patients. It is also relevant for preparing hyperimmune IgG from convalescent plasma during infectious outbreaks such as the current Ebola virus episode.","[El-Ekiaby, Magdy; Gorgy, George] Shabrawishi Hosp, Shabrawishi Blood Bank, Cairo, Egypt; [Vargas, Mariangela] Univ Costa Rica, Fac Microbiol, Inst Clodomiro Picado, San Jose, Costa Rica; [Sayed, Makram] Fayoum Univ, Environm & Food Pollutant Lab, Al Fayyum, Egypt; [Goubran, Hadi] Univ Saskatchewan, Coll Med, Saskatoon Canc Ctr, Saskatoon, SK S7N 0W0, Canada; [Radosevic, Mirjana] Human Prot Proc Sci, Lille, France; [Burnouf, Thierry] Taipei Med Univ, Coll Oral Med, Grad Inst Biomed Mat & Tissue Engn, Taipei, Taiwan","El-Ekiaby, M (reprint author), Shabrawishi Hosp, Shabrawishi Blood Bank, Cairo, Egypt.",thburnouf@gmail.com,"Burnouf, Thierry/H-4784-2019",,Shabrawishi Hospital,"The study was supported by Shabrawishi Hospital.

We therefore revisited the possible role of bovines in schistosome transmission in the Philippines, using the recently described formalin-ethyl acetate sedimentation (FEA-SD) technique and a qPCR assay to examine fecal samples from 153 bovines (both carabao and cattle) from six baran-gays in Northern Samar. A high prevalence of S. japonicum was found using qPCR and FEA-SD in both cattle (87.50% and 77.08%, respectively) and carabao (80.00% and 55.24%, respectively). The average daily egg output for each bovine was calculated at 195,000. High prevalence and infection intensity of F. gigantica was also found in the bovines by qPCR and FEA-SD (95.33% and 96.00%, respectively). The identification of bovines as major reservoir hosts for S. japonicum transmission suggests that bovine treatment and/or vaccination, as one becomes available, should be included in any future control program that aims to reduce the disease burden due to schistosomiasis in the Philippines.","[Gordon, Catherine A.; Gobert, Geoffrey N.; Gray, Darren J.; Li, Yuesheng; McManus, Donald P.] QIMR Berghofer Inst Med, Div Infect Dis, Mol Parasitol Lab, Brisbane, Qld, Australia; [Gordon, Catherine A.; Gray, Darren J.] Univ Queensland, Sch Populat Hlth, Infect Dis Epidemiol Unit, Brisbane, Qld, Australia; [Acosta, Luz P.; Jiz, Mario; Olveda, Remigio M.] Res Inst Trop Med, Dept Immunol, Manila, Philippines; [Ross, Allen G.] Griffith Univ, Griffith Hlth Inst, Brisbane, Qld 4111, Australia; [Gray, Darren J.] Australian Natl Univ, Res Sch Populat Hlth, Canberra, ACT, Australia; [Williams, Gail M.] Univ Queensland, Sch Populat Hlth, Discipline Epidemiol & Biostat, Brisbane, Qld, Australia; [Harn, Donald] Univ Georgia, Coll Vet Med, Athens, GA USA","Gordon, CA (reprint author), QIMR Berghofer Inst Med, Div Infect Dis, Mol Parasitol Lab, Brisbane, Qld, Australia.",Catherine.Gordon@qimrberghofer.edu.au; Don.McManus@qimrberghofer.edu.au,"Gobert, Geoffrey/V-2985-2019; McManus, Donald P./G-2678-2013","Gobert, Geoffrey/0000-0001-5884-6453; Williams, Gail/0000-0002-4822-5263; Gray, Darren/0000-0003-3525-1339; Gordon, Catherine/0000-0002-1509-5220","National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) of Australia [496600, 1037304, 613671]; UBS Optimus","Funding was provided by the National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) of Australia (Program grant ID 496600 and ID 1037304, and project grant ID 613671) and UBS Optimus.

In the study, we investigated spatio-temporal variations of S. japonicum infection risk in Anhui Province and assessed the associations of the disease with key environmental factors with the aim of understanding the mechanism of the disease and seeking clues to effective and sustainable schistosomiasis control. Methodology/Principal Findings Infection data of schistosomiasis from annual conventional surveys were obtained at the village level in Anhui Province, China, from 2000 to 2010 and used in combination with environmental data. The spatio-temporal kriging model was used to assess how these environmental factors affected the spatio-temporal pattern of schistosomiasis risk. Our results suggested that seasonal variation of the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), seasonal variation of land surface temperature at daytime (LSTD), and distance to the Yangtze River were negatively significantly associated with risk of schistosomiasis. Predictive maps showed that schistosomiasis prevalence remained at a low level and schistosomiasis risk mainly evolved along the Yangtze River. Schistosomiasis risk also followed a focal spatial pattern, fluctuating temporally with a peak (the largest spatial extent) in 2005 and then contracting gradually but with a scattered distribution until 2010. Conclusion The fitted spatio-temporal kriging model can capture variations of schistosomiasis risk over space and time. Combined with techniques of geographic information system (GIS) and remote sensing (RS), this approach facilitates and enriches risk modeling of schistosomiasis, which in turn helps to identify prior areas for effective and sustainable control of schistosomiasis in Anhui Province and perhaps elsewhere in China.","[Hu, Yi; Li, Rui; Lynn, Henry; Sun, Liqian; Zhang, Zhijie; Jiang, Qingwu] Fudan Univ, Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Epidemiol & Biostat, Shanghai 200433, Peoples R China; [Hu, Yi; Li, Rui; Lynn, Henry; Sun, Liqian; Zhang, Zhijie; Jiang, Qingwu] Minist Educ, Key Lab Publ Hlth Safety, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Hu, Yi; Li, Rui; Lynn, Henry; Sun, Liqian; Zhang, Zhijie; Jiang, Qingwu] Fudan Univ, Sch Publ Hlth, Lab Spatial Anal & Modeling, Shanghai 200433, Peoples R China; [Bergquist, Robert] Ingerod, Brastad, Sweden; [Lynn, Henry; Zhang, Zhijie] Fudan Univ, Biomed Stat Ctr, Shanghai 200433, Peoples R China; [Gao, Fenghua; Wang, Qizhi; Zhang, Shiqing] Anhui Inst Parasit Dis, Wuhu, Peoples R China","Hu, Y (reprint author), Fudan Univ, Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Epidemiol & Biostat, Shanghai 200433, Peoples R China.",epistat@gmail.com,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China [81102167, 81172609, J1210041]; Specialized Research Fund for the Doctoral Program of Higher Education, SRFDP [20110071120040]; Foundation for the Author of National Excellent Doctoral Dissertation of PR China (FANEDD) [201186]; National ST Major Program [2012ZX10004220, 2008ZX10004-011]; Talent Programs for Fostering Outstanding Youth of Shanghai [XYQ2013071]; Independent Research Project of Fudan University [20520133105]; Opening Fund of Key Laboratory of Poyang Lake Wetland and Watershed Research(Jiangxi Normal University), Ministry of Education [PK2014001]; China Postdoctoral Science Foundation [2014M560291]","This research was supported by grants awarded to YH, ZZ, QJ and National Natural Science Foundation of China [grants number: 81102167, 81172609, and J1210041], Specialized Research Fund for the Doctoral Program of Higher Education, SRFDP (grant number: 20110071120040), a Foundation for the Author of National Excellent Doctoral Dissertation of PR China (FANEDD) (201186), the National S&T Major Program (2012ZX10004220, 2008ZX10004-011), the Talent Programs for Fostering Outstanding Youth of Shanghai (XYQ2013071), the Independent Research Project of Fudan University (20520133105), the Opening Fund of Key Laboratory of Poyang Lake Wetland and Watershed Research(Jiangxi Normal University), Ministry of Education(PK2014001), and the China Postdoctoral Science Foundation (No. 2014M560291).

However, so far, no large scale evaluation of RDTs has been performed for diagnosis of Trypanosoma brucei gambiense HAT in West Africa. The objective of this study was to assess the diagnostic accuracy of 2 commercial HAT-RDTs on stored plasma samples from West Africa. Methodology/Principal findings SD Bioline HAT and HAT Sero-K-Set were performed on 722 plasma samples originating from Guinea and Cote d'Ivoire, including 231 parasitologically confirmed HAT patients, 257 healthy controls, and 234 unconfirmed individuals whose blood tested antibody positive in the card agglutination test but negative by parasitological tests. Immune trypanolysis was performed as a reference test for trypanosome specific antibody presence. Sensitivities in HAT patients were respectively 99.6% for SD Bioline HAT, and 99.1% for HAT Sero-K-Set, specificities in healthy controls were respectively 87.9% and 88.3%. Considering combined positivity in both RDTs, increased the specificity significantly (p <= 0.0003) to 93.4%, while 98.7% sensitivity was maintained. Specificities in controls were 98.7-99.6% for the combination of one or two RDTs with trypanolysis, maintaining a sensitivity of at least 98.1%. Conclusions/Significance The observed specificity of the single RDTs was relatively low. Serial application of SD Bioline HAT and HAT Sero-K-Set might offer superior specificity compared to a single RDT, maintaining high sensitivity. The combination of one or two RDTs with trypanolysis seems promising for HAT surveillance.","[Jamonneau, Vincent; Ilboudo, Hamidou; Peylhard, Moana; Sakande, Hassane; Sanou, Djeneba; Dama, Emilie] CIRDES, Bobo Dioulasso, Burkina Faso; [Jamonneau, Vincent; Peylhard, Moana; Lejon, Veerle] IRD, Unite Mixte Rech IRD CIRAD 177, Montpellier, France; [Camara, Oumou; Camara, Mamadou] Programme Natl Lutte Trypanosomose Humaine Africa, Conakry, Guinea; [Koffi, Mathurin] Univ Jean Lorougnon GUEDE UJLoG, UFR Environm, Lab Interact Hote Microorganismes Environm & Evol, Daloa, Cote Ivoire; [N'Dri, Louis] IPR, Unite Rech Trypanosomoses, Bouake, Cote Ivoire","Jamonneau, V (reprint author), CIRDES, Bobo Dioulasso, Burkina Faso.",veerle.lejon@ird.fr,"Jamonneau, Vincent/K-1124-2016","Jamonneau, Vincent/0000-0001-8427-0769; Lejon, Veerle/0000-0002-6795-0962; ILBOUDO, Hamidou/0000-0003-3936-7718",,,,20,17,18,0,5,PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE,SAN FRANCISCO,"1160 BATTERY STREET, STE 100, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94111 USA",1935-2735,,,PLOS NEGLECT TROP D,Plos Neglect.

As platelet activating factor (PAF) is associated with an increase in vascular permeability in other diseases, we set out to investigate its role in acute dengue infection. Materials and Methods PAF levels were initially assessed in 25 patients with acute dengue infection to determine if they were increased in acute dengue. For investigation of the kinetics of PAF, serial PAF values were assessed in 36 patients. The effect of dengue serum on tight junction protein ZO-1 was determined by using human endothelial cell lines (HUVECs). The effect of dengue serum on and trans-endothelial resistance (TEER) was also measured on HUVECs. Results PAF levels were significantly higher in patients with acute dengue (n = 25; p = 0.001) when compared to healthy individuals (n = 12). In further investigation of the kinetics of PAF in serial blood samples of patients (n = 36), PAF levels rose just before the onset of the critical phase. PAF levels were significantly higher in patients with evidence of vascular leak throughout the course of the illness when compared to those with milder disease. Serum from patients with dengue significantly down-regulated expression of tight junction protein, ZO-1 (p = 0.004), HUVECs. This was significantly inhibited (p = 0.004) by use of a PAF receptor (PAFR) blocker. Serum from dengue patients also significantly reduced TEER and this reduction was also significantly (p = 0.02) inhibited by prior incubation with the PAFR blocker. Conclusion Our results suggest the PAF is likely to be playing a significant role in inducing vascular leak in acute dengue infection which offers a potential target for therapeutic intervention.","[Jeewandara, Chandima; Gomes, Laksiri; Wickramasinghe, N.; Paranavitane, S.

Mass dog vaccination is considered to be the most effective method to prevent rabies in humans. Our objective was to systematically review research articles on dog rabies parenteral vaccination coverage in Africa in relation to dog accessibility and vaccination cost recovery arrangement (i.e. free of charge or owner charged). Methodology/Principal Findings A systematic literature search was made in the databases of CAB abstracts (EBSCOhost and OvidSP), Scopus, Web of Science, PubMed, Medline (EBSCOhost and OvidSP) and AJOL (African Journal Online) for peer reviewed articles on 1) rabies control, 2) dog rabies vaccination coverage and 3) dog demography in Africa. Identified articles were subsequently screened and selected using predefined selection criteria like year of publication (viz. >= 1990), type of study (cross sectional), objective(s) of the study (i.e. vaccination coverage rates, dog demographics and financial arrangements of vaccination costs), language of publication (English) and geographical focus (Africa). The selection process resulted in sixteen peer reviewed articles which were used to review dog demography and dog ownership status, and dog rabies vaccination coverage throughout Africa. The main review findings indicate that 1) the majority (up to 98.1%) of dogs in African countries are owned (and as such accessible), 2) puppies younger than 3 months of age constitute a considerable proportion (up to 30%) of the dog population and 3) male dogs are dominating in numbers (up to 3.6 times the female dog population). Dog rabies parenteral vaccination coverage was compared between ""free of charge"" and ""owner charged"" vaccination schemes by the technique of Meta-analysis. Results indicate that the rabies vaccination coverage following a free of charge vaccination scheme (68%) is closer to the World Health Organization recommended coverage rate (70%) than the achieved coverage rate in owner-charged dog rabies vaccination schemes (18%). Conclusions/Significance Most dogs in Africa are owned and accessible for parenteral vaccination against rabies if the campaign is performed ""free of charge"".","[Jibat, Tariku; Hogeveen, Henk; Mourits, Monique C.

We estimated the prevalence of T. whipplei carriage in feces of children in Lao PDR (Laos). Methods/Principal Findings Using specific quantitative real-time PCR, followed by genotyping for each positive specimen, we estimated the prevalence of T. whipplei in 113 feces from 106 children in Vientiane, the Lao PDR (Laos). T. whipplei was detected in 48% (51/106) of children. Those aged <= 4 years were significantly less frequently positive (17/52, 33%) than older children (34/54, 63%; p< 0.001). Positive samples were genotyped. Eight genotypes were detected including 7 specific to Laos. Genotype 2, previously detected in Europe, was circulating (21% of positive children) in 2 kindergartens (Chompet and Akad). Genotypes 136 and 138 were specific to Chompet (21% and 15.8%, respectively) whereas genotype 139 was specific to Akad (10.55%). Conclusions/Significance T. whipplei is a widely distributed bacterium, highly prevalent in feces of healthy children in Laos. Further research is needed to identify the public health significance of this finding.","[Keita, Alpha Kabinet; Raoult, Didier; Fenollar, Florence] Aix Marseille Univ, CNRS 7278, UM63, URMITE,IRD 198,Inserm 1095, Marseille, France; [Dubot-Peres, Audrey] Med Univ, Aix Marseille Univ IRD EHESP, UMR D 190, Marseille, France; [Dubot-Peres, Audrey; Phommasone, Koukeo; Sibounheuang, Bountoy; Vongsouvath, Manivanh; Mayxay, Mayfong; Newton, Paul N.] Mahosot Hosp, Microbiol Lab, Lao Oxford Mahosot Hosp Wellcome Trust Res Unit L, Viangchan, Laos; [Dubot-Peres, Audrey; Mayxay, Mayfong; Newton, Paul N.] Univ Oxford, Nuffield Dept Clin Med, Churchill Hosp, Ctr Trop Med, Oxford, England","Keita, AK (reprint author), Aix Marseille Univ, CNRS 7278, UM63, URMITE,IRD 198,Inserm 1095, Marseille, France.",florence.fenollar@univ-amu.fr,"Keita, Alpha/A-9454-2015","Keita, Alpha/0000-0003-4377-341X; raoult, didier/0000-0002-0633-5974",Agence National de Recherche grant (MALEMAF); Institut Hospitalo-Universitaire Mediterranee Infection; Wellcome Trust of Great Britain,"We thank the Agence National de Recherche grant 2010 (MALEMAF) and the Institut Hospitalo-Universitaire Mediterranee Infection for their financial support in France.

Achieving these goals requires future dengue prevention strategies that will employ both potential vaccines and sustainable vector-control measures. Maternally transferred dengue antibody is an important factor in determining the optimal age for dengue vaccination. Objectives To estimate the seroprevalence of dengue antibodies among mothers living in an area of high endemicity - Ban Pong, Ratchaburi Province -and to assess maternal dengue antibodies transferred to cord blood. Materials & Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted with 141 pregnant women who delivered at Ban Pong Hospital, Ratchaburi, Thailand. Maternal-cord paired sera were tested for dengue neutralizing (NT) antibody by PRNT50 assay. A ratio of >= 1:10 NT titer to dengue serotype was considered seropositive. Results Most mothers (137/141, 97.2%) had NT antibodies to at least one dengue serotype in their sera. At birth, the proportion of cord sera with NT antibodies to DEN-1, DEN-2, DEN-3, and DEN-4, were high and similar to the sera of their mothers, at 93.6%, 97.2%, 97.9%, and 92.2%, respectively. The dengue geometric mean titers (GMT) in cord blood were significantly higher than the maternal antibodies (p<0.001): highest in DEN-2, followed by DEN-3, and then DEN-1. The GMT of DEN-4 was the lowest among all four serotypes. Conclusions Dengue infection is highly prevalent among pregnant women in this dengue-endemic area. Most of the cord blood had transferred dengue antibodies, which may have an impact on the disease burden in this population.","[Khamim, Kriangsak] Ban Pong Hosp, Dept Obstet & Gynecol, Ratchaburi, Thailand; [Hattasingh, Weerawan; Pengsaa, Krisana] Mahidol Univ, Fac Trop Med, Dept Trop Pediat, Bangkok, Thailand; [Nisalak, Ananda; Fernandez, Stefan; Thaisomboonsuk, Butsaya] Armed Forces Res Inst Med Sci AFRIMS, Dept Virol, Bangkok, Thailand; [Kaewkungwal, Jaranit] Mahidol Univ, Fac Trop Med, Ctr Excellence Biomed & Publ Hlth Informat BIOPHI, Bangkok, Thailand; [Kaewkungwal, Jaranit] Mahidol Univ, Fac Trop Med, Dept Trop Hyg, Bangkok, Thailand; [Thisyakorn, Usa] Chulalongkorn Univ, Fac Med, Dept Pediat, Bangkok 10330, Thailand","Khamim, K (reprint author), Ban Pong Hosp, Dept Obstet & Gynecol, Ratchaburi, Thailand.",Weerawan.hat@mahidol.ac.th,"amsalu, ribka/G-8780-2019","Kaewkungwal, Jaranit/0000-0001-7916-8460",,,,28,9,9,1,6,PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE,SAN FRANCISCO,"1160 BATTERY STREET, STE 100, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94111 USA",1935-2735,,,PLOS NEGLECT TROP D,Plos Neglect.

The objectives of this study were to measure the seroprevalence of CHIKV and ONNV in coastal Kenya and link it to demographics and other risk factors. Methodology Demographic and exposure questionnaires were administered to 1,848 participants recruited from two village clusters (Milalani-Nganja and Vuga) in 2009. Sera were tested for alphavirus exposure using standardized CHIKV IgG ELISA protocols and confirmed with plaque reduction neutralization tests (PRNT). Logistic regression models were used to determine the variables associated with seropositivity. Weighted K test for global clustering of houses with alphavirus positive participants was performed for distance ranges of 50-1,000 meters, and G* statistic and kernel density mapping were used to identify locations of higher seroprevalence. Principal Findings 486 (26%) participants were seropositive by IgG ELISA. Of 443 PRNT confirmed positives, 25 samples (6%) were CHIKV+, 250 samples (56%) were ONNV+, and 168 samples (38%) had high titers for both. Age was significantly associated with seropositivity (OR 1.01 per year, 95% C.I. 1.00-1.01); however, younger adults were more likely to be seropositive than older adults. Males were less likely to be seropositive (p<0.05; OR 0.79, 95% C.I. 0.64-0.97). Adults who owned a bicycle (p<0.05; OR 1.37, 95% C.I. 1.00-1.85) or motor vehicle (p<0.05; OR 4.64, 95% C.I. 1.19-18.05) were more likely to be seropositive. Spatial analysis demonstrated hotspots of transmission within each village and clustering among local households in Milalani-Nganja, peaking at the 200-00m range. Conclusions/Significance Alphavirus exposure, particularly ONNV exposure, is common in coastal Kenya with ongoing interepidemic transmission of both ONNV and CHIKV. Women and adults were more likely to be seropositive. Household location may be a defining factor for the ecology of alphaviral transmission in this region.","[LaBeaud, A.

The different clinical forms of leishmaniasis are caused by more than twenty species of Leishmania that are transmitted by nearly thirty species of phlebotomine sand flies. Pentavalent antimonials (such as Pentostam or Glucantime) are the first line drugs for treating leishmaniasis. Recent studies suggest that pentavalent antimony (Sb(V)) acts as a pro-drug, which is converted to the more active trivalent form (Sb(III)). However, sensitivity to trivalent antimony varies among different Leishmania species. In general, Leishmania species causing cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) are more sensitive to Sb(III) than the species responsible for visceral leishmaniasis (VL). Leishmania aquaglyceroporin (AQP1) facilitates the adventitious passage of antimonite down a concentration gradient. In this study, we show that Leishmania species causing CL accumulate more antimonite, and therefore exhibit higher sensitivity to antimonials, than the species responsible for VL. This species-specific differential sensitivity to antimonite is directly proportional to the expression levels of AQP1 mRNA. We show that the stability of AQP1 mRNA in different Leishmania species is regulated by their respective 3'-untranslated regions. The differential regulation of AQP1 mRNA explains the distinct antimonial sensitivity of each species.","[Mandal, Goutam; Mandal, Srotoswati; Sharma, Mansi; Bhattacharjee, Hiranmoy; Mukhopadhyay, Rita] Florida Int Univ, Herbert Wertheim Coll Med, Dept Cellular Biol & Pharmacol, Miami, FL 33199 USA; [Charret, Karen Santos; Papadopoulou, Barbara] CHU Quebec, Res Ctr, Quebec City, PQ, Canada; [Charret, Karen Santos; Papadopoulou, Barbara] Univ Laval, Dept Microbiol Infect Dis & Immunol, Quebec City, PQ, Canada","Mandal, G (reprint author), Florida Int Univ, Herbert Wertheim Coll Med, Dept Cellular Biol & Pharmacol, Miami, FL 33199 USA.",rmukhop@fiu.edu,,,Florida International University Herbert Wertheim College of Medicine Start-up fund; Florida International University Herbert Wertheim College of Medicine pilot fund,"The study was funded by a Florida International University Herbert Wertheim College of Medicine Start-up fund to RM and a Florida International University Herbert Wertheim College of Medicine pilot fund to GM.

Its importance to public health relies on its high fatality rate in non-treated cases, the socioeconomic impact related to its morbidity, and its endemicity on different continents. The estimated burden of disease of VL varies from 1,969,000 to 2,357,000 Disability Adjusted Life Years (DALYs). VL is classified as a Neglected Tropical Disease (NTD), and is strongly related to poverty and its consequences. Visceral leishmaniasis calls for the development of cost-effective technologies for diagnosis and treatment. Objective The main objective of this study was to identify, describe, classify and analyze the scientific health economic evidence of VL-related technologies. Methods A web search of combinations of free text and Mesh terms related to the economic evaluation of visceral leishmaniasis was conducted on scientific publication databases (Web of Science, Scopus, Medline via the Pubmed and Lilacs). A manual search of references lists of articles previously identified by the authors was also included. Articles written in English, Portuguese, Spanish or French were considered suitable for inclusion. Articles that matched the inclusion criteria were screened by at least two researchers, who extracted information regarding the epidemiologic scenario and methodological issues on a standardized form. Results The initial search retrieved 107 articles, whose abstracts were inspected according to the inclusion criteria leading to a first selection of 49 (46%) articles. After the elimination of duplicates, the list was reduced to 21 (20%) articles. After careful reading and application of exclusion criteria, 14 papers were eligible according to the description, classification and analysis process proposed by the study. When classified by type of economic evaluation, articles were 7 (50%) cost-effectiveness, 5 (36%) cost-minimization, 1(7%) cost-benefit, and 1(7%) budget impact. When classified by methodology, studies were mainly nested to clinical-trials (""piggy back"") 8(57%). Discount rates for outcomes and costs were present in 3 (43%) of the cost-effectiveness studies, and according to WHO's recommendations, the discount rate of 3% was used in all studies. Conclusions This article showed that health economic evaluations on visceral leishmaniasis used a wide range of technologies and methods. Nevertheless it is important to point out the geographic concentration of studies, which makes their transferability uncertain to different epidemiological scenarios, especially those concerning visceral leishmaniasis caused by Leishmania infantum.","[Marinho, Daniel S.; Casas, Carmen N.

To address the need to expand the toolbox available for the control and prevention of vector-borne diseases we embarked on the construction of specific ontologies. We present here IDODEN, an ontology that describes dengue fever, one of the globally most important diseases that are transmitted by mosquitoes. Methodology/Principal Findings We constructed IDODEN using open source software, and modeled it on IDOMAL, the malaria ontology developed previously. IDODEN covers all aspects of dengue fever, such as disease biology, epidemiology and clinical features. Moreover, it covers all facets of dengue entomology. IDODEN, which is freely available, can now be used for the annotation of dengue-related data and, in addition to its use for modeling, it can be utilized for the construction of other dedicated IT tools such as decision support systems. Conclusions/Significance The availability of the dengue ontology will enable databases hosting dengue-associated data and decision-support systems for that disease to perform most efficiently and to link their own data to those stored in other independent repositories, in an architecture-and software-independent manner.","[Mitraka, Elvira; Topalis, Pantelis; Dialynas, Emmanuel; Louis, Christos] FORTH, Inst Mol Biol & Biotechnol, Iraklion, Greece; [Mitraka, Elvira; Louis, Christos] Univ Crete, Dept Biol, Iraklion, Greece; [Dritsou, Vicky; Louis, Christos] Univ Perugia, Ctr Funct Genom, I-06100 Perugia, Italy","Mitraka, E (reprint author), FORTH, Inst Mol Biol & Biotechnol, Iraklion, Greece.",louis@imbb.forth.gr,,"Mitraka, Elvira/0000-0003-0719-3485","National Institutes of Health/National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases [HHSN266200400039C, HHSN272200900039C]; FP7 (HEALTH) programme of the European Commission [223736, 201588]; Polo d'Innovazione di Genetica Genomica e Biologia, Perugia; funds of FORTH-IMBB; University of Crete","This work was supported by the National Institutes of Health/National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases (grant numbers HHSN266200400039C, HHSN272200900039C) in the frame of the VectorBase project and was also partially supported by grants 223736 (Transmalariabloc) and 201588 (Evimalar) of the FP7 (HEALTH) programme of the European Commission.

Sandflies inject saliva while feeding and the salivary protein PpSP32 was previously shown to be a biomarker for bite exposure. Here we used recombinant PpSP32 to evaluate human exposure to Ph. papatasi bites, and study the association between antibody response to saliva and CL in endemic areas in Saudi Arabia. Methodology/Principal Findings In this observational study, anti-PpSP32 antibodies, as indicators of exposure to sandfly bites, were measured in sera from healthy individuals and patients from endemic regions in Saudi Arabia with active and cured CL. Ph. papatasi was identified as the primary CL vector in the study area. Anti-PpSP32 antibody levels were significantly higher in CL patients presenting active infections from all geographical regions compared to CL cured and healthy individuals. Furthermore, higher anti-PpSP32 antibody levels correlated with the prevalence and type of CL lesions (nodular vs. papular) observed in patients, especially non-local construction workers. Conclusions Our findings suggest a possible correlation between the type of immunity generated by the exposure to sandfly bites and disease outcome.","[Mondragon-Shem, Karina; Al-Salem, Waleed S.; Kelly-Hope, Louise; Acosta-Serrano, Alvaro] Univ Liverpool, Liverpool Sch Trop Med, Dept Parasitol, Liverpool L3 5QA, Merseyside, England; [Al-Salem, Waleed S.; Al-Zahrani, Mohammed H.] Saudi Minist Hlth, Dept Vector Borne Dis, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia; [Kelly-Hope, Louise] Univ Liverpool, Liverpool Sch Trop Med, Ctr Neglected Trop Dis, Liverpool L3 5QA, Merseyside, England; [Abdeladhim, Maha; Valenzuela, Jesus G.] NIAID, Vector Mol Biol Sect, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; [Acosta-Serrano, Alvaro] Univ Liverpool, Liverpool Sch Trop Med, Dept Vector Biol, Liverpool L3 5QA, Merseyside, England","Mondragon-Shem, K (reprint author), Univ Liverpool, Liverpool Sch Trop Med, Dept Parasitol, Liverpool L3 5QA, Merseyside, England.",alvaro.acosta-serrano@lstmed.ac.uk,"Acosta-Serrano, Alvaro/L-5503-2015","Acosta-Serrano, Alvaro/0000-0002-2576-7959; Mondragon-Shem, Karina/0000-0002-0997-5600","Ministry of Health of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia; Colombian Department of Science, Technology and Innovation (Colciencias) through the scholarship programme ""Francisco Jose de Caldas""; Intramural Research Program of the National Institutes of Health, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases","This work was supported in part by a Ph.D. studentship from the Ministry of Health of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (to WSAS); by the Colombian Department of Science, Technology and Innovation (Colciencias) through the scholarship programme ""Francisco Jose de Caldas"" (to KMS); and in part by the Intramural Research Program of the National Institutes of Health, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (to MA and JGV).

Methodology/Principal Findings Using next generation sequencing, we sequenced the genome of four independent Leishmania guyanensis antimony-resistant (SbR) mutants and found different chromosomal alterations including aneuploidy, intrachromosomal gene amplification and gene deletion. A segment covering 30 genes on chromosome 19 was amplified intrachromosomally in three of the four mutants. The gene coding for the multidrug resistance associated protein A involved in antimony resistance was also amplified in the four mutants, most likely through chromosomal translocation. All mutants also displayed a reduced accumulation of antimony mainly due to genomic alterations at the level of the subtelomeric region of chromosome 31 harboring the gene coding for the aquaglyceroporin 1 (LgAQP1). Resistance involved the loss of LgAQP1 through subtelomeric deletions in three mutants. Interestingly, the fourth mutant harbored a single G133D point mutation in LgAQP1 whose role in resistance was functionality confirmed through drug sensitivity and antimony accumulation assays. In contrast to the Leishmania subspecies that resort to extrachromosomal amplification, the Viannia strains studied here used intrachromosomal amplification and locus deletion. Conclusions/Significance This is the first report of a naturally occurred point mutation in AQP1 in antimony resistant parasites.","[Monte-Neto, Rubens; Laffitte, Marie-Claude N.; Leprohon, Philippe; Ouellette, Marc] CHU Quebec, Ctr Rech, Ctr Rech Infectiol, Quebec City, PQ, Canada; [Monte-Neto, Rubens; Laffitte, Marie-Claude N.; Leprohon, Philippe; Ouellette, Marc] Univ Laval, Fac Med, Dept Microbiol Infectiol & Immunol, Quebec City, PQ G1K 7P4, Canada; [Reis, Priscila; Frezard, Frederic] Univ Fed Minas Gerais, Inst Ciencias Biol, Dept Fisiol & Biofis, Belo Horizonte, MG, Brazil","Monte-Neto, R (reprint author), Fundacao Oswaldo Cruz, Ctr Pesquisas Rene Rachou, Lab Parasitol Celular & Mol, Belo Horizonte, MG, Brazil.",Marc.Ouellette@crchudequebec.ulaval.ca,"Frezard, Frederic/Q-7714-2019; Monte-Neto, Rubens Lima do/I-1763-2013","Frezard, Frederic/0000-0003-3783-5717; Monte-Neto, Rubens Lima do/0000-0002-4688-2462; Ouellette, Marc/0000-0002-6743-9646; Laffitte, Marie-Claude/0000-0002-9631-1801",Government of Canada - PDRF/DFAIT; Universite Laval; Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPq); Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Minas Gerais - FAPEMIG - Brazil; Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR) [13233],"RMN received postdoctoral fellowship by Government of Canada - PDRF/DFAIT.

The chronic infection in immunocompetent patients, usually considered as asymptomatic, is now suspected to be a risk factor for various neurological disorders, including epilepsy. We aimed to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of the available literature to estimate the risk of epilepsy due to toxoplasmosis. Methods A systematic literature search was conducted of several databases and journals to identify studies published in English or French, without date restriction, which looked at toxoplasmosis (as exposure) and epilepsy (as disease) and met certain other inclusion criteria. The search was based on keywords and suitable combinations in English and French. Fixed and random effects models were used to determine odds ratios, and statistical significance was set at 5.0%. Principal findings Six studies were identified, with an estimated total of 2888 subjects, of whom 1280 had epilepsy (477 positive for toxoplasmosis) and 1608 did not (503 positive for toxoplasmosis). The common odds ratio (calculated) by random effects model was 2.25 (95% CI 1.27-3.9), p = 0.005. Conclusions Despite the limited number of studies, and a lack of high-quality data, toxoplasmosis should continue to be regarded as an epilepsy risk factor. More and better studies are needed to determine the real impact of this parasite on the occurrence of epilepsy.","[Ngoungou, Edgard B.; Bhalla, Devender; Darde, Marie-Laure; Preux, Pierre-Marie] INSERM, UMR1094, Neuroepidemiol Trop, Limoges, France; [Ngoungou, Edgard B.; Bhalla, Devender; Darde, Marie-Laure; Preux, Pierre-Marie] Univ Limoges, CNRS FR GEIST 3503, UMR 1094, Trop Neuroepidemiol,Inst Neuroepidemiol & Trop Ne, Limoges, France; [Ngoungou, Edgard B.; Nzoghe, Amandine] Univ Sci Sante, Fac Med, Dept Epidemiol Biostat & Informat Med DEBIM EA NE, Libreville, Gabon; [Darde, Marie-Laure] CHU Limoges, Lab Parasitol Mycol, Limoges, France; [Preux, Pierre-Marie] CHU Limoges, CEBIMER, Limoges, France","Ngoungou, EB (reprint author), INSERM, UMR1094, Neuroepidemiol Trop, Limoges, France.",preux@unilim.fr,"PREUX, Pierre-Marie/B-8393-2014; Preux, Pierre-Marie/N-3538-2019","PREUX, Pierre-Marie/0000-0002-2171-2977; Preux, Pierre-Marie/0000-0002-2171-2977",BGFI-Bank Foundation - EA-NEMIT,"BGFI-Bank Foundation (www.bgfi.com) funded EA-NEMIT headed by EBN (1st author).

Computer-based approaches to assessing the motility of larger nematode stages have been developed, yet these lack the capability to detect and analyze the more subtle and important characteristics of the motion of nematodes. There is currently a need to improved methods of assessing the viability and health of parasitic worms. Methods We describe here a system that converts the motion of nematodes through a light-scattering system into an electrical waveform, and allows for reproducible, and wholly non-subjective, assessment of alterations in motion, as well as estimation of the number of nematode worms of different forms and sizes. Here we have used Brugia sp. microfilariae (L1), infective larvae (L3) and adults, together with the free-living nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. Results The motion of worms in a small (200ul) volume can be detected, with the presence of immotile worms not interfering with the readings at practical levels (up to at least 500 L1 /200ul). Alterations in the frequency of parasite movement following the application of the anti-parasitic drugs, (chloroquine and imatinib); the anti-filarial effect of the latter agent is the first demonstrated here for the first time. This system can also be used to estimate the number of parasites, and shortens the time required to estimate parasites numbers, and eliminates the need for microscopes and trained technicians to provide an estimate of microfilarial sample sizes up to 1000 parasites/ml. Alterations in the form of motion of the worms can also be depicted. Conclusions This new instrument, named a ""WiggleTron"", offers exciting opportunities to further study nematode biology and to aid drug discovery, as well as contributing to a rapid estimate of parasite numbers in various biological samples.","[Nutting, Chuck S.; Eversole, Rob R.; Blair, Kevin; Mackenzie, Charles D.] Western Michigan Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Kalamazoo, MI 49008 USA; [Blair, Kevin] Western Michigan Univ, Dept Chem, Kalamazoo, MI 49008 USA; [Specht, Sabine] Univ Hosp Bonn, Inst Med Microbiol, Bonn, Germany; [Nutman, Thomas B.; Klion, Amy D.] NIH, Parasit Dis Lab, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; [Wanji, Samuel] Inst Rech Dev, Montpellier, France; [Boussinesq, Michel] Univ Buea, Res Fdn Trop Dis & Environm, Buea, Cameroon; [Mackenzie, Charles D.] Michigan State Univ, Dept Pathobiol & Diagnost Invest, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA","Nutting, CS (reprint author), Western Michigan Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Kalamazoo, MI 49008 USA.",mackenz8@msu.edu,"Boussinesq, Michel/J-7256-2016","Boussinesq, Michel/0000-0001-6312-0681; Klion, Amy/0000-0002-4986-5326",Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation,"This work was supported The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.

Methodology/Principal Findings We evaluated immunological parameters in male C57BL/6 wild type and TLR4 deficient mice fed with a standard, low fat diet, LFD (3% fat) as control group, or a medium fat diet, MFD (14% fat) in order to induce NASH, or mice infected intraperitoneally with 100 blood-derived trypomastigotes of Tulahuen strain and also fed with LFD (I+LFD) or MFD (I+MFD) for 24 weeks. We demonstrated that MFD by itself was able to induce NASH in WT mice and that parasitic infection induced marked metabolic changes with reduction of body weight and steatosis revealed by histological studies. The I+MFD group also improved insulin resistance, demonstrated by homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) analysis; although parasitic infection increased the triglycerides and cholesterol plasma levels. In addition, hepatic M1 inflammatory macrophages and cytotoxic T cells showed intracellular inflammatory cytokines which were associated with high levels of IL6, IFN gamma and IL17 plasmatic cytokines and CCL2 chemokine. These findings correlated with an increase in hepatic parasite load in I+MFD group demonstrated by qPCR assays. The recruitment of hepatic B lymphocytes, NK and dendritic cells was enhanced by MFD, and it was intensified by parasitic infection. These results were TLR4 signaling dependent. Flow cytometry and confocal microscopy analysis demonstrated that the reactive oxygen species and peroxinitrites produced by liver inflammatory leukocytes of MFD group were also exacerbated by parasitic infection in our NASH model. Conclusions We highlight that a medium fat diet by itself is able to induce steatohepatitis. Our results also suggest a synergic effect between damage associated with molecular patterns generated during NASH and parasitic infection, revealing an intense cross-talk between metabolically active tissues, such as the liver, and the immune system. Thus, T. cruzi infection must be considered as an additional risk factor since exacerbates the inflammation and accelerates the development of hepatic injury.","[Onofrio, Luisina I.; Arocena, Alfredo R.; Paroli, Augusto F.; Cano, Roxana C.; Gea, Susana] Univ Nacl Cordoba, Fac Ciencias Quim, Ctr Invest Bioquim Clin & Inmunol CIBICI CONICET, RA-5000 Cordoba, Argentina; [Cabalen, Maria E.; Andrada, Marta C.; Cano, Roxana C.] Univ Catolica Cordoba, Fac Ciencias Quim, UA Area CS AGR ING BIO Y S CONICET, Cordoba, Argentina","Onofrio, LI (reprint author), Univ Nacl Cordoba, Fac Ciencias Quim, Ctr Invest Bioquim Clin & Inmunol CIBICI CONICET, RA-5000 Cordoba, Argentina.",lonofrio@fcq.unc.edu.ar; sgea@fcq.unc.edu.ar,,,"Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas (CONICET) [PIP 2010-R16519]; Secretaria de Ciencia y Tecnica de la Universidad Nacional de Cordoba (SECYT-UNC), Cordoba, Argentina; Agencia Nacional de Promocion Cientifica y Tecnologica [ANPCYT-PICT 2010-1696]","This work was supported by grants from the Agencia Nacional de Promocion Cientifica y Tecnologica (ANPCYT-PICT 2010-1696); Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas (CONICET) PIP 2010-R16519 and Secretaria de Ciencia y Tecnica de la Universidad Nacional de Cordoba (SECYT-UNC) 2012, Cordoba, Argentina.",,64,7,7,0,9,PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE,SAN FRANCISCO,"1160 BATTERY STREET, STE 100, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94111 USA",1935-2735,,,PLOS NEGLECT TROP D,Plos Neglect.

Envenomation by snakes belonging to the genus Bitis, Viperidae family, are common in Sub-Saharan Africa. The accidents are severe and the victims often have a poor prognosis due to the lack of effective specific therapies. In this study we have biochemically characterized venoms from three different species of Bitis, i.e., Bitis arietans, Bitis gabonica rhinoceros and Bitis nasicornis, involved in the majority of the human accidents in Africa, and analyzed the in vitro neutralizing ability of two experimental antivenoms. Methodology/Principal Findings The data indicate that all venoms presented phospholipase, hyaluronidase and fibrinogenolytic activities and cleaved efficiently the FRET substrate Abz-RPPGFSPFRQ-EDDnp and angiotensin I, generating angiotensin 1-7. Gelatinolytic activity was only observed in the venoms of B. arietans and B. nasicornis. The treatment of the venoms with protease inhibitors indicated that Bitis venoms possess metallo and serinoproteases enzymes, which may be involved in the different biological activities here evaluated. Experimental antivenoms produced against B. arietans venom or Bitis g. rhinoceros plus B. nasicornis venoms cross-reacted with the venoms from the three species and blocked, in different degrees, all the enzymatic activities in which they were tested. Conclusion These results suggest that the venoms of the three Bitis species, involved in accidents with humans in the Sub-Saharan Africa, contain a mixture of various enzymes that may act in the generation and development of some of the clinical manifestations of the envenomations. We also demonstrated that horse antivenoms produced against B. arietans or B. g. rhinoceros plus B. nasicornis venoms can blocked some of the toxic activities of these venoms.","[Paixao-Cavalcante, Danielle; Kuniyoshi, Alexandre K.; Portaro, Fernanda C.

However, there is little understanding of how resistance arises and spreads or of the ""genetic signature"" of selection for this group of important pathogens. We have investigated these questions in the system for which anthelmintic resistance is most advanced; benzimidazole resistance in the sheep parasites Haemonchus contortus and Teladorsagia circumcincta. Population genetic analysis with neutral microsatellite markers reveals that T. circumcincta has higher genetic diversity but lower genetic differentiation between farms than H. contortus in the UK. We propose that this is due to epidemiological differences between the two parasites resulting in greater seasonal bottlenecking of H. contortus. There is a remarkably high level of resistance haplotype diversity in both parasites compared with drug resistance studies in other eukaryotic systems. Our analysis suggests a minimum of four independent origins of resistance mutations on just seven farms for H. contortus, and even more for T. circumincta. Both hard and soft selective sweeps have occurred with striking differences between individual farms. The sweeps are generally softer for T. circumcincta than H. contortus, consistent with its higher level of genetic diversity and consequent greater availability of new mutations. We propose a model in which multiple independent resistance mutations recurrently arise and spread by migration to explain the widespread occurrence of resistance in these parasites. Finally, in spite of the complex haplotypic diversity, we show that selection can be detected at the target locus using simple measures of genetic diversity and departures from neutrality. This work has important implications for the application of genome-wide approaches to identify new anthelmintic resistance loci and the likelihood of anthelmintic resistance emerging as selection pressure is increased in human soil-transmitted nematodes by community wide treatment programs.","[Redman, Elizabeth; Gilleard, John Stuart] Univ Calgary, Fac Vet Med, Dept Comparat Biol & Expt Med, Calgary, AB, Canada; [Whitelaw, Fiona; Tait, Andrew] Univ Glasgow, Sch Vet Med, Coll Med Vet & Life Sci, Glasgow, Lanark, Scotland; [Burgess, Charlotte; Bartley, Yvonne; Skuce, Philip John; Jackson, Frank] Moredun Res Inst, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland","Redman, E (reprint author), Univ Calgary, Fac Vet Med, Dept Comparat Biol & Expt Med, Calgary, AB, Canada.",jsgillea@ucalgary.ca,,"Gilleard, John/0000-0002-6787-4699",Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC) [RGPIN/371529-2209]; NSERC-CREATE Host Pathogen Interactions (HPI) graduate training program at the University of Calgary; Moredun money; Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBRSC) Combating Endemic Diseases Grant [BB/E018505/1]; Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council [BB/E018505/1],"The authors would like to thank the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC) for funding support (Grant number RGPIN/371529-2209) as well as the NSERC-CREATE Host Pathogen Interactions (HPI) graduate training program at the University of Calgary.

Miltefosine is under evaluation for the treatment of cutaneous leishmaniasis in the Americas although its efficacy for the treatment of human visceral leishmaniasis caused by Leishmania infantum chagasi has not been described. Drug efficacy for visceral leishmaniasis is ideally tested in hamsters, an experimental model that mimics human disease. Luciferase has been validated as a quantitative tool for the determination of parasite burden in experimental leishmaniasis. However, there are no reports of luciferase detection in the model of progressive visceral leishmaniasis in hamsters. Therefore, the aims of this study were to generate recombinant Leishmania infantum chagasi expressing the luciferase gene (Lc-LUC), characterize the biological properties of this transgenic line as compared with the wild-type parasites and evaluate miltefosine effectiveness in Lc-LUC infected hamsters. Methodology/Principal Findings A transgenic line containing a luciferase encoding gene integrated into the ribosomal DNA locus was obtained and shown to produce bioluminescence which correlated with the number of parasites. Lc-LUC growth curves and susceptibility to pentavalent antimony and miltefosine in vitro were indistinguishable from the wild-type parasites. The effectiveness of pentavalent antimony was evaluated in Lc-LUC infected hamsters through bioimaging and determination of Leishman Donovan Units. Both methods showed concordant results. Miltefosine was effective in the treatment of Lc-LUC-infected hamsters, as demonstrated by the reduction in parasite burden in a dose-dependent manner and by prolongation of animal survival. Conclusions/Significance Luciferase expressing parasites are a reliable alternative for parasite burden quantification in hamsters with advantages such as the possibility of estimating parasite load before drug treatment and therefore allowing distribution of animals in groups with equivalent mean parasite burden. Miltefosine was effective in vivo in an L. infantum chagasi experimental model of infection.","[Reimao, Juliana Q.; Oliveira, Jordana C.; Trinconi, Cristiana T.; Coelho, Adriano C.; Uliana, Silvia R.

One of this class of drugs, tribendimidine (a symmetrical diamidine derivative, of amidantel), was developed in China for use in humans in the mid-1980s. It has a broader-spectrum anthelmintic action against soil-transmitted helminthiasis than other cholinergic anthelmintics, and is effective against hookworm, pinworms, roundworms, and Strongyloides and flatworm of humans. Although molecular studies on C. elegans suggest that tribendimidine is a cholinergic agonist that is selective for the same nematode muscle nAChR as levamisole, no direct electrophysiological observations in nematode parasites have been made to test this hypothesis. Also the hypothesis that levamisole and tribendimine act on the same receptor, does not explain why tribendimidine is effective against some nematode parasites when levamisole is not. Here we examine the effects of tribendimidine on the electrophysiology and contraction of Ascaris suum body muscle and show that tribendimidine produces depolarization antagonized by the nicotinic antagonist mecamylamine, and that tribendimidine is an agonist of muscle nAChRs of parasitic nematodes. Further pharmacological characterization of the nAChRs activated by tribendimidine in our Ascaris muscle contraction assay shows that tribendimidine is not selective for the same receptor subtypes as levamisole, and that tribendimidine is more selective for the B-subtype than the L-subtype of nAChR. In addition, larval migration inhibition assays with levamisole-resistant Oesophagostomum dentatum isolates show that tribendimidine is as active on a levamisole-resistant isolate as on a levamisole-sensitive isolate, suggesting that the selectivity for levamisole and tribendimidine is not the same. It is concluded that tribendimidine can activate a different population of nematode parasite nAChRs than levamisole, and is more like bephenium. The different nAChR subtype selectivity of tribendimidine may explain why the spectrum of action of tribendimidine is different to that of other cholinergic anthelmintics like levamisole.","[Robertson, Alan P.; Puttachary, Sreekanth; Buxton, Samuel K.; Martin, Richard J.] Iowa State Univ, Dept Biomed Sci, Ames, IA 50011 USA","Robertson, AP (reprint author), Iowa State Univ, Dept Biomed Sci, Ames, IA 50011 USA.",rjmartin@iastate.edu,"Puttachary, Sreekanth/S-3639-2019","Puttachary, Sreekanth/0000-0002-4071-7896; Buxton, Samuel/0000-0001-8796-9284",National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIH) [R 01 A1 047194],"The research project culminating in this paper was funded by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIH) grant R 01 A1 047194 to RJM.

Arrhythmias have been related to sudden death, even in asymptomatic patients, and their molecular mechanisms have not been fully elucidated. Objective The aim of this study is to demonstrate the effect of proteins secreted by T. cruzi on healthy, isolated beating rat heart model under a non-damage-inducing protocol. Methods and Results We established a non-damage-inducing recirculation-reoxygenation model where ultrafiltrate fractions of conditioned medium control or conditioned infected medium were perfused at a standard flow rate and under partial oxygenation. Western blotting with chagasic patient serum was performed to determine the antigenicity of the conditioned infected medium fractions. We observed bradycardia, ventricular fibrillation and complete atrioventricular block in hearts during perfusion with >50 kDa conditioned infected culture medium. The preincubation of conditioned infected medium with chagasic serum abolished the bradycardia and arrhythmias. The proteins present in the conditioned infected culture medium of >50 kDa fractions were recognized by the chagasic patient sera associated with arrhythmias. Conclusions These results suggest that proteins secreted by T. cruzi are involved in Chagas disease arrhythmias and may be a potential biomarker in chagasic patients.","[Rodriguez-Angulo, Hector O.; Mijares, Alfredo] Inst Venezolano Invest Cient, Ctr Biofis & Bioquim, Lab Fisiol Parasitos, Caracas, Venezuela; [Toro-Mendoza, Jhoan] Inst Venezolano Invest Cient, Ctr Estudios Interdisciplinarios Fis, Caracas, Venezuela; [Marques, Juan A.] Cent Univ Venezuela, Inst Med Trop, Serv Cardiol, Caracas, Venezuela; [Concepcion, Juan L.] Univ Los Andes, Fac Ciencias, Dept Biol, Lab Enzimol Parasitos, Merida 5101, Venezuela; [Bonfante-Cabarcas, Rafael] Univ Ctr Occidental Lisandro Alvarado, Ciencias Salud, Unidad Invest Bioquim, Barquisimeto, Venezuela; [Higuerey, Yoliver] Inst Venezolano Invest Cient, Ctr Biofis & Bioquim, Serv Cult Celulas & Tejidos, Caracas, Venezuela; [Thomas, Luz E.] Inst Venezolano Invest Cient, Ctr Biofis & Bioquim, Lab Fisiol Mol, Caracas, Venezuela; [Balzano-Nogueira, Leandro] Inst Estudios Avanzados IDEA, Unidad Agron & Soberania Agroalimentaria, Caracas, Venezuela; [Lopez, Jose R.] Univ Calif Davis, Sch Vet Med, Dept Mol Biosci, Davis, CA 95616 USA","Rodriguez-Angulo, HO (reprint author), Inst Venezolano Invest Cient, Ctr Biofis & Bioquim, Lab Fisiol Parasitos, Caracas, Venezuela.",amijares@ivic.gob.ve,"Thomas, Luz E/A-7308-2010","Thomas, Luz/0000-0003-3825-0569; Toro-Mendoza, Jhoan/0000-0003-4916-7445; Rodriguez, Hector/0000-0001-9002-103X",Instituto Venezolano de Investigaciones Cientificas [305],"The authors received funding for this work from the Instituto Venezolano de Investigaciones Cientificas, project No. 305.

It is transmitted to humans via the tsetse fly. Approximately 70 million people worldwide were at risk of infection in 1995, and approximately 20,000 people across Africa are infected with HAT. The objective of this review was to identify existing economic evaluations in order to summarise cost-effective interventions to reduce, control, or eliminate the burden of HAT. The studies included in the review were compared and critically appraised in order to determine if there were existing standardised methods that could be used for economic evaluation of HAT interventions or if innovative methodological approaches are warranted. A search strategy was developed using keywords and was implemented in January 2014 in several databases. The search returned a total of 2,283 articles. After two levels of screening, a total of seven economic evaluations were included and underwent critical appraisal using the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN) Methodology Checklist 6: Economic Evaluations. Results from the existing studies focused on the cost-effectiveness of interventions for the control and reduction of disease transmission. Modelling was a common method to forecast long-term results, and publications focused on interventions by category, such as case detection, diagnostics, drug treatments, and vector control. Most interventions were considered cost-effective based on the thresholds described; however, the current treatment, nifurto-mix-eflornithine combination therapy (NECT), has not been evaluated for cost-effectiveness, and considerations for cost-effective strategies for elimination have yet to be completed. Overall, the current evidence highlights the main components that play a role in control; however, economic evaluations of HAT elimination strategies are needed to assist national decision makers, stakeholders, and key funders. These analyses would be of use, as HAT is currently being prioritized as a neglected tropical disease (NTD) to reach elimination by 2020.","[Sutherland, C.

Leishmania amazonensis is an important agent in Brazil, leading to clinical forms varying from localized (LCL) to diffuse cutaneous leishmaniasis (DCL). One interesting issue rarely analyzed is how host immune response affects Leishmania phenotype and virulence. Aiming to study the effect of host immune system on Leishmania proteins we compared proteomes of amastigotes isolated from BALB/c and BALB/c nude mice. The athymic nude mice may resemble patients with diffuse cutaneous leishmaniasis, considered T-cell hyposensitive or anergic to Leishmania's antigens. This work is the first to compare modifications in amastigotes' proteomes driven by host immune response. Among the 44 differentially expressed spots, there were proteins related to oxidative/nitrosative stress and proteases. Some correspond to known Leishmania virulence factors such as OPB and tryparedoxin peroxidase. Specific isoforms of these two proteins were increased in parasites from nude mice, suggesting that T cells probably restrain their posttranslational modifications in BALB/c mice. On the other hand, an isoform of HSP70 was increased in amastigotes from BALB/c mice. We believe our study may allow identification of potential virulence factors and ways of regulating their expression.","[Teixeira, Priscila Camillo; Cunha-Neto, Edecio] Univ Sao Paulo, Sch Med, Heart Inst InCor, Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil; [Velasquez, Leonardo Garcia; de Rezende, Eloiza; Stolf, Beatriz Simonsen] Univ Sao Paulo, Inst Biomed Sci, Dept Parasitol, Sao Paulo, Brazil; [Lepique, Ana Paula] Univ Sao Paulo, Inst Biomed Sci, Dept Immunol, Sao Paulo, Brazil; [Camargo Bonatto, Jose Matheus] Univ Sao Paulo, Inst Chem, Dept Biochem, Sao Paulo, Brazil; [Barcinski, Marcello Andre] Oswaldo Cruz Inst FioCruz, Rio De Janeiro, Brazil","Teixeira, PC (reprint author), Univ Sao Paulo, Sch Med, Heart Inst InCor, Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil.",bstolf@usp.br,"Lepique, Ana Paula/D-5878-2013; Cunha-Neto, Edecio/B-4157-2009; Stolf, Beatriz S/H-7943-2012","Lepique, Ana Paula/0000-0002-4707-2912; Cunha-Neto, Edecio/0000-0002-3699-3345; Stolf, Beatriz S/0000-0001-7661-3311",FAPESP (Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo); CNPq (Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico),"Financial support was obtained mainly from FAPESP (Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo- http://www.fapesp.br/) and also from CNPq (Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico- http://www.cnpq.br).

These can take months to indicate cure and, as a result, syphilis treatment trials require long periods of follow-up. The causative organism, Treponema pallidum (T. pallidum), is detectable in the infectious lesions of early syphilis using DNA amplification. Bacteraemia can likewise be identified, typically in more active disease. We hypothesise that bacterial clearance from blood and ulcers will predict early the standard serology-measured treatment response and have developed a qPCR assay that could monitor this clearance directly in patients with infectious syphilis. Patients with early syphilis were given an intramuscular dose of benzathine penicillin. To investigate the appropriate sampling timeframe samples of blood and ulcer exudate were collected intensively for T. pallidum DNA (tpp047 gene) and RNA (16S rRNA) quantification. Sampling ended when two consecutive PCRs were negative. Four males were recruited. The mean peak level of T. pallidum DNA was 1626 copies/ml whole blood and the mean clearance half-life was 5.7 hours (std. dev. 0.53). The mean peak of 16S rRNA was 8879 copies/ml whole blood with a clearance half-life of 3.9 hours (std. dev. 0.84). From an ulcer, pre-treatment, 67,400 T. pallidum DNA copies and 7.08x107 16S rRNA copies were detected per absorbance strip and the clearance half-lives were 3.2 and 4.1 hours, respectively. Overall, T. pallidum nucleic acids were not detected in any sample collected more than 56 hours (range 20-56) after treatment. All patients achieved serologic cure. In patients with active early syphilis, measuring T. pallidum levels in blood and ulcer exudate may be a useful measure of treatment success in therapeutic trials. These laboratory findings need confirmation on a larger scale and in patients receiving different therapies.","[Tipple, Craig; McClure, Myra; Taylor, Graham] Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Fac Med, London, England; [Jones, Rachael] Chelsea & Westminster Hosp NHS Fdn Trust, West London Ctr Sexual Hlth, London, England","Tipple, C (reprint author), Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Fac Med, London, England.",c.tipple@imperial.ac.uk,,,National Institute for Health Research; National Institute for Health Research [DRF-2010-03-141],"This article presents independent research funded by the National Institute for Health Research. http://www.nihr.ac.uk.

However, the neglect of rabies expansion and scarce analyses of the dynamics have made the spatiotemporal spread pattern of human rabies and its determinants being poorly understood. Methods We collected geographic locations and timeline of reported human rabies cases, rabies sequences and socioeconomic variables for the years 2004-2013, and integrated multidisciplinary approaches, including epidemiological characterization, hotspots identification, risk factors analysis and phylogeographic inference, to explore the spread pattern of human rabies in mainland China during the last decade. Results The results show that human rabies distribution and hotspots were expanding from southeastern regions to north or west regions, which could be associated with the evolution of the virus, especially the clade I-G. A Panel Poisson Regression analysis reveals that human rabies incidences had significant correlation with the education level, GDP per capita, temperature at one-month lag and canine rabies outbreak at two-month lag. Conclusions The reduction in the overall human rabies incidence was accompanied by a westward and northward expansion of the circulating region in mainland China. Higher risk of human rabies was associated with lower level of education and economic status. New clades of rabies, especial Clade I-G, played an important role in recent spread. Our findings provide valuable information for rabies control and prevention in the future.","[Yao, Hong-Wu; Liu, Kun; Li, Xin-Lou; Zuo, Shu-Qing; Sun, Ruo-Xi; Fang, Li-Qun; Cao, Wu-Chun] Beijing Inst Microbiol & Epidemiol, State Key Lab Pathogen & Biosecur, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Yang, Yang] Univ Florida, Dept Biostat, Gainesville, FL USA; [Yang, Yang] Univ Florida, Emerging Pathogens Inst, Gainesville, FL USA","Yao, HW (reprint author), Beijing Inst Microbiol & Epidemiol, State Key Lab Pathogen & Biosecur, Beijing, Peoples R China.",fanglq@bmi.ac.cn; caowc@bmi.ac.cn,,,Special Program for Prevention and Control of Infectious Diseases in China [2013ZX10004218]; Basic Work on Special Program for Science & Technology Research [2013FY114600]; Natural Science Foundation of China [81172728]; National Institute of General Medical Sciences MIDAS [U54-GM111274],"The study was supported by the Special Program for Prevention and Control of Infectious Diseases in China (No. 2013ZX10004218), the Basic Work on Special Program for Science & Technology Research (2013FY114600), the Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 81172728), YY was supported by the National Institute of General Medical Sciences MIDAS grant U54-GM111274.

Methodology/Principal Findings The objective of the present study was to evaluate the use of MALDI-TOF MS to identify tick species, and to determine the presence of rickettsia pathogens in the infected Ticks. Rhipicephalus sanguineus and Dermacentor marginatus Ticks infected or not by R. conorii conorii or R. slovaca, respectively, were used as experimental models. The MS profiles generated from protein extracts prepared from tick legs exhibited mass peaks that distinguished the infected and uninfected Ticks, and successfully discriminated the Rickettsia spp. A blind test was performed using Ticks that were laboratory-reared, collected in the field or removed from patients and infected or not by Rickettsia spp. A query against our in-lab arthropod MS reference database revealed that the species and infection status of all Ticks were correctly identified at the species and infection status levels. Conclusions/Significance Taken together, the present work demonstrates the utility of MALDI-TOF MS for a dual identification of tick species and intracellular bacteria. Therefore, MALDI-TOF MS is a relevant tool for the accurate detection of Rickettsia spp in Ticks for both field monitoring and entomological diagnosis. The present work offers new perspectives for the monitoring of other vector borne diseases that present public health concerns.","[Yssouf, Amina; Almeras, Lionel; Terras, Jerome; Raoult, Didier; Parola, Philippe] Aix Marseille Univ, URMITE, CNRS 7278, UM63,IRD 198, Dakar, Senegal; [Yssouf, Amina; Almeras, Lionel; Terras, Jerome; Raoult, Didier; Parola, Philippe] Fac Med, WHO Collaborat Ctr Rickettsioses & Other Arthropo, Inserm 1095, Marseille, France; [Socolovschi, Cristina] Hop St Joseph 26, Marseille, France","Yssouf, A (reprint author), Aix Marseille Univ, URMITE, CNRS 7278, UM63,IRD 198, Dakar, Senegal.",philippe.parola@univ-amu.fr,,"ALMERAS, Lionel/0000-0003-0490-5774; raoult, didier/0000-0002-0633-5974",,,,30,26,28,0,11,PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE,SAN FRANCISCO,"1160 BATTERY STREET, STE 100, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94111 USA",1935-2735,,,PLOS NEGLECT TROP D,Plos Neglect.

Since the tegument (TG) of Schistosoma japonicum is in direct contact with the host and induces a host immune response against infection, the identification of immune response target molecules in the schistosome TG is crucial for screening diagnostic antigens for this disease. Methodology/Principal Findings In this study, an immunoproteomics approach used TG proteins as screening antigens to identify potential diagnostic molecules of S. japonicum. Ten spots corresponding to six proteins were identified that immunoreacted with sera from S. japonicum-infected rabbits but not sera from uninfected rabbits and their specific IgG antibody levels declined quickly after praziquantel treatment. Recombinant phosphoglycerate mutase (PGM) and UV excision repair protein RAD23 homolog B (RAD23) proteins were expressed and their diagnostic potential for schistosomiasis was evaluated and compared with schistosome soluble egg antigen (SEA) using ELISA. The results showed high sensitivity and specificity and low crossreactivity when rSjPGM-ELISA and rSjRAD23-ELISA were used to detect water buffalo schistosomiasis. Moreover, antibodies to rSjPGM and rSjRAD23 might be short-lived since they declined quickly after chemotherapy. Conclusion/Significance Therefore, the two schistosome TG proteins SjPGM and SjRAD23 were identified as potential diagnostic markers for the disease. The two recombinant proteins might have the potential to evaluate the effectiveness of drug treatments and for distinguishing between current and past infection.","[Zhang, Min; Fu, Zhiqiang; Li, Changjian; Cao, Xiaodan; Han, Hongxiao; Liu, Yantao; Lu, Ke; Hong, Yang; Lin, Jiaojiao] Chinese Acad Agr Sci, Shanghai Vet Res Inst, Minist Agr China, Key Lab Anim Parasitol, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Min] Henan Univ Sci & Technol, Coll Anim Sci & Technol, Luoyang, Peoples R China; [Han, Yanhui] Henan Inst Sci & Technol, Coll Anim Sci, Xinxiang, Peoples R China; [Lin, Jiaojiao] Jiangsu Coinnovat Ctr Prevent & Control Important, Yangzhou, Jiangsu, Peoples R China","Zhang, M (reprint author), Chinese Acad Agr Sci, Shanghai Vet Res Inst, Minist Agr China, Key Lab Anim Parasitol, Shanghai, Peoples R China.",hongyang_7@126.com; jjlin@shvri.ac.cn,,,National Natural Science Foundation of China [31172315]; basic scientific research operation cost of state-level public welfare scientific research courtyard [2013JB18]; Agro-scientific Research in the Public Interest [200903036]; Science Technology Development Foundation of Shanghai [12140902700]; China Postdoctoral Science Foundation [2014M550909],"This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 31172315), basic scientific research operation cost of state-level public welfare scientific research courtyard (No. 2013JB18), Agro-scientific Research in the Public Interest (No. 200903036) and the Science Technology Development Foundation of Shanghai (No. 12140902700) and China Postdoctoral Science Foundation (2014M550909).

Despite a limited understanding of the pathogenesis of HFRS, the importance of the abundant production of pro-inflammatory cytokines has been widely recognized. Interleukin 33 (IL-33) has been demonstrated to play an important role in physiological and pathological immune responses. After binding to its receptor ST2L, IL-33 stimulates the Th2-type immune response and promotes cytokine production. Depending on the disease model, IL-33 either protects against infection or exacerbates inflammatory disease, but it is unknown how the IL-33/ST2 axis regulates the immune response during HTNV infection. Methodology/Principal Findings Blood samples were collected from 23 hospitalized patients and 28 healthy controls. The levels of IL-33 and soluble ST2 (sST2) in plasma were quantified by ELISA, and the relationship between IL-33, sST2 and the disease severity was analyzed. The role of IL-33/sST2 axis in the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines was studied on HTNV-infected endothelial cells. The results showed that the plasma IL-33 and sST2 were significantly higher in patients than in healthy controls. Spearman analysis showed that elevated IL-33 and sST2 levels were positively correlated with white blood cell count and viral load, while negatively correlated with platelet count. Furthermore, we found that IL-33 enhanced the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines in HTNV-infected endothelial cells through NF-kappa B pathway and that this process was inhibited by the recombinant sST2. Conclusion/Significance Our results indicate that the IL-33 acts as an initiator of the ""cytokine storm"" during HTNV infection, while sST2 can inhibit this process. Our findings could provide a promising immunotherapeutic target for the disease control.","[Zhang, Yusi; Zhang, Chunmei; Zhuang, Ran; Ma, Ying; Zhang, Yun; Yi, Jing; Yang, Angang; Jin, Boquan] Fourth Mil Med Univ, Dept Immunol, Xian 710032, Peoples R China","Zhang, YS (reprint author), Fourth Mil Med Univ, Dept Immunol, Xian 710032, Peoples R China.",immu_jin@fmmu.edu.cn,,,National Natural Science Foundation of China [30930087]; National Basic Research Program of China [2012CB518905],"This study was supported by The National Natural Science Foundation of China (no. 30930087) and the National Basic Research Program of China (no. 2012CB518905).

Thus, successful treatment could be initiated to avoid unfavorable outcome. Our aim was to compare two qPCR assays for Rickettsia detection and to evaluate their contribution in early diagnosis of rickettsial infection in Tunisian patients. Patients and methods Included patients were hospitalized in different hospitals in Tunisia from 2007 to 2012. Serology was performed by microimmunofluorescence assay using R. conorii and R. typhi antigens. Two duplex qPCRs, previously reported, were performed on collected skin biopsies and whole blood samples. The first duplex amplified all Rickettsia species (PanRick) and Rickettsia typhi DNA (Rtt). The second duplex detected spotted fever group Rickettsiae (RC00338) and typhus group Rickettsiae DNA (Rp278). Results Diagnosis of rickettsiosis was confirmed in 82 cases (57.7%). Among 44 skin biopsies obtained from patients with confirmed diagnosis, the first duplex was positive in 24 samples (54.5%), with three patients positive by Rtt qPCR. Using the second duplex, positivity was noted in 21 samples (47.7%), with two patients positive by Rp278 qPCR. Among79 whole blood samples obtained from patients with confirmed diagnosis, panRick qPCR was positive in 5 cases (6.3%) among which two were positive by Rtt qPCR. Using the second set of qPCRs, positivity was noted in four cases (5%) with one sample positive by Rp278 qPCR. Positivity rates of the two duplex qPCRs were significantly higher among patients presenting with negative first serum than those with already detectable antibodies. Conclusions Using qPCR offers a rapid diagnosis. The PanRick qPCR showed a higher sensitivity. Our study showed that this qPCR could offer a prompt diagnosis at the early stage of the disease. However, its implementation in routine needs cost/effectiveness evaluation.","[Znazen, Abir; Sellami, Hanen; Hammami, Adnene] Sfax Univ, Habib Bourguiba Univ Hosp Sfax, Microbiol Lab, Res Lab MPH, Sfax, Tunisia; [Elleuch, Emna; Ben Jemaa, Mounir] Sfax Univ, Hedi Chaker Univ Hosp Sfax, Dept Infect Dis, Sfax, Tunisia; [Hattab, Zouhour; Letaief, Amel] Farhat Hached Univ Hosp Sousse, Dept Infect Dis, Sousse, Tunisia; [Ben Sassi, Laroussi] Reg Hosp Zarzis, Dept Med, Zarzis, Tunisia; [Khrouf, Fatma] Pasteur Inst Tunis, Entomol Lab, Tunis, Tunisia; [Dammak, Hassen] Sfax Univ, Habib Bourguiba Univ Hosp Sfax, Intens Care Unit, Sfax, Tunisia","Znazen, A (reprint author), Sfax Univ, Habib Bourguiba Univ Hosp Sfax, Microbiol Lab, Res Lab MPH, Sfax, Tunisia.",abirznazen2001@yahoo.fr,,,,,,25,10,10,0,8,PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE,SAN FRANCISCO,"1160 BATTERY STREET, STE 100, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94111 USA",1935-2735,,,PLOS NEGLECT TROP D,Plos Neglect.

Previous studies have shown that wounds of BU patients are colonized with M. ulcerans and several other microorganisms, including Staphylococcus aureus, which may interfere with wound healing. The present study was therefore aimed at investigating the diversity and topography of S. aureus colonizing BU patients during treatment. Methodology We investigated the presence, diversity, and spatio-temporal distribution of S. aureus in 30 confirmed BU patients from Ghana during treatment. S. aureus was isolated from nose and wound swabs, and by replica plating of wound dressings collected bi-weekly from patients. S. aureus isolates were characterized by multiple-locus variable number tandem repeat fingerprinting (MLVF) and spa-typing, and antibiotic susceptibility was tested. Principal Findings Nineteen (63%) of the 30 BU patients tested positive for S. aureus at least once during the sampling period, yielding 407 S. aureus isolates. Detailed analysis of 91 isolates grouped these isolates into 13 MLVF clusters and 13 spa-types. Five (26%) S. aureus-positive BU patients carried the same S. aureus genotype in their anterior nares and wounds. S. aureus isolates from the wounds of seven (37%) patients were distributed over two different MLVF clusters. Wounds of three (16%) patients were colonized with isolates belonging to two different genotypes at the same time, and five (26%) patients were colonized with different S. aureus types over time. Five (17%) of the 30 included BU patients tested positive for methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA). Conclusion/Significance The present study showed that the wounds of many BU patients were contaminated with S. aureus, and that many BU patients from the different communities carried the same S. aureus genotype during treatment. This calls for improved wound care and hygiene.","[Amissah, Nana Ama; van der Werf, Tjip S.; Stienstra, Ymkje] Univ Groningen, Univ Med Ctr Groningen, Dept Internal Med, Groningen, Netherlands; [Amissah, Nana Ama; Ablordey, Anthony; Tetteh, Caitlin S.; Prah, Isaac] Univ Ghana, Noguchi Mem Inst Med Res, Dept Bacteriol, Legon, Ghana; [Glasner, Corinna; Rossen, John W.; van Dijl, Jan Maarten] Univ Groningen, Univ Med Ctr Groningen, Dept Med Microbiol, Groningen, Netherlands; [Kotey, Nana Konama] Pakro Hlth Ctr, Ghana Hlth Serv, Pakro, Ghana","Amissah, NA (reprint author), Univ Groningen, Univ Med Ctr Groningen, Dept Internal Med, Groningen, Netherlands.",j.m.van.dijl01@umcg.nl,"Rossen, John W/G-7564-2011; Stienstra, Ymkje/F-2222-2010","Rossen, John W/0000-0002-7167-8623; Stienstra, Ymkje/0000-0002-8844-8859; van der Werf, Tjip/0000-0002-4824-1642",Graduate School for Medical Sciences of the University of Groningen; Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research; European Foundation Initiative for Neglected Tropical disease; Gratama foundation,"NAA and CG were supported by fellowships from the Graduate School for Medical Sciences of the University of Groningen.

Adult Onchocerca volvulus and Brugia malayi worms (macrofilariae) can live for up to 15 years, reproducing and allowing the infection to persist in a population. Therefore, to support control or elimination of these two diseases, effective macrofilaricidal drugs are necessary, in addition to current drugs. In an effort to identify macrofilaricidal drugs, we screened an FDA-approved library with adult worms of Brugia spp. and Onchocerca ochengi, third-stage larvae (L3s) of Onchocerca volvulus, and the microfilariae of both O. ochengi and Loa loa. We found that auranofin, a gold-containing drug used for rheumatoid arthritis, was effective in vitro in killing both Brugia spp. and O. ochengi adult worms and in inhibiting the molting of L3s of O. volvulus with IC50 values in the low micromolar to nanomolar range. Auranofin had an approximately 43-fold higher IC50 against the microfilariae of L. loa compared with the IC50 for adult female O. ochengi, which may be beneficial if used in areas where Onchocerca and Brugia are co-endemic with L. loa, to prevent severe adverse reactions to the drug-induced death of L. loa microfilariae. Further testing indicated that auranofin is also effective in reducing Brugia adult worm burden in infected gerbils and that auranofin may be targeting the thioredoxin reductase in this nematode.","[Bulman, Christina A.; Bidlow, Chelsea M.; Rascon, Alberto A., Jr.; Suzuki, Brian; Lim, K.

The Tsal proteins in tsetse fly saliva were previously identified as suitable biomarkers of bite exposure. A new competitive assay was conceived based on nanobody (Nb) technology to ameliorate the detection of anti-Tsal antibodies in mammalian hosts. Methodology/Principal Findings A camelid-derived Nb library was generated against the Glossina morsitans morsitans sialome and exploited to select Tsal specific Nbs. One of the three identified Nb families (family III, TsalNb-05 and TsalNb-11) was found suitable for anti-Tsal antibody detection in a competitive ELISA format. The competitive ELISA was able to detect exposure to a broad range of tsetse species (G. morsitans morsitans, G. pallidipes, G. palpalis gambiensis and G. fuscipes) and did not cross-react with the other hematophagous insects (Stomoxys calcitrans and Tabanus yao). Using a collection of plasmas from tsetse-exposed pigs, the new test characteristics were compared with those of the previously described G. m. moristans and rTsal1 indirect ELISAs, revealing equally good specificities (> 95%) and positive predictive values (> 98%) but higher negative predictive values and hence increased sensitivity (> 95%) and accuracy (> 95%). Conclusion/Significance We have developed a highly accurate Nb-based competitive immunoassay to detect specific anti-Tsal antibodies induced by various tsetse fly species in a range of hosts. We propose that this competitive assay provides a simple serological indicator of tsetse fly presence without the requirement of test adaptation to the vertebrate host species. In addition, the use of monoclonal Nbs for antibody detection is innovative and could be applied to other tsetse fly salivary biomarkers in order to achieve a multi-target immunoprofiling of hosts. In addition, this approach could be broadened to other pathogenic organisms for which accurate serological diagnosis remains a bottleneck.","[Caljon, Guy; Vermeiren, Lieve; Van den Abbeele, Jan] Inst Trop Med Antwerp ITM, Dept Biomed Sci, Unit Vet Protozool, Antwerp, Belgium; [Caljon, Guy; Hussain, Shahid] Vrije Univ Brussel, Unit Cellular & Mol Immunol, Brussels, Belgium; [Caljon, Guy; Hussain, Shahid] VIB, Lab Myeloid Cell Immunol, Brussels, Belgium; [Van den Abbeele, Jan] Univ Ghent, Dept Physiol, Lab Zoophysiol, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium","Caljon, G (reprint author), Inst Trop Med Antwerp ITM, Dept Biomed Sci, Unit Vet Protozool, Antwerp, Belgium.",gcaljon@itg.be; jvdabbeele@itg.be,"Caljon, Guy/E-1310-2017","Caljon, Guy/0000-0002-4870-3202; Van Den Abbeele, Jan/0000-0002-4533-4480",Research Foundation-Flanders [G031312N]; InterUniversity Attraction Pole program [P7/41]; EU/FP7 ERC starter grant,"This work was funded by the Research Foundation-Flanders (G031312N), the InterUniversity Attraction Pole program P7/41 and an EU/FP7 ERC starter grant (Jan Van Den Abbeele).

Early diagnosis may improve supportive care. We prospectively assessed the Standard Diagnostics (Korea) BIOLINE Dengue Duo DENV rapid diagnostic test (RDT) to NS1 antigen and anti-DENV IgM (NS1 and IgM) in children in Cambodia, with the aim of improving the diagnosis of DENV infection. Methodology and principal findings We enrolled children admitted to hospital with non-localised febrile illnesses during the 5-month DENV transmission season. Clinical and laboratory variables, and DENV RDT results were recorded at admission. Children had blood culture and serological and molecular tests for common local pathogens, including reference laboratory DENV NS1 antigen and IgM assays. 337 children were admitted with non-localised febrile illness over 5 months. 71 (21%) had DENV infection (reference assay positive). Sensitivity was 58%, and specificity 85% for RDT NS1 and IgM combined. Conditional inference framework analysis showed the additional value of platelet and white cell counts for diagnosis of DENV infection. Variables associated with diagnosis of DENV infection were not associated with critical care admission (70 children, 21%) or mortality (19 children, 6%). Known causes of mortality were melioidosis (4), other sepsis (5), and malignancy (1). 22 (27%) children with a positive DENV RDT had a treatable other infection. Conclusions The DENV RDT had low sensitivity for the diagnosis of DENV infection. The high co-prevalence of infections in our cohort indicates the need for a broad microbiological assessment of non-localised febrile illness in these children.","[Carter, Michael J.; Emary, Kate R.; Moore, Catherine E.; Parry, Christopher M.; Stoesser, Nicole; Day, Nicholas P.

Various research strategies and treatment programs for achieving the objective of eradicating schistosomiasis within a decade have been recommended and supported by the World Health Organization. One of these approaches is based on the control of snail vectors in endemic areas. Previous field studies have shown that competitor or predator introduction can reduce snail numbers, but no systematic investigation has ever been conducted to identify snail microbial pathogens and evaluate their molluscicidal effects. Methodology/Principal findings In populations of Biomphalaria glabrata snails experiencing high mortalities, white nodules were visible on snail bodies. Infectious agents were isolated from such nodules. Only one type of bacteria, identified as a new species of Paenibacillus named Candidatus Paenibacillus glabratella, was found, and was shown to be closely related to P. alvei through 16S and Rpob DNA analysis. Histopathological examination showed extensive bacterial infiltration leading to overall tissue disorganization. Exposure of healthy snails to Paenibacillus-infected snails caused massive mortality. Moreover, eggs laid by infected snails were also infected, decreasing hatching but without apparent effects on spawning. Embryonic lethality was correlated with the presence of pathogenic bacteria in eggs. Conclusions/Significance This is the first account of a novel Paenibacillus strain, Ca. Paenibacillus glabratella, as a snail microbial pathogen. Since this strain affects both adult and embryonic stages and causes significant mortality, it may hold promise as a biocontrol agent to limit schistosomiasis transmission in the field.","[Duval, David; Galinier, Richard; Mouahid, Gabriel; Toulza, Eve; Allienne, Jean Francois; Portela, Julien; Calvayrac, Christophe; Rognon, Anne; Arancibia, Nathalie; Mitta, Guillaume; Theron, Andre; Gourbal, Benjamin] CNRS, UMR 5244, 2EI, Perpignan, France; [Duval, David; Galinier, Richard; Mouahid, Gabriel; Toulza, Eve; Allienne, Jean Francois; Portela, Julien; Rognon, Anne; Arancibia, Nathalie; Mitta, Guillaume; Theron, Andre; Gourbal, Benjamin] Univ Perpignan, F-66025 Perpignan, France; [Calvayrac, Christophe] EA 4215, LCBE, Perpignan, France","Duval, D (reprint author), CNRS, UMR 5244, 2EI, Perpignan, France.",david.duval@univ-perp.fr,"Mouahid, Gabriel/F-3625-2010; ALLIENNE, Jean-Francois/B-9594-2011; Theron, Andre/B-2848-2010; DUVAL, David/B-8586-2011; Galinier, Richard/G-8278-2011; MITTA, Guillaume/A-6489-2010; GOURBAL, Benjamin E.F./B-3743-2010; Rognon, Anne/G-7935-2011; Toulza, Eve/A-9919-2012","Duval, David/0000-0001-6933-3354; Galinier, Richard/0000-0002-4180-9303; allienne, jean-francois/0000-0001-6343-308X; gourbal, benjamin/0000-0003-2097-2563; Toulza, Eve/0000-0003-2049-2279; mitta, guillaume/0000-0003-1188-1467",Centre National de la Recherche (CNRS); Universite de Perpignan Via Domitia (UPVD); ANR JCJC INVIMORY [ANR-13-JSV7-0009],"This work was supported by funds from the Centre National de la Recherche (CNRS) and the Universite de Perpignan Via Domitia (UPVD), and by a grant from the ANR JCJC INVIMORY number ANR-13-JSV7-0009.

We assessed the clustering of subpopulations and the effect of distance, sampling year, and city block location on genetic distance among pairs of insects. Despite evidence of genetic similarity, the majority of city blocks are characterized by one dominant insect genotype, suggesting the existence of barriers to dispersal. Our analyses show that streets represent an important barrier to the colonization and dispersion of T. infestans in Arequipa.

Exposure of the alimentary canal of these vectors to the host immune effectors necessitates efficient counteractive measures by hematophagous vectors. The Anopheles mosquito transmitting the malaria parasite is an example of hematophagous vectors that within seconds can ingest human blood double its weight. The innate immune defense mechanisms, like the complement system, in the human blood should thereby immediately react against foreign cells in the mosquito midgut. A prerequisite for complement activation is that the target cells lack complement regulators on their surfaces. In this work, we analyzed whether human complement is active in the mosquito midgut, and how the mosquito midgut cells protect themselves against complement attack. We found that complement remained active for a considerable time and was able to kill microbes within the mosquito midgut. However, the Anopheles mosquito midgut cells were not injured. These cells were found to protect themselves by capturing factor H, the main soluble inhibitor of the alternative complement pathway. Factor H inhibited complement on the midgut cells by promoting inactivation of C3b to iC3b and preventing the activity of the alternative pathway amplification C3 convertase enzyme. An interference of the FH regulatory activity by monoclonal antibodies, carried to the midgut via blood, resulted in increased mosquito mortality and reduced fecundity. By using a ligand blotting assay, a putative mosquito midgut FH receptor could be detected. Thereby, we have identified a novel mechanism whereby mosquitoes can tolerate human blood.","[Khattab, Ayman; Barroso, Marta; Miettinen, Tiera; Meri, Seppo] Univ Helsinki, Haartman Inst, Immunobiol Res Program, Res Program Unit, Helsinki, Finland; [Meri, Seppo] Univ Helsinki, Cent Hosp, Helsinki, Finland","Khattab, A (reprint author), Univ Helsinki, Haartman Inst, Immunobiol Res Program, Res Program Unit, Helsinki, Finland.",ayman.khattab@helsinki.fi,,"Meri, Seppo/0000-0001-9142-501X; Khattab, Ayman/0000-0002-3980-8379",Helsinki University [212/51/2011]; Helsinki University Central Hospital EVO funds [TYM2012237]; Academy of Finland [SA1279755]; Stockmann Foundation; Sigrid Juselius Foundation,"This work was supported by Helsinki University (http://www.helsinki.fi/university/) Three Years Research grant (212/51/2011) to AK and Helsinki University Central Hospital EVO funds (TYM2012237), Academy of Finland (www.aka.fi) (SA1279755), Stockmann Foundation and Sigrid Juselius Foundation (http://www.sigridjuselius.fi/ foundation) grants to SM.

Participants were examined for TF, had conjunctival swabs collected for nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT)-based detection of Ct, and blood collected for analysis of antibodies to the Ct antigens pgp3 and CT694 by multiplex bead-based immunoassay. Seroconversion rate was used to estimate changes in the force of infection in a reversible catalytic model. No conjunctival swabs tested positive for Ct infection by NAAT. Among 1-9 year olds, TF prevalence was 6.5%, whereas only 3.5% were seropositive. Force of infection modelling indicated a 10-fold decrease in seroconversion rate at a time corresponding to MDA commencement. Without baseline serological data, the inferences we can make about antibody status before MDA and the longevity of the antibody response are limited, though our use of catalytic modelling overcomes some of these limitations. Conclusions/Significance Serologic tests support NAAT findings of very low to zero prevalence of ocular Ct in this community and have potential to provide objective measures of transmission and useful surveillance tools for trachoma elimination programs.","[Martin, Diana L.; Goodhew, E.

Few studies have examined the ecology and epidemiology of this pathogen in rural tropical systems characterized by high rates of overlap among humans, domesticated animals, and wildlife. We investigated risk factors for Cryptosporidium infection and assessed cross-species transmission potential among people, non-human primates, and domestic animals in the Gombe Ecosystem, Kigoma District, Tanzania. A cross-sectional survey was designed to determine the occurrence and risk factors for Cryptosporidium infection in humans, domestic animals and wildlife living in and around Gombe National Park. Diagnostic PCR revealed Cryptosporidium infection rates of 4.3% in humans, 16.0% in non-human primates, and 9.6% in livestock. Local streams sampled were negative. DNA sequencing uncovered a complex epidemiology for Cryptosporidium in this system, with humans, baboons and a subset of chimpanzees infected with C. hominis subtype IfA12G2; another subset of chimpanzees infected with C. suis; and all positive goats and sheep infected with C. xiaoi. For humans, residence location was associated with increased risk of infection in Mwamgongo village compared to one camp ( Kasekela), and there was an increased odds for infection when living in a household with another positive person. Fecal consistency and other gastrointestinal signs did not predict Cryptosporidium infection. Despite a high degree of habitat overlap between village people and livestock, our results suggest that there are distinct Cryptosporidium transmission dynamics for humans and livestock in this system. The dominance of C. hominis subtype IfA12G2 among humans and non-human primates suggest cross-species transmission. Interestingly, a subset of chimpanzees was infected with C. suis. We hypothesize that there is cross-species transmission from bush pigs (Potaochoerus larvatus) to chimpanzees in Gombe forest, since domesticated pigs are regionally absent. Our findings demonstrate a complex nature of Cryptosporidium in sympatric primates, including humans, and stress the need for further studies.","[Parsons, Michele B.; Gillespie, Thomas R.] Emory Univ, Program Populat Biol Ecol & Evolut, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA; [Parsons, Michele B.; Gillespie, Thomas R.] Emory Univ, Dept Environm Sci, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA; [Parsons, Michele B.; Gillespie, Thomas R.] Emory Univ, Dept Environm Hlth, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA; [Parsons, Michele B.; Roellig, Dawn M.

Histones and Acid Ribosomal proteins are already known to induce an effective immune response and have successfully been tested in the cutaneous leishmaniasis mouse model. Here, we investigate the protective ability of L. infantum nucleosomal histones (HIS) and ribosomal acidic protein P0 (LiP0) against L. infantum infection in the hamster model of visceral leishmaniasis using two different strategies: homologous (plasmid DNA only) or heterologous immunization (plasmid DNA plus recombinant protein and adjuvant). Methodology/Principal Findings Immunization with both antigens using the heterologous strategy presented a high antibody production level while the homologous strategy immunized group showed predominantly a cellular immune response with parasite load reduction. The pcDNA-LiP0 immunized group showed increased expression ratio of IFN-gamma/IL-10 and IFN-gamma/TGF-beta in the lymph nodes before challenge. Two months after infection hamsters immunized with the empty plasmid presented a pro-inflammatory immune response in the early stages of infection with increased expression ratio of IFN-gamma/IL-10 and IFN-gamma/TGF-beta, whereas hamsters immunized with pcDNA-HIS presented an increase only in the ratio IFN-gamma/TGF-beta. On the other hand, hamsters immunized with LiP0 did not present any increase in the IFN-gamma/TGF-beta and IFN-gamma/IL-10 ratio independently of the immunization strategy used. Conversely, five months after infection, hamsters immunized with HIS maintained a pro-inflammatory immune response (ratio IFN-gamma/IL-10) while pcDNA-LiP0 immunized hamsters continued showing a balanced cytokine profile of pro and anti-inflammatory cytokines. Moreover we observed a significant reduction in parasite load in the spleen, liver and lymph node in this group compared with controls. Conclusions/Significance Our results suggest that vaccination with L. infantum LiP0 antigen administered in a DNA formulation could be considered a potential component in a vaccine formulation against visceral leishmaniasis.","[Pereira, Lais; Abbehusen, Melissa; Teixeira, Clarissa; Cunha, Jurema; Fukutani, Kyioshi; dos-Santos, Washington; Barral, Aldina; de Oliveira, Camila Indiani; Barral-Netto, Manoel; Brodskyn, Claudia Ida] FIOCRUZ BA, Ctr Pesquisa Goncalo Moniz, Salvador, BA, Brazil; [Nascimento, Ivan P.] Inst Butantan, Ctr Biotecnol, Sao Paulo, Brazil; [Barral, Aldina; Barral-Netto, Manoel] Univ Fed Bahia, Fac Med, BR-41170290 Salvador, BA, Brazil; [Barral, Aldina; de Oliveira, Camila Indiani; Barral-Netto, Manoel; Brodskyn, Claudia Ida] Inst Invest Imunol, Sao Paulo, Brazil; [Soto, Manoel] Univ Autonoma Madrid, Ctr Biol Mol Severo Ochoa, Madrid, Spain; [Brodskyn, Claudia Ida] Univ Fed Bahia, Inst Ciencias Saude, BR-41170290 Salvador, BA, Brazil","Pereira, L (reprint author), FIOCRUZ BA, Ctr Pesquisa Goncalo Moniz, Salvador, BA, Brazil.",brodskyn@bahia.fiocruz.br,"Fukutani, Kiyoshi/N-7905-2016; Nascimento, Ivan/G-9520-2012; Barral-Netto, Manoel/B-3904-2009; Alvarez, Manuel Soto/Q-5234-2018; Fukutani, Kiyoshi/T-1630-2019","Fukutani, Kiyoshi/0000-0003-2223-0918; Nascimento, Ivan/0000-0001-9843-1594; Barral-Netto, Manoel/0000-0002-5823-7903; Alvarez, Manuel Soto/0000-0001-6825-841X; DE OLIVEIRA, CAMILA INDIANI/0000-0002-7868-5164; Nascimento, Ivan/0000-0002-5293-3967",CNPq; CYTED,"This study was funded by CNPq and CYTED.

Aegypti, the primary vector for dengue virus (DENV). Implementation of vector control measures to control dengue that specifically target Ae. Aegypti may not control DENV transmission in Puerto Rico (PR). Even if Ae. Aegypti is eliminated or DENV refractory mosquitoes are released, DENV transmission may not cease when other competent mosquito species like Ae. Mediovittatus are present. To compare vector competence of Ae. Mediovittatus and Ae. Aegypti mosquitoes, we studied relative infection and transmission rates for all four DENV serotypes. Methods To compare the vector competence of Ae. Mediovittatus and Ae. Aegypti, mosquitoes were exposed to DENV 1-4 per os at viral titers of 5-6 logs plaque-forming unit (pfu) equivalents. At 14 days post infectious bloodmeal, viral RNA was extracted and tested by qRT-PCR to determine infection and transmission rates. Infection and transmission rates were analyzed with a generalized linear model assuming a binomial distribution. Results Ae. Aegypti had significantly higher DENV-4 infection and transmission rates than Ae. mediovittatus. Conclusions This study determined that Ae. Mediovittatus is a competent DENV vector. Therefore dengue prevention programs in PR and the Caribbean should consider both Ae. Mediovittatus and Ae. Aegypti mosquitoes in their vector control programs.","[Poole-Smith, B.

The aim of this study was to systematically review the existing data informing current understanding of the prevalence of Chagas disease in LA migrants living in European countries. Methods We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies reporting prevalence of Chagas disease in European countries belonging to the European Union (EU) before 2004 in accordance with the MOOSE guidelines and based on the database sources MEDLINE and Global Health. No restrictions were placed on study date, study design or language of publication. The pooled prevalence was estimated using random effect models based on DerSimonian & Laird method. Results We identified 18 studies conducted in five European countries. The random effect pooled prevalence was 4.2% (95%CI:2.2-6.7%); and the heterogeneity of Chagas disease prevalence among studies was high (I2 = 97%, p<0.001). Migrants from Bolivia had the highest prevalence of Chagas disease (18.1%, 95% CI:13.9-22.7%). Conclusions Prevalence of Chagas in LA migrants living in Europe is high, particularly in migrants from Bolivia and Paraguay. Data are highly heterogeneous dependent upon country of origin and within studies of migrants from the same country of origin. Country-specific prevalence differs from the estimates available from LA countries. Our meta-analysis provides prevalence estimates of Chagas disease that should be used to estimate the burden of disease in European countries.","[Requena-Mendez, Ana; Aldasoro, Edelweiss; de Lazzari, Elisa; Sicuri, Elisa; Gascon, Joaquim; Munoz, Jose] Univ Barcelona, Hosp Clin, ISGlobal, Barcelona Ctr Int Hlth Res CRESIB, Barcelona, Spain; [Brown, Michael; Moore, David A.

RVF transmission during inter-epidemic periods (IEP) generally passes undetected in absence of surveillance in mammalian hosts and vectors. We studied IEP transmission of RVF and evaluated the demographic, behavioural, occupational and spatial determinants of past RVF infection. Methodology Between March and August 2012 we collected blood samples, and administered a risk factor questionnaire among 606 inhabitants of 6 villages in the seasonally inundated Kilombero Valley, Tanzania. ELISA tests were used to detect RVFV IgM and IgG antibodies in serum samples. Risk factors were examined by mixed effects logistic regression. Findings RVF virus IgM antibodies, indicating recent RVFV acquisition, were detected in 16 participants, representing 2.6% overall and in 22.5% of inhibition ELISA positives (n = 71). Four of 16 (25.0%) IgM positives and 11/71 (15.5%) of individuals with inhibition ELISA sero-positivity reported they had had no previous contact with host animals. Sero-positivity on inhibition ELISA was 11.7%(95% CI 9.2-14.5) and risk was elevated with age (odds ratio (OR) 1.03 per year; 95% CI 1.01-1.04), among milkers (OR 2.19; 95% CI 1.23-3.91), and individuals eating raw meat (OR 4.17; 95% CI 1.18-14.66). Households keeping livestock had a higher probability of having members with evidence of past infection (OR = 3.04, 95% CI = 1.42-6.48) than those that do not keep livestock. Conclusion There is inter-epidemic acquisition of RVFV in Kilombero Valley inhabitants. In the wake of declining malaria incidence, these findings underscore the need for clinicians to consider RVF in the differential diagnosis for febrile illnesses. Several types of direct contact with livestock are important risk factors for past infection with RVFV in this study's population. However, at least part of RVFV transmission appears to have occurred through bites of infected mosquitoes.","[Sumaye, Robert David; Amuri, Mbaraka; Geubbels, Eveline] Ifakara Hlth Inst, Ifakara, Tanzania; [Sumaye, Robert David; Abatih, Emmanuel Nji; Berkvens, Dirk] Inst Trop Med, Dept Biomed Sci, B-2000 Antwerp, Belgium; [Sumaye, Robert David; Thiry, Etienne] Univ Liege, Fac Vet Med, Dept Infect & Parasit Dis, Liege, Belgium","Sumaye, RD (reprint author), Ifakara Hlth Inst, Ifakara, Tanzania.",rsumaye@ihi.or.tz,"AMURI, Mbaraka/C-5386-2011","AMURI, Mbaraka/0000-0002-8583-9555; Sumaye, Robert/0000-0001-9734-3226; Geubbels, Eveline/0000-0002-9702-5460","Belgian Directorate General for Development Cooperation (DGDC), through Institute of Tropical Medicine, Antwerp","This work was funded through a scholarship awarded to RDS by Belgian Directorate General for Development Cooperation (DGDC), through Institute of Tropical Medicine, Antwerp.

Sustainable strategies are needed to control vectors of Chagas disease such as Rhodnius prolixus. The insect microbiota can be modified to deliver molecules to the gut. Here, Escherichia coli HT115(DE3) expressing dsRNA for the Rhodnius heme-binding protein (RHBP) and for catalase (CAT) were fed to nymphs and adult triatomine stages. RHBP is an egg protein and CAT is an antioxidant enzyme expressed in all tissues by all developmental stages. The RNA interference effect was systemic and temporal. Concentrations of E. coli HT115(DE3) above 3.35 x 10(7) CFU/mL produced a significant RHBP and CAT gene knockdown in nymphs and adults. RHBP expression in the fat body was reduced by 99% three days after feeding, returning to normal levels 10 days after feeding. CAT expression was reduced by 99% and 96% in the ovary and the posterior midgut, respectively, five days after ingestion. Mortality rates increased by 24-30% in first instars fed RHBP and CAT bacteria. Molting rates were reduced by 100% in first instars and 80% in third instars fed bacteria producing RHBP or CAT dsRNA. Oviposition was reduced by 43% (RHBP) and 84% (CAT). Embryogenesis was arrested in 16% (RHBP) and 20% (CAT) of laid eggs. Feeding females 105 CFU/mL of the natural symbiont, Rhodococcus rhodnii, transformed to express RHBP-specific hairpin RNA reduced RHBP expression by 89% and reduced oviposition. Modifying the insect microbiota to induce systemic RNAi in R. prolixus may result in a paratransgenic strategy for sustainable vector control.","[Taracena, Mabel L.; Oliveira, Pedro L.; Paiva-Silva, Gabriela O.] Univ Fed Rio de Janeiro, Programa Biol Mol & Biotecnol, Inst Bioquim Med Leopoldo de Meis, CCS,Ilha Fundao, Rio De Janeiro, Brazil; [Taracena, Mabel L.; Umana, Claudia] Univ Valle Guatemala, ECtr Estudios Salud, Guatemala City, Guatemala; [Almendares, Olivia; Dotson, Ellen M.] Ctr Dis Control & Prevent, Div Parasit Dis & Malaria, Atlanta, GA USA; [Lowenberger, Carl; Pennington, Pamela M.] Simon Fraser Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Burnaby, BC V5A 1S6, Canada","Taracena, ML (reprint author), Univ Fed Rio de Janeiro, Programa Biol Mol & Biotecnol, Inst Bioquim Med Leopoldo de Meis, CCS,Ilha Fundao, Rio De Janeiro, Brazil.",gosilva@bioqmed.ufrj.br; pamelap@uvg.edu.gt,"Oliveira, Pedro/A-9438-2010","Oliveira, Pedro/0000-0003-0307-354X","Fondo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia, -FONACYT- of the National Secretariat for Science and Technology - SENACYT-; National Council for Science and Technology - CONCYT- of Guatemala; Latin American and Caribbean Research Exchange Grant; Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico; Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior; Fundacao Carlos Chagas Filho de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado do Rio de Janeiro; Programa de Apoio a Nucleos de Excelencia; Howard Hughes Medical Institute","The work was made possible by funding to PMP from Fondo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia, -FONACYT- of the National Secretariat for Science and Technology - SENACYT- and the support of the National Council for Science and Technology - CONCYT- of Guatemala.

In response to this largely unmet need for new treatments, the Consortium for Parasitic Drug Development developed novel parenteral diamidines and corresponding oral prodrugs that have shown cure of a murine model of second stage HAT. As a rationale for selection of one of these compounds for further development, the pharmacokinetics and efficacy of intramuscular (IM) active diamidine 2,5-bis(5-amidino-2-pyridyl) furan (DB829; CPD-0802) and oral prodrug2,5-bis[5-(N-methoxyamidino)-2-pyridyl] furan (DB868) were compared in the vervet monkey model of second stage HAT. Treatment was initiated 28 days post-infection of monkeys with T. b. rhodesiense KETRI 2537. Results showed that IM DB829 at 5 mg/kg/day for 5 consecutive days, 5 mg/kg/day every other day for 5 doses, or 2.5 mg/kg/day for 5 consecutive days cured all monkeys (5/5). Oral DB868 was less successful, with no cures (0/2) at 3 mg/kg/day for 10 days and cure rates of 1/4 at 10 mg/kg/day for 10 days and 20 mg/kg/day for 10 days; in total, only 2/10 monkeys were cured with DB868 dose regimens. The geometric mean plasma Cmax of IM DB829 at 5 mg/kg following the last of 5 doses was 25-fold greater than that after 10 daily oral doses of DB868 at 20 mg/kg. These data suggest that the active diamidine DB829, administered IM, should be considered for further development as a potential new treatment for second stage HAT.","[Thuita, John K.; Murilla, Grace A.; Mutuku, James N.; Gem, Charles O.] Kenya Agr Res Inst TRC KARI, Trypanosomiasis Res Ctr, Kikuyu, Kenya; [Wolf, Kristina K.; Liu, Qiang; Paine, Mary F.] Univ N Carolina, Eshelman Sch Pharm, Chapel Hill, NC USA; [Bridges, Arlene S.; Jones, Susan K.; Tidwell, Richard R.] Univ N Carolina, Sch Med, Dept Pathol & Lab Med, Chapel Hill, NC USA; [Boykin, David W.] Georgia State Univ, Dept Chem, Atlanta, GA 30303 USA; [Ching, Shelley] SVC Associates Inc, Apex, NC USA; [Wang, Michael Z.] Univ Kansas, Dept Pharmaceut Chem, Lawrence, KS 66045 USA; [Brun, Reto] Swiss Trop & Publ Hlth Inst, Basel, Switzerland; [Brun, Reto] Univ Basel, Basel, Switzerland","Thuita, JK (reprint author), Kenya Agr Res Inst TRC KARI, Trypanosomiasis Res Ctr, Kikuyu, Kenya.",thuitajk@yahoo.com,,,Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation through the Consortium for Parasitic Drug,"This investigation received financial support from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation through the Consortium for Parasitic Drug.

Some foci are found in shade-grown cocoa and coffee plantations, or near perennial forests that provide rich breeding grounds for the sand fly vectors, but also harbor a variety of bat species that live off the abundant fruits provided by these shade-giving trees. The close proximity between sand flies and bats makes their interaction feasible, yet bats infected with Leishmania (L.) mexicana have not been reported. Here we analyzed 420 bats from six states of Mexico that had reported patients with leishmaniasis. Tissues of bats, including skin, heart, liver and/or spleen were screened by PCR for Leishmania (L.) mexicana DNA. We found that 41 bats (9.77%), belonging to 13 species, showed positive PCR results in various tissues. The infected tissues showed no evidence of macroscopic lesions. Of the infected bats, 12 species were frugivorous, insectivorous or nectarivorous, and only one species was sanguivorous (Desmodus rotundus), and most of them belonged to the family Phyllostomidae. The eco-region where most of the infected bats were caught is the Gulf Coastal Plain of Chiapas and Tabasco. Through experimental infections of two Tadarida brasiliensis bats in captivity, we show that this species can harbor viable, infective Leishmania (L.) mexicana parasites that are capable of infecting BALB/c mice. We conclude that various species of bats belonging to the family Phyllostomidae are possible reservoir hosts for Leishmania (L.) mexicana, if it can be shown that such bats are infective for the sand fly vector. Further studies are needed to determine how these bats become infected, how long the parasite remains viable inside these potential hosts and whether they are infective to sand flies to fully evaluate their impact on disease epidemiology.","[Berzunza-Cruz, Miriam; Bailon-Martinez, Dulce; Becker, Ingeborg] Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Unidad Invest Med Expt, Mexico City 04510, DF, Mexico; [Rodriguez-Moreno, Angel; Gutierrez-Granados, Gabriel; Balcells, Cristina Domingo; Sanchez-Cordero, Victor] Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Inst Biol, Mexico City 04510, DF, Mexico; [Gonzalez-Salazar, Constantino; Stephens, Christopher R.] Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Ctr Ciencias Complejidad C3, Mexico City 04510, DF, Mexico; [Gonzalez-Salazar, Constantino] Comis Nacl Conocimiento & Uso Biodiversidad, Mexico City 14010, DF, Mexico; [Stephens, Christopher R.] Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Inst Ciencias Nucl, Mexico City 04510, DF, Mexico; [Hidalgo-Mihart, Mircea] Univ Juarez Autonoma Tabasco, Div Acad Ciencias Biol, Villahermosa, Mexico; [Marina, Carlos F.] Ctr Reg Invest Salud Publ INSP, Tapachula, Chiapas, Mexico; [Rebollar-Tellez, Eduardo A.] Univ Autonoma Nuevo Leon, Fac Ciencias Biol, Dept Zool Invertebrados, Lab Entomol Med, San Nicolas de los Garza, Mexico; [Ibarra-Cerdena, Carlos N.] Ctr Invest Estudios Avanzados Inst Politecn Nacl, Dept Ecol Humana, Merida, Yucatan, Mexico","Sanchez-Cordero, V (reprint author), Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Inst Biol, Mexico City 04510, DF, Mexico.",victor@ib.unam.mx; becker@unam.mx,"Gonzalez-Salazar, Constantino/M-3913-2015","Gonzalez-Salazar, Constantino/0000-0001-7347-714X; REBOLLAR-TELLEZ, EDUARDO/0000-0002-8173-3550; Hidalgo Mihart, Mircea G/0000-0002-8779-6886; Ibarra-Cerdena, Carlos N./0000-0003-4980-4344; Marina Fernandez, Carlos Felix/0000-0002-4804-8949","Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico [PAPIIT IN215212, IN 202711, IN 209314]; Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONACyT) [132811]; Centro de Ciencias de la Complejidad, Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico; CONACyT-FOSSIS [69530]","This work was funded by the Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico (PAPIIT IN215212 to IB, IN 202711, IN 209314 to VSC).

Because the eggs of many helminth species can survive in environmental media, reuse of untreated or partially treated human waste, commonly called night soil, may promote transmission of human helminthiases. Methodology/Principal Findings We conducted an open cohort study in 36 villages to evaluate the association between night soil use and schistosomiasis in a region of China where schistosomiasis has reemerged and persisted despite control activities. We tested 2,005 residents for Schistosoma japonicum infection in 2007 and 1,365 residents in 2010 and interviewed heads of household about agricultural practices each study year. We used an intervention attributable ratio framework to estimate the association between night soil use and S. japonicum infection. Night soil use was reported by half of households (56% in 2007 and 46% in 2010). Village night soil use was strongly associated with human S. japonicum infection in 2007. We estimate cessation of night soil use would lead to a 49% reduction in infection prevalence in 2007 (95% CI: 12%, 71%). However, no association between night soil and schistosomiasis was observed in 2010. These inconsistent findings may be due to unmeasured confounding or temporal shifts in the importance of different sources of S. japonicum eggs on the margins of disease elimination. Conclusions/Significance The use of untreated or partially treated human waste as an agricultural fertilizer may be a barrier to permanent reductions in human helminthiases. This practice warrants further attention by the public health community.","[Carlton, Elizabeth J.] Univ Colorado, Colorado Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Environm & Occupat Hlth, Aurora, CO 80045 USA; [Liu, Yang; Zhong, Bo] Sichuan Ctr Dis Control & Prevent, Inst Parasit Dis, Chengdu, Peoples R China; [Hubbard, Alan] Univ Calif Berkeley, Div Biostat, Sch Publ Hlth, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Spear, Robert C.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Sch Publ Hlth, Ctr Occupat & Environm Hlth, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA","Carlton, EJ (reprint author), Univ Colorado, Colorado Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Environm & Occupat Hlth, Anschutz Med Campus, Aurora, CO 80045 USA.",elizabeth.carlton@ucdenver.edu,,"Carlton, Elizabeth/0000-0002-8664-9606; Spear, Robert/0000-0002-7667-2941",National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases [R01AI068854]; American Recovery and Reinvestment Act supplement [R01AI068854-04S1],"This research was supported a grant from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (R01AI068854), and an American Recovery and Reinvestment Act supplement (R01AI068854-04S1).

Most patients experience chronic or multiple acute ENL over many years during an economically active period of their lives. Understanding the economic burden of ENL is essential to provide effective patient support, yet this area has not been investigated. Methods Ninety-one patients with LL or BL leprosy attending a leprosy hospital in Purulia district of West Bengal, India, were interviewed using a structured questionnaire. Cases (n = 53) were identified as those who had one or more episodes of ENL within the last 3 years. Controls (n = 38) had LL or BL leprosy but no history of ENL. Data were collected on household income, direct and indirect costs, and coping strategies. Findings The total household cost was Rs 1543 per month or 27.9%(IQR 13.2-52.6) of monthly household income for cases, and Rs 237 per month or 4.9% (IQR 1.7-13.4) of monthly household income for controls. Indirect costs accounted for 65% of total household costs for cases. Direct costs accounted for the remaining 35% of household costs, and resulted almost entirely from treatment-seeking in the private sector. Total household costs exceeded 40% of household income for 37.7% of cases (n = 20) and 2.6% of controls (n = 1) [1 USD = 59 INR]. Interpretation Households affected by ENL face significant economic burden and are at risk of being pushed further into poverty. Health policy should acknowledge the importance of private sector provision and the significant contribution to total household costs of lost productivity (indirect cost). Further work is needed to explore this area and identify solutions.","[Chandler, David J.; Lockwood, Diana N.

A better understanding of the epidemiology of these infections and factors contributing to their occurrence will inform effective elimination strategies. While the epidemiology of SM P. falciparum infections has been documented, that of SM P. vivax infections has not been summarised. The objective of this study is to address this deficiency. Methodology/Principal Findings: A systematic search of PubMed was conducted, and results of both light microscopy (LM) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based diagnostic tests for P. vivax from 44 cross-sectional surveys or screening studies of clinical malaria suspects were analysed. Analysis revealed that SM P. vivax is prevalent across different geographic areas with varying transmission intensities. On average, the prevalence of SM P. vivax in cross-sectional surveys was 10.9%, constituting 67.0% of all P. vivax infections detected by PCR. The relative proportion of SM P. vivax is significantly higher than that of the sympatric P. falciparum in these settings. A positive relationship exists between PCR and LM P. vivax prevalence, while there is a negative relationship between the proportion of SM P. vivax and the LM prevalence for P. vivax. Amongst clinical malaria suspects, however, SM P. vivax was not identified. Conclusions/Significance: SM P. vivax is prevalent across different geographic areas, particularly areas with relatively low transmission intensity. Diagnostic tools with sensitivity greater than that of LM are required for detecting these infection reservoirs. In contrast, SM P. vivax is not prevalent in clinical malaria suspects, supporting the recommended use of quality LM and rapid diagnostic tests in clinical case management. These findings enable malaria control and elimination programs to estimate the prevalence and proportion of SM P. vivax infections in their settings, and develop appropriate elimination strategies to tackle SM P. vivax to interrupt transmission.","[Cheng, Qin] Australian Army Malaria Inst, Drug Resistance & Diagnost, Brisbane, Qld, Australia; [Cheng, Qin; Gatton, Michelle L.] QIMR Berghofer Med Res Inst, Brisbane, Qld, Australia; [Cunningham, Jane] World Hlth Org, Global Malaria Program, Geneva, Switzerland; [Gatton, Michelle L.] Queensland Univ Technol, Sch Publ Hlth & Social Work, Brisbane, Qld 4001, Australia","Cheng, Q (reprint author), Australian Army Malaria Inst, Drug Resistance & Diagnost, Brisbane, Qld, Australia.",qin.cheng@defence.gov.au,"Gatton, Michelle/H-3139-2019","Gatton, Michelle/0000-0003-1188-609X","Department of Defence, Australia; World Health Organization through a grant from UNITAID; Queensland University of Technology","QC is funded by Department of Defence, Australia; JC by the World Health Organization through a grant from UNITAID; and MLG by the Queensland University of Technology.

However, vaccination studies on species of the subgenus Viannia, the main causative agent of cutaneous and mucosal leishmaniasis in the Americas, have been hampered by the lack of easy-to-handle bio-models that accurately mimic the human disease. Recently, we demonstrated that the golden hamster is an appropriate model for studying the immunopathogenesis of cutaneous leishmaniasis caused by L. (Viannia) braziliensis. Using the golden hamster model, our current study investigated whether the protective effect of intranasal immunisation with LaAg can be extended to L. braziliensis infection. Methodology/Principal Findings: Golden hamsters vaccinated with either two intranasal (IN) doses of LaAg (10 mu g) or two intramuscular doses of LaAg (20 mu g) were challenged 2 weeks post-vaccination with L. braziliensis. The results showed that IN immunisation with LaAg significantly reduced lesion growth and parasitic load as well as serum IgG and IgG2 levels. At the experimental endpoint on day 114 post-infection, IN-immunised hamsters that were considered protected expressed IFN-gamma and IL10 mRNA levels that returned to uninfected skin levels. In contrast to the nasal route, intramuscular (IM) immunisation failed to provide protection. Conclusions/Significance: These results demonstrate for the first time that the nasal route of immunisation can induce cross protection against L. braziliensis infection.","[da Silva-Couto, Luzinei; Ribeiro-Romao, Raquel Peralva; Saavedra, Andrea Franco; Gomes-Silva, Adriano; Da-Cruz, Alda Maria; Pinto, Eduardo Fonseca] Fiocruz MS, Inst Oswaldo Cruz, Lab Interdisciplinar Pesquisas Med, BR-21045900 Rio De Janeiro, Brazil; [da Silva Costa Souza, Beatriz Lilian; Rossi-Bergmann, Bartira] Univ Fed Rio de Janeiro, Inst Biofis Carlos Chagas Filho, Lab Imunofarmacol, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil; [Moreira, Otacilio Cruz] Fiocruz MS, Lab Biol Mol & Doencas Endem, Inst Oswaldo Cruz, BR-21045900 Rio De Janeiro, Brazil","da Silva-Couto, L (reprint author), Fiocruz MS, Inst Oswaldo Cruz, Lab Interdisciplinar Pesquisas Med, BR-21045900 Rio De Janeiro, Brazil.",eduardo@ioc.fiocruz.br,,,"Instituto Oswaldo Cruz/Fundacao Oswaldo Cruz; Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado do Rio de Janeiro (FAPERJ) [APQ-1 - E26/111.797/2012, JCNE-26/103.111/2008]; Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPq) [Universal 14/2012 - MCTI/CNPq, 486604/2012-8]; Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES); FAPERJ; CNPq/Fundacao Oswaldo Cruz","This work was funded by Instituto Oswaldo Cruz/Fundacao Oswaldo Cruz internal funds, by Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado do Rio de Janeiro (FAPERJ)(grant numbers: APQ-1 - E26/111.797/2012, JCNE-26/103.111/2008) and by Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPq)(grant number: Universal 14/2012 - MCTI/CNPq, 486604/2012-8).

In this study, we used a simple Enzyme Linked Aptamer (ELA) assay to detect T. cruzi biomarker in blood and validate murine drug discovery models of Chagas disease. In two mice models, Apt-29 ELA assay demonstrated that biomarker levels were significantly higher in the infected group compared to the control group, and upon Benznidazole treatment, their levels reduced. However, biomarker levels in the infected treated group did not reduce to those seen in the non-infected treated group, with 100% of the mice above the assay cutoff, suggesting that parasitemia was reduced but cure was not achieved. The ELA assay was capable of detecting circulating biomarkers in mice infected with various strains of T. cruzi parasites. Our results showed that the ELA assay could detect residual parasitemia in treated mice by providing an overall picture of the infection in the host. They suggest that the ELA assay can be used in drug discovery applications to assess treatment efficacy in-vivo.","[de Araujo, Fernanda Fortes; Nagarkatti, Rana; Gupta, Charu; Debrabant, Alain] US FDA, Lab Emerging Pathogens, Div Emerging & Transfus Transmitted Dis, Ctr Biol Evaluat & Res, Silver Spring, MD 20993 USA; [Marino, Ana Paula] NIAID, Mol Signaling Sect, Lab Mol Immunol, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA","de Araujo, FF (reprint author), US FDA, Lab Emerging Pathogens, Div Emerging & Transfus Transmitted Dis, Ctr Biol Evaluat & Res, Silver Spring, MD 20993 USA.",alain.debrabant@fda.hhs.gov,,"Gupta, Charu/0000-0002-7437-6559",US Food and Drug Administration,"Research was supported by intramural grants from the US Food and Drug Administration to AD.

Most viruses were closely related to lineages known to have circulated in Indonesia for some time, indicating that this geographic region serves as a major hub for dengue genetic diversity. Most notably, we identified a new lineage of DENV-2 (Cosmopolitan genotype) that emerged in Bali in 2011-2012. The spread of this lineage should clearly be monitored.

Worldwide, approximately 20% of zoonotic human visceral leishmaniasis is caused by Leishmania infantum, also known as Leishmania chagasi in Latin America. Current diagnostic methods are not accurate enough to identify Leishmania-infected animals and may compromise the effectiveness of disease control. Therefore, we aimed to produce and test two recombinant multiepitope proteins as a means to improve and increase accuracy in the diagnosis of canine visceral leishmaniasis (CVL). Methodology/Principal Findings: Ten antigenic peptides were identified by CVL ELISA in previous work. In the current proposal, the coding sequences of these ten peptides were assembled into a synthetic gene. Furthermore, other twenty peptides were selected from work by our group where good B and T cell epitopes were mapped. The coding sequences of these peptides were also assembled into a synthetic gene. Both genes have been cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli, producing two multiepitope recombinant proteins, PQ10 and PQ20. These antigens have been used in CVL ELISA and were able to identify asymptomatic dogs (80%) more effectively than EIE-LVC kit, produced by Bio-Manguinhos (0%) and DPP kit (10%). Moreover, our recombinant proteins presented an early detection (before PCR) of infected dogs, with positivities ranging from 23% to 65%, depending on the phase of infection in which sera were acquired. Conclusions/Significance: Our study shows that ELISA using the multiepitope proteins PQ10 and PQ20 has great potential in early CVL diagnosis. The use of these proteins in other methodologies, such as immunochromatographic tests, could be beneficial mainly for the detection of asymptomatic dogs.","[Faria, Angelica Rosa; Veloso, Luciano de Castro; Andrade, Helida M.] Univ Fed Minas Gerais, Inst Ciencias Biol, Dept Parasitologia, Belo Horizonte, MG, Brazil; [Coura-Vital, Wendel; Reis, Alexandre Barbosa] Univ Fed Ouro Preto, Nucleo Pesquisa Ciencias Biol, Minas Gerais, Brazil; [Damasceno, Leonardo Miranda; Gazzinelli, Ricardo T.] Univ Fed Minas Gerais, Inst Ciencias Biol, Dept Bioquim & Imunol, Belo Horizonte, MG, Brazil; [Gazzinelli, Ricardo T.] Fundacao Oswaldo Cruz, Ctr Pesquisas Rene Rachou, Belo Horizonte, MG, Brazil; [Gazzinelli, Ricardo T.] Univ Massachusetts Med Sch, Div Infect Dis & Immunol, Worcester, MA USA","Faria, AR (reprint author), Univ Fed Minas Gerais, Inst Ciencias Biol, Dept Parasitologia, Belo Horizonte, MG, Brazil.",helida@icb.ufmg.br,,"/0000-0002-1434-7676; Gazzinelli, Ricardo/0000-0003-2427-7699",Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Minas Gerais (FAPEMIG); Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPq); Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES); Instituto Nacional de Ciencia e Tecnologia de Vacinas (INCTV); Rede Mineira de Biomoleculas,"This work was supported by Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Minas Gerais (FAPEMIG), Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPq), Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES), Instituto Nacional de Ciencia e Tecnologia de Vacinas (INCTV) and Rede Mineira de Biomoleculas.

Mass distribution of azithromycin is now the cornerstone of the WHO yaws eradication campaign. Mass distribution of azithromycin at a lower target dose was previously undertaken in two regions of Ghana for the control of trachoma. Ongoing reporting of yaws raises the possibility that resistance may have emerged in T. pallidum pertenue, or that alternative infections may be responsible for some of the reported cases. We conducted a cross-sectional survey in thirty communities in two districts of Ghana where MDA for trachoma had previously been conducted. Children aged 5-17 years with ulcerative lesions compatible with yaws were enrolled. Samples for treponemal serology and lesion PCR were collected from all children. 90 children with 98 lesions were enrolled. Syphilis serology was negative in all of them. PCR for T. pallidum ssp pertenue was negative in all children, but Haemophilus ducreyi DNA was detected in 9 lesions. In these communities, previously treated for trachoma, we found no evidence of ongoing transmission of yaws. H. ducreyi was associated with a proportion of skin lesions, but the majority of lesions remain unexplained. Integration of diagnostic testing into both pre and post-MDA surveillance systems is required to better inform yaws control programmes.","[Ghinai, Rosanna; Solomon, Anthony W.; Bailey, Robin L.; Mabey, David C.

Optical diagnostic imaging has demonstrated that murine respiratory disease models are subject to significant upper respiratory tract (URT) colonization. Because human melioidosis is not associated with URT colonization as a prominent presentation, we hypothesized that lung-specific delivery of B. pseudomallei may enhance our ability to study respiratory melioidosis in mice. We compared intranasal and intubation-mediated intratracheal (IMIT) instillation of bacteria and found that the absence of URT colonization correlates with an increased bacterial pneumonia and systemic disease progression. Comparison of the LD50 of luminescent B. pseudomallei strain, JW280, in intranasal and IMIT challenges of albino C57BL/6J mice identified a significant decrease in the LD50 using IMIT. We subsequently examined the LD50 of both capsular polysaccharide and Type 3 Secretion System cluster 3 (T3SS3) mutants by IMIT challenge of mice and found that the capsule mutant was attenuated 6.8 fold, while the T3SS3 mutant was attenuated 290 fold, demonstrating that T3SS3 is critical to respiratory melioidosis. Our previously reported intranasal challenge studies, which involve significant URT colonization, did not identify a dissemination defect for capsule mutants; however, we now report that capsule mutants exhibit significantly reduced dissemination from the lung following lung-specific instillation, suggesting that capsule mutants are competent to spread from the URT, but not the lung. We also report that a T3SS3 mutant is defective for dissemination following lung-specific delivery, and also exhibits in vivo growth defects in the lung. These findings highlight the T3SS3 as a critical virulence system for respiratory melioidosis, not only in the lung, but also for subsequent spread beyond the lung using a model system uniquely capable to characterize the fate of lung-delivered pathogen.","[Gutierrez, Maria G.; Pfeffer, Tia L.; Warawa, Jonathan M.] Univ Louisville, Dept Microbiol & Immunol, Louisville, KY 40292 USA; [Warawa, Jonathan M.] Univ Louisville, Ctr Predict Med, Louisville, KY 40292 USA","Warawa, JM (reprint author), Univ Louisville, Dept Microbiol & Immunol, Louisville, KY 40292 USA.",jonathan.warawa@louisville.edu,,,University of Louisville Office of the Executive Vice President for Research,"These studies were funded in part by an Intramural Research Incentive Grant by the University of Louisville Office of the Executive Vice President for Research.

Antivenom is effective in reducing mortality and remains the mainstay of therapy. This study aimed to determine the cost-effectiveness of using effective antivenoms for Snakebite envenoming in Nigeria. Methodology: Economic analysis was conducted from a public healthcare system perspective. Estimates of model inputs were obtained from the literature. Incremental Cost Effectiveness Ratios (ICERs) were quantified as deaths and Disability-Adjusted-Life-Years (DALY) averted from antivenom therapy. A decision analytic model was developed and analyzed with the following model base-case parameter estimates: type of snakes causing bites, antivenom effectiveness to prevent death, untreated mortality, risk of Early Adverse Reactions (EAR), mortality risk from EAR, mean age at bite and remaining life expectancy, and disability risk (amputation). End-user costs applied included: costs of diagnosing and monitoring envenoming, antivenom drug cost, supportive care, shipping/freezing antivenom, transportation to-and-from hospital and feeding costs while on admission, management of antivenom EAR and free alternative snakebite care for ineffective antivenom. Principal Findings: We calculated a cost/death averted of ($2330.16) and cost/DALY averted of $99.61 discounted and $56.88 undiscounted. Varying antivenom effectiveness through the 95% confidence interval from 55% to 86% yield a cost/DALY averted of $137.02 to $86.61 respectively. Similarly, varying the prevalence of envenoming caused by carpet viper from 0% to 96% yield a cost/DALY averted of $254.18 to $78.25 respectively. More effective antivenoms and carpet viper envenoming rather than non-carpet viper envenoming were associated with lower cost/DALY averted. Conclusions/Significance: Treatment of snakebite envenoming in Nigeria is cost-effective with a cost/death averted of $2330.16 and cost/DALY averted of $99.61 discounted, lower than the country's gross domestic product per capita of $1555 (2013).

However, biological details of intestinal cell functions remain obscure, as do the proteins and molecular functions located on the apical intestinal membrane (AIM), and within the intestinal lumen (IL) of nematodes. Accordingly, methods were developed to gain a comprehensive identification of peptidases that function in the intestinal tract of adult female Ascaris suum. Peptidase activity was detected in multiple fractions of the A. suum intestine under pH conditions ranging from 5.0 to 8.0. Peptidase class inhibitors were used to characterize these activities. The fractions included whole lysates, membrane enriched fractions, and physiological-and 4 molar urea-perfusates of the intestinal lumen. Concanavalin A (ConA) was confirmed to bind to the AIM, and intestinal proteins affinity isolated on ConA-beads were compared to proteins from membrane and perfusate fractions by mass spectrometry. Twenty-nine predicted peptidases were identified including aspartic, cysteine, and serine peptidases, and an unexpectedly high number (16) of metallopeptidases. Many of these proteins co-localized to multiple fractions, providing independent support for localization to specific intestinal compartments, including the IL and AIM. This unique perfusion model produced the most comprehensive view of likely digestive peptidases that function in these intestinal compartments of A. suum, or any nematode. This model offers a means to directly determine functions of these proteins in the A. suum intestine and, more generally, deduce the wide array functions that exist in these cellular compartments of the nematode intestine.","[Jasmer, Douglas P.] Washington State Univ, Dept Vet Microbiol & Pathol, Pullman, WA 99164 USA; [Rosa, Bruce A.; Mitreva, Makedonka] Washington Univ, Sch Med, Genome Inst, St Louis, MO USA; [Mitreva, Makedonka] Washington Univ, Sch Med, Dept Med, St Louis, MO 63110 USA; [Mitreva, Makedonka] Washington Univ, Sch Med, Dept Genet, St Louis, MO 63110 USA","Jasmer, DP (reprint author), Washington State Univ, Dept Vet Microbiol & Pathol, Pullman, WA 99164 USA.",djasmer@vetmed.wsu.edu,,"Mitreva, Makedonka/0000-0001-9572-3436",NHGMS [GM097435],"The research was supported by NHGMS grant GM097435 to MM, and a subcontract from that grant to DPJ.

As clinical symptoms of CHIKV infections are similar to several flavivirus infections, good detection methods to identify CHIKV infection are desired for improved treatment and clinical management. The strength of anti-E2EP3 antibody responses was explored in a longitudinal study on 38 CHIKV-infected patients. We compared their anti-E2EP3 responses with those of patients infected with non-CHIKV alphaviruses, or flaviviruses. E2EP3 cross-reactive samples from patients infected with non-CHIKV viruses were further analyzed with an in vitro CHIKV neutralization assay. CHIKV-specific anti-E2EP3 antibody responses were detected in 72% to 100% of patients. Serum samples from patients infected with other non-CHIKV alphaviruses were cross-reactive to E2EP3. Interestingly, some of these antibodies demonstrated clearly in vitro CHIKV neutralizing activity. Contrastingly, serum samples from flaviviruses-infected patients showed a low level of cross-reactivity against E2EP3. Using CHIKV E2EP3 as a serology marker not only allows early detection of CHIKV specific antibodies, but would also allow the differentiation between CHIKV infections and flavivirus infections with 93% accuracy, thereby allowing precise acute febrile diagnosis and improving clinical management in regions newly suffering from CHIKV outbreaks including the Americas.","[Kam, Yiu-Wing; Eng, Kai Er; Lee, Wendy W.

Since disease pathogenesis is associated with host inflammatory reactions, we investigated whether Th17 responses could be related to aggravated pathology in HO. Using flow cytometry, filarial-specific cytokine responses and PCR arrays, we compared the immune cell profiles, including Th subsets, in individuals presenting the two polar forms of infection and endemic normals (EN). In addition to elevated frequencies of memory CD4(+) T cells, individuals with HO showed accentuated Th17 and Th2 profiles but decreased CD4(+)CD25(hi)Foxp3(+) regulatory T cells. These profiles included increased IL-17A(+), IL-4(+), RORC2(+) and GATA3(+)CD4(+) T cell populations. Flow cytometry data was further confirmed using a PCR array since Th17-related genes (IL-17 family members, IL-6, IL-1 beta and IL-22) and Th2-related (IL-4, IL-13, STAT6) genes were all significantly up-regulated in HO individuals. In addition, stronger Onchocerca volvulus-specific Th2 responses, especially IL-13, were observed in vitro in hyperreactive individuals when compared to GEO or EN groups. This study provides initial evidence that elevated frequencies of Th17 and Th2 cells form part of the immune network instigating the development of severe onchocerciasis.","[Katawa, Gnatoulma; Layland, Laura E.; von Horn, Charlotte; Kwarteng, Alexander; Arriens, Sandra; Hoerauf, Achim; Adjobimey, Tomabu] Univ Hosp Bonn, IMMIP, Bonn, Germany; [Katawa, Gnatoulma] Univ Lome, Adv Sch Med Biol & Food Technol ESTBA, Lome, Togo; [Debrah, Alex Y.; Batsa, Linda] Kumasi Ctr Collaborat Res Trop Med KCCR, Kumasi, Ghana; [Debrah, Alex Y.] Kwame Nkrumah Univ Sci & Technol, Fac Allied Hlth Sci, Kumasi, Ghana; [Debrah, Alex Y.] Kwame Nkrumah Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Med Sci, Kumasi, Ghana; [Taylor, David W.] Univ Edinburgh, Inst Immunol & Infect Res, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland","Katawa, G (reprint author), Univ Hosp Bonn, IMMIP, Bonn, Germany.",hoerauf@microbiology-bonn.de,"Adjobimey, Tomabu/I-4724-2019","Adjobimey, Tomabu/0000-0002-4353-2897; KWARTENG, ALEXANDER/0000-0002-0893-2908","German Research Council [DFG Ho2009/8-2]; European Commission [242121]; BONFOR intramural funding program of the Medical Faculty of Bonn University; European Foundation Initiative into African Research in Neglected Tropical diseases (EFINTD) [1/81995, 86 52]; German Academic Exchange Committee (DAAD); DFG [HO 2009/10-1]","This work was primarily supported through a grant from the German Research Council (DFG Ho2009/8-2).

Prevalence and factors associated with abnormal renal function among HIV-infected children in Africa compared to uninfected controls have not been well described in a schistosomiasis endemic area. Methodology/Principal Findings This cross-sectional study was conducted at the Sekou Toure Regional Hospital HIV clinic in Mwanza, Tanzania. A total of 122 HIV-infected children and 122 HIV-uninfected siblings were consecutively enrolled. Fresh urine was obtained for measurement of albuminuria and Schistosoma circulating cathodic antigen. Blood was collected for measurement of serum creatinine. Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was calculated using the modified Schwartz equation. Renal dysfunction was defined operationally as eGFR<60mL/min/1.73m2 and/or albuminuria>20mg/L in a single sample. Among 122 HIV-infected children, 61/122 (50.0%) met our criteria for renal dysfunction: 54/122 (44.3%) had albuminuria>20mg/L and 9/122 (7.4%) had eGFR<60. Among 122 HIV-uninfected children, 51/122 (41.8%) met our criteria for renal dysfunction: 48/122 (39.3%) had albuminuria>20mg/L and 6/122 (4.9%) had eGFR<60. Schistosomiasis was the only factor significantly associated with renal dysfunction by multivariable logistic regression (OR = 2.51, 95% CI 1.46-4.31, p = 0.001). Conclusions/Significance A high prevalence of renal dysfunction exists among both HIV-infected Tanzanian children and their HIV-uninfected siblings.

Pyrethroid insecticides have emerged as a preferred choice for vector control but are threatened by the emergence of resistance. The present study reports a focus of pyrethroid resistance and presence of two kdr mutations-F1534C and a novel mutation T1520I, in Ae. aegypti from Delhi, India. Methodology/Principal Findings: Insecticide susceptibility status of adult-female Ae. aegypti against DDT (4%), deltamethrin (0.05%) and permethrin (0.75%) was determined using WHO's standard insecticide susceptibility kit, which revealed resistance to DDT, deltamethrin and permethrin with corrected mortalities of 35%, 72% and 76% respectively. Mosquitoes were screened for the presence of kdr mutations including those reported earlier (I1011V/M, V1016G/I, F1534C, D1794Y and S989P), which revealed the presence of F1534C and a novel mutation T1520I. Highly specific PCR-RFLP assays were developed for genotyping of these two mutations. Genotyping using allele specific PCR and new PCR-RFLP assays revealed a high frequency of F1534C (0.41-0.79) and low frequency of novel mutation T1520I (0.13). The latter was observed to be tightly linked with F1534C and possibly serve as a compensatory mutation. A positive association of F1534C mutation with DDT and deltamethrin resistance in Ae. aegypti was established. However, F1534C-kdr did not show significant protection against permethrin. Conclusions/Significance: The Aedes aegypti population of Delhi is resistant to DDT, deltamethrin and permethrin. Two kdr mutations, F1534C and a novel mutation T1520I, were identified in this population. This is the first report of kdr mutations being present in the Indian Ae. aegypti population. Highly specific PCR-RFLP assays were developed for discrimination of alleles at both kdr loci.

Praziquantel, developed in the 1970s, has high efficacy, excellent tolerability, few and transient side effects, simple administration procedures and competitive cost and it is currently the only recommended drug for treatment of human schistosomiasis. The use of a single drug to treat a population of over 200 million infected people appears particularly alarming when considering the threat of drug resistance. Quantitative, objective and validated methods for the screening of compound collections are needed for the discovery of novel anti-schistosomal drugs. Methodology/Principal Findings The present work describes the development and validation of a luminescence-based, medium-throughput assay for the detection of schistosomula viability through quantitation of ATP, a good indicator of metabolically active cells in culture. This validated method is demonstrated to be fast, highly reliable, sensitive and automation-friendly. The optimized assay was used for the screening of a small compound library on S. mansoni schistosomula, showing that the proposed method is suitable for a medium-throughput semi-automated screening. Interestingly, the pilot screening identified hits previously reported to have some anti-parasitic activity, further supporting the validity of this assay for anthelminthic drug discovery. Conclusions The developed and validated schistosomula viability luminescence-based assay was shown to be successful and suitable for the identification of novel compounds potentially exploitable in future schistosomiasis therapies.","[Lalli, Cristiana; Guidi, Alessandra; Ruberti, Giovina] CNR, Inst Cell Biol & Neurobiol, Rome, Italy; [Gennari, Nadia; Altamura, Sergio; Bresciani, Alberto] Univ Roma Tor Vergata, Dept Biol, I-00173 Rome, Italy","Lalli, C (reprint author), CNR, Inst Cell Biol & Neurobiol, Campus A Buzzati Traverso, Rome, Italy.",a.bresciani@irbm.it; gruberti@ibc.cnr.it,"Guidi, Alessandra/P-1348-2018","Bresciani, Alberto/0000-0003-4491-603X; RUBERTI, Giovina/0000-0003-2367-9709",CNR (National Research Council)-CNCCS (Collezione Nazionale di Composti Chimici e Centro di screening),"This work was partially supported by the CNR (National Research Council)-CNCCS (Collezione Nazionale di Composti Chimici e Centro di screening) Project ""Rare, Neglected and Poverty Related Diseases-Schistosomiasis-Innovative drugs discovery"".

With infections such as Lassa fever (LF), an often fatal, rodent-borne, hemorrhagic fever common in areas of West Africa, rodent-to-rodent, rodent-to-human, human-to-human and even human-to-rodent transmission patterns are possible. Indeed, large hospital-related outbreaks have been reported. Estimating the proportion of transmission due to human-to-human routes and related patterns (e.g. existence of super-spreaders), in these scenarios is challenging, but essential for planned interventions. Methodology/Principal Findings: Here, we make use of an innovative modeling approach to analyze data from published outbreaks and the number of LF hospitalized patients to Kenema Government Hospital in Sierra Leone to estimate the likely contribution of human-to-human transmission. The analyses show that almost 20% of the cases at KGH are secondary cases arising from human-to-human transmission. However, we found much of this transmission is associated with a disproportionally large impact of a few individuals ('super-spreaders'), as we found only 5% of human cases result in an effective reproduction number (i.e. the average number of secondary cases per infectious case) >1, with a maximum value up to 12. Conclusions/Significance: This work explains the discrepancy between the sizes of reported LF outbreaks and a clinical perception that human-to-human transmission is low. Future assessment of risks of LF and infection control guidelines should take into account the potentially large impact of super-spreaders in human-to-human transmission. Our work highlights several neglected topics in LF research, the occurrence and nature of super-spreading events and aspects of social behavior in transmission and detection.","[Lo Iacono, Giovanni; Wood, James L.

Knowing the areas where cholera is known to occur and the factors that lead to its occurrence will assist in planning preventive measures and disaster mitigation. Methods: Using sentinel surveillance data, PubMed and ProMED searches covering information from 2008-2013 and event-based surveillance reports from 2010-2013, we assessed the epidemiology of cholera in the Philippines. Using spatial log regression, we assessed the role of water, sanitation and population density on the incidence of cholera. Results and Discussion: We identified 12 articles from ProMED and none from PubMed that reported on cholera in the Philippines from 2008 to 2013. Data from ProMed and surveillance revealed 42,071 suspected and confirmed cholera cases reported from 2008 to 2013, among which only 5,006 were confirmed. 38 (47%) of 81 provinces and metropolitan regions reported at least one confirmed case of cholera and 32 (40%) reported at least one suspected case. The overall case fatality ratio in sentinel sites was 0.62%, but was 2% in outbreaks. All age groups were affected. Using both confirmed and suspected cholera cases, the average annual incidence in 2010-2013 was 9.1 per 100,000 population. Poor access to improved sanitation was consistently associated with higher cholera incidence. Paradoxically, access to improved water sources was associated with higher cholera incidence using both suspected and confirmed cholera data sources. This finding may have been due to the breakdown in the infrastructure and non-chlorination of water supplies, emphasizing the need to maintain public water systems. Conclusion: Our findings confirm that cholera affects a large proportion of the provinces in the country. Identifying areas most at risk for cholera will support the development and implementation of policies to minimize the morbidity and mortality due to this disease.","[Lopez, Anna Lena; Ylade, Michelle] Univ Philippines, Manila Natl Inst Hlth, Quezon City 1101, Philippines; [Macasaet, Lino Y.; Tayag, Enrique A.] Dept Hlth, Manila, Philippines; [Ali, Mohammad] Johns Hopkins Bloomberg Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Int Hlth, Baltimore, MD USA","Lopez, AL (reprint author), Univ Philippines, Manila Natl Inst Hlth, Quezon City 1101, Philippines.",annalenalopez@gmail.com,"Ali, Mohammad/E-2365-2017","Ali, Mohammad/0000-0003-1410-388X",University of the Philippines Manila-National Institutes of Health [NIH 2012-024]; Delivering Oral Vaccines Effectively (DOVE) Project - Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation,"This study was funded by the University of the Philippines Manila-National Institutes of Health (NIH 2012-024).

Trypanosomatids, including the agent of African sleeping sickness namely Trypanosoma brucei, have a type B ribose-5-phosphate isomerase. This enzyme is absent from humans, which have a structurally unrelated ribose 5-phosphate isomerase type A, and therefore has been proposed as an attractive drug target waiting further characterization. In this study, Trypanosoma brucei ribose 5-phosphate isomerase B showed in vitro isomerase activity. RNAi against this enzyme reduced parasites' in vitro growth, and more importantly, bloodstream forms infectivity. Mice infected with induced RNAi clones exhibited lower parasitaemia and a prolonged survival compared to control mice. Phenotypic reversion was achieved by complementing induced RNAi clones with an ectopic copy of Trypanosoma cruzi gene. Our results present the first functional characterization of Trypanosoma brucei ribose 5-phosphate isomerase B, and show the relevance of an enzyme belonging to the non-oxidative branch of the pentose phosphate pathway in the context of Trypanosoma brucei infection.","[Loureiro, Ines; Faria, Joana; Santarem, Nuno; Cordeiro-da-Siva, Anabela; Tavares, Joana] Univ Porto, Inst Mol & Cellular Biol, Parasite Dis Grp, P-4100 Oporto, Portugal; [Clayton, Christine] Heidelberg Univ, Zentrum Mol Biol, DKFZ ZMBH Cv Alliance, Heidelberg, Germany; [Santarem, Nuno] Univ Porto, Inst Mol & Cellular Biol, Prot Crystallog Grp, P-4100 Oporto, Portugal; [Roy, Nilanjan] Ashok & Rita Patel Inst Integrated Study & Res Bi, Anand, Gujarat, India; [Cordeiro-da-Siva, Anabela] Univ Porto, Faculdade Farmacia, Dept Ciencias Biol, P-4100 Oporto, Portugal","Loureiro, I (reprint author), Univ Porto, Inst Mol & Cellular Biol, Parasite Dis Grp, Rua Campo Alegre 823, P-4100 Oporto, Portugal.",cordeiro@ibmc.up.pt; jtavares@ibmc.up.pt,"Tavares, Joana PC/J-7395-2013; Ribeiro, Sandra Macedo/D-9258-2011; Santarem, Nuno/J-8156-2013","Tavares, Joana PC/0000-0003-0391-2622; Ribeiro, Sandra Macedo/0000-0002-7698-1170; Roy, Nilanjan/0000-0001-8788-7350; Faria, Joana/0000-0001-6274-8143; Santarem, Nuno/0000-0003-4973-9933","European Community [602773]; FEDER funds through the Operational Competitiveness Program - COMPETE; National Funds through FCT - Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia [PEst-C/SAU/LA0002/2011]; FCT [SFRH/BD/64528/2009, SFRH/BD/79712/2011]; National funds through FCT; European Social Fund within the Human Potential Operating Programme","This work was funded by the European Community's Seventh Framework Programme under grant agreement No. 602773 (Project KINDRED).

Manifestations of ATL are diverse and different clinical types with different tissue involvement and aggressiveness have been described. The mechanisms that lead to the development of ATL clinical types have not yet been clarified. Considering that in ATL patients HTLV-1 infection generally occurs in childhood, a multistep carcinogenesis model has been proposed. Microsatellite alterations are important genetic events in cancer development and these alterations have been reported in the aggressive types of ATL. Little is known about oncogenesis of the less aggressive types. Methodology/Principal Findings In this study we investigated the role of the microsatellite alterations in the pathogenesis mediated by HTLV-1 in the different types of ATL. We examined the presence of microsatellite instability (MSI) and loss of heterozigosity (LOH) in matched pair samples (tumoral and normal) of 24 patients with less aggressive types (smoldering and chronic) and in aggressive types (acute and lymphoma) of ATL. Four microsatellite markers D10S190, D10S191, D1391 and DCC were analyzed. MSI was found in four patients, three smoldering and one chronic, and LOH in four patients, three smoldering and one acute. None of the smoldering patients with microsatellite alterations progressed to aggressive ATL. Conclusions/Significance To our knowledge, this is the first report describing the presence of MSI and LOH in the less aggressive types of ATL. These results indicate that microsatellite alterations may participate in the development of the less aggressive types of ATL.","[Magalhaes, Marcelo; Farre, Lourdes] Oswaldo Cruz Fdn CPQGM FIOCRUZ, Goncalo Moniz Res Ctr, Lab Expt Pathol LAPEX, Salvador, BA, Brazil; [Oliveira, Pedro D.] Univ Fed Bahia, Complexo Hosp Univ Prof Edgard Santos, Dept Dermatol, Salvador, BA, Brazil; [Bittencourt, Achilea L.] Univ Fed Bahia, Complexo Hosp Univ Prof Edgard Santos, Dept Pathol, Salvador, BA, Brazil; [Farre, Lourdes] Natl Inst Sci & Technol Trop Dis INCT DT, Salvador, BA, Brazil","Magalhaes, M (reprint author), Oswaldo Cruz Fdn CPQGM FIOCRUZ, Goncalo Moniz Res Ctr, Lab Expt Pathol LAPEX, Salvador, BA, Brazil.",Lfarre@bahia.fiocruz.br,"Oliveira, Pedro/G-3893-2012","Oliveira, Pedro/0000-0001-8478-7135; Farre, Lourdes/0000-0002-3168-1940",Conselho Nacional de Pesquisa (CNPq) [301509/2010-7]; Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado da Bahia (FAPESB) [ppp0010/2011],"This study was supported by the Conselho Nacional de Pesquisa (CNPq, www.cnpq.br, 301509/2010-7) and Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado da Bahia (FAPESB, www.fapesb.ba.gov.br, ppp0010/2011).

This approach relies on adult mosquito behavior to spread larvicide to breeding sites at levels that are lethal to immature mosquitoes. Prior studies demonstrate that 'dissemination stations,' deployed in mosquito-infested areas, can contaminate adult mosquitoes, which subsequently deliver the larvicide to breeding sites. In some situations, however, preventative measures are needed, e.g., to mitigate seasonal population increases. Here we examine a novel approach that combines elements of autocidal and auto-dissemination strategies by releasing artificially reared, male mosquitoes that are contaminated with an insecticide. Methodology Laboratory and field experiments examine for model-predicted impacts of pyriproxyfen (PPF) directly applied to adult male Aedes albopictus, including (1) the ability of PPF-treated males to cross-contaminate females and to (2) deliver PPF to breeding sites. Principal Findings Similar survivorship was observed in comparisons of PPF-treated and untreated males. Males contaminated both female adults and oviposition containers in field cage tests, at levels that eliminated immature survivorship. Field trials demonstrate an ability of PPF-treated males to transmit lethal doses to introduced oviposition containers, both in the presence and absence of indigenous females. A decline in the Ae. albopictus population was observed following the introduction of PPF-treated males, which was not observed in two untreated field sites. Conclusions/Significance The results demonstrate that, in cage and open field trials, adult male Ae. albopictus can tolerate PPF and contaminate, either directly or indirectly, adult females and immature breeding sites. The results support additional development of the proposed approach, in which male mosquitoes act as vehicles for insecticide delivery, including exploration of the approach with additional medically important mosquito species. The novelty and importance of this approach is an ability to safely achieve auto-dissemination at levels of intensity that may not be possible with an auto-dissemination approach that is based on indigenous females. Specifically, artificially-reared males can be released and sustained at any density required, so that the potential for impact is limited only by the practical logistics of mosquito rearing and release, rather than natural population densities and the self-limiting impact of an intervention upon them.","[Mains, James W.; Brelsfoard, Corey L.; Dobson, Stephen L.] MosquitoMate Inc, Lexington, KY 40505 USA","Mains, JW (reprint author), MosquitoMate Inc, Lexington, KY 40505 USA.",sdobson@mosquitomate.com,,,,,,50,10,10,0,14,PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE,SAN FRANCISCO,"1160 BATTERY STREET, STE 100, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94111 USA",1935-2735,,,PLOS NEGLECT TROP D,Plos Neglect.

We investigated whether prenatal exposure to malaria and/or helminths affects the pattern of infant immune responses to standard vaccinations against Haemophilus influenzae (Hib), diphtheria (DT), hepatitis B (Hep B) and tetanus toxoid (TT). Methods and Findings 450 Kenyan women were tested for malaria, schistosomiasis, lymphatic filariasis (LF), and intestinal helminths during pregnancy. After three standard vaccinations at 6, 10 and 14 weeks, their newborns were followed biannually to age 36 months and tested for absolute levels of IgG against Hib, DT, Hep B, and TT at each time point. Newborns' cord blood (CB) lymphocyte responses to malaria blood-stage antigens, soluble Schistosoma haematobium worm antigen (SWAP), and filaria antigen (BMA) were also assessed. Three immunophenotype categories were compared: i) tolerant (those having Plasmodium-, Schistosoma-, or Wuchereria-infected mothers but lacking respective Th1/Th2-type recall responses at birth to malaria antigens, SWAP, or BMA); ii) sensitized (those with infected/uninfected mothers and detectable Th1/Th2-type CB recall response to respective parasite antigen); or iii) unexposed (no evidence of maternal infection or CB recall response). Overall, 78.9% of mothers were infected with LF (44.7%), schistosomiasis (32.4%), malaria (27.6%) or hookworm (33.8%). Antenatal maternal malaria, LF, and hookworm were independently associated with significantly lower Hib-specific IgG. Presence of multiple maternal infections was associated with lower infant IgG levels against Hib and DT antigens post-vaccination. Post-vaccination IgG levels were also significantly associated with immunophenotype: malaria-tolerized infants had reduced response to DT, whereas filariatolerized infants showed reduced response to Hib. Conclusions There is an impaired ability to develop IgG antibody responses to key protective antigens of Hib and diphtheria in infants of mothers infected with malaria and/or helminths during pregnancy. These findings highlight the importance of control and prevention of parasitic infections among pregnant women.","[Malhotra, Indu; McKibben, Maxim; McKibben, Elisabeth; Sutherland, Laura J.; King, Charles H.; King, Christopher L.; LaBeaud, A.

Memory CD8+ T cells can be categorised based on their distinct differentiation stages and functional activities as follows: stem cell memory (TSCM), central memory (TCM), transitional memory (TTM), effector memory (TEM) and terminal effector (TTE) cells. Currently, the immune mechanisms that control T. cruzi in the chronic phase of the infection are unknown. Methodology/Principal Findings: To characterise the CD8+ T cell subsets that could be participating in the control of T. cruzi infection, in this study, we compared total and T. cruzi-specific circulating CD8+ T cells with distinctive phenotypic and functional features in chronic chagasic patients (CCPs) with different degrees of cardiac dysfunction. We observed a decreased frequency of total TSCM along with an increased frequency of TTE in CCPs with severe disease. Antigen-specific TSCM cells were not detectable in CCPs with severe forms of the disease. A functional profile of CD8+ T cell subsets among CCPs revealed a high frequency of monofunctional CD8+ T cells in the most severe patients with IFN-gamma+-or TNF-alpha+-producing cells. Conclusions/Significance: These findings suggest that CD8+ TSCM cells may be associated with the immune response to T. cruzi and outcome of Chagas disease, given that these cells may be involved in repopulating the T cell pool that controls infection.","[Mateus, Jose; Lasso, Paola; Cuellar, Adriana] Pontificia Univ Javeriana, Grp Inmunobiol & Biol Celular, Bogota, Colombia; [Mateus, Jose; Lasso, Paola; Pavia, Paula; Puerta, Concepcion J.] Pontificia Univ Javeriana, Fac Ciencias, Mol Parasitol Lab, Bogota, Colombia; [Rosas, Fernando] Fdn Clin Abood Shaio, Bogota, Colombia; [Roa, Nubia] Pontificia Univ Javeriana, Fac Med, Bogota, Colombia; [Andres Valencia-Hernandez, Carlos] Inst Nacl Salud, Parasitol Lab, Bogota, Colombia; [Mario Gonzalez, John] Univ Los Andes, Fac Med, Grp Ciencias Basicas Med, Bogota, Colombia","Mateus, J (reprint author), Pontificia Univ Javeriana, Grp Inmunobiol & Biol Celular, Bogota, Colombia.",acuellar@javeriana.edu.co,,"zaky, mohammad/0000-0003-3547-2588; Cuellar, Adriana/0000-0003-0834-8442; Puerta Bula, Concepcion Judith/0000-0002-3449-3961","Pontificia Universidad Javeriana [PUJ] [PROP. 4540, PROY. 4325]","This work belongs to the project ""Identificacion de celulas T stem cell memory (TSCM) CD8+en pacientes chagasicos"", funded by Pontificia Universidad Javeriana [PUJ ID PROP. 4540; ID PROY. 4325].

Another important step in the control of visceral leishmaniasis is the identification of infected dogs, which are the main domestic reservoir of L. infantum. Recombinant proteins and synthetic peptides based on Leishmania genes have emerged as valuable targets for serodiagnosis due to their increased sensitivity, specificity and potential for standardization. Cathepsin L-like genes are surface antigens that are secreted by amastigotes and have little similarity to host proteins, factors that enable this protein as a good target for serodiagnosis of the leishmaniasis. Methodology/Principal Findings: We mapped a linear B-cell epitope within the Cathepsin L-like protein from L. braziliensis. A synthetic peptide containing the epitope and the recombinant protein was evaluated for serodiagnosis of human tegumentary and visceral leishmaniasis, as well as canine visceral leishmaniasis. Conclusions/Significance: The recombinant protein performed best for human tegumentary and canine visceral leishmaniasis, with 96.30% and 89.33% accuracy, respectively. The synthetic peptide was the best to discriminate human visceral leishmaniasis, with 97.14% specificity, 94.55% sensitivity and 96.00% accuracy. Comparison with T. cruzi-infected humans and dogs suggests that the identified epitope is specific to Leishmania parasites, which minimizes the likelihood of cross-reactions.","[Menezes-Souza, Daniel; de Oliveira Mendes, Tiago Antonio; Bartholomeu, Daniella Castanheira; Fujiwara, Ricardo Toshio] Univ Fed Minas Gerais, Dept Parasitol, Inst Ciencias Biol, Belo Horizonte, MG, Brazil; [Gomes, Matheus de Souza] Univ Fed Uberlandia, Inst Gen Bioquim, Patos de Minas, Brazil","Fujiwara, RT (reprint author), Univ Fed Minas Gerais, Dept Parasitol, Inst Ciencias Biol, Belo Horizonte, MG, Brazil.",fujiwara@icb.ufmg.br,"Bartholomeu, Daniella/J-4714-2015; Fujiwara, Ricardo Toshio/J-7579-2012; de Souza Gomes, Matheus/G-3480-2012; Menezes-Souza, Daniel/N-7389-2014","Bartholomeu, Daniella/0000-0003-0974-7357; Fujiwara, Ricardo Toshio/0000-0002-4713-575X; de Souza Gomes, Matheus/0000-0001-7352-3089; Mendes, Tiago Antonio de Oliveira/0000-0002-5569-4893",FAPEMIG; CNPq; Pro-Reitoria de Pesquisa/UFMG,"The authors received funding from FAPEMIG, CNPq and Pro-Reitoria de Pesquisa/UFMG.

Although P. ovale subspecies are similar based on morphology and geographical distribution, allelic differences indicate that P. ovale curtisi and P. ovale wallikeri are genetically divergent. Additionally, potential clinical and latency duration differences between P. ovale curtisi and P. ovale wallikeri demonstrate the need for investigation into the contribution of this neglected malaria parasite to the global malaria burden. Methods In order to detect all P. ovale subspecies simultaneously, we developed an inclusive P. ovale-specific real-time PCR assay based on conserved regions between P. ovale curtisi and P. ovale wallikeri in the reticulocyte binding protein 2 (rbp2) gene. Additionally, we characterized the P. ovale subspecies prevalence from 22 asymptomatic malaria infections using multilocus genotyping to discriminate P. ovale curtisi and P. ovale wallikeri. Results Our P. ovale rbp2 qPCR assay validation experiments demonstrated a linear dynamic range from 6.25 rbp2 plasmid copies/microliter to 100,000 rbp2 plasmid copies/microliter and a limit of detection of 1.5 rbp2 plasmid copies/microliter. Specificity experiments showed the ability of the rbp2 qPCR assay to detect low-levels of P. ovale in the presence of additional malaria parasite species, including P. falciparum, P. vivax, and P. malariae. We identified P. ovale curtisi and P. ovale wallikeri in Western Kenya by DNA sequencing of the tryptophan-rich antigen gene, the small subunit ribosomal RNA gene, and the rbp2 gene. Conclusions Our novel P. ovale rbp2 qPCR assay detects P. ovale curtisi and P. ovale wallikeri simultaneously and can be utilized to characterize the prevalence, distribution, and burden of P. ovale in malaria endemic regions. Using multilocus genotyping, we also provided the first description of the prevalence of P. ovale curtisi and P. ovale wallikeri in Western Kenya, a region holoendemic for malaria transmission.","[Miller, Robin H.; Stewart, V.

Ecological and transmission studies suggest Variable Number Tandem Repeat (VNTR) typing as a useful tool to differentiate MU strains from other Mycolactone Producing Mycobacteria (MPM). Deciphering the genetic relatedness of clinical and environmental isolates is seminal to determining reservoirs, vectors and transmission routes. In this study, we attempted to source-track MU infections to specific water bodies by matching VNTR profiles of MU in human samples to those in the environment. Environmental samples were collected from 10 water bodies in four BU endemic communities in the Ashanti region, Ghana. Four VNTR loci in MU Agy99 genome, were used to genotype environmental MU ecovars, and those from 14 confirmed BU patients within the same study area. Length polymorphism was confirmed with sequencing. MU was present in the 3 different types of water bodies, but significantly higher in biofilm samples. Four MU genotypes, designatedW, X, Y and Z, were typed in both human and environmental samples. Other reported genotypes were only found in water bodies. Animal trapping identified 1 mouse with lesion characteristic of BU, which was confirmed as MU infection. Our findings suggest that patients may have been infected from community associated water bodies. Further, we present evidence that small mammals within endemic communities could be susceptible to MU infections. M. ulcerans transmission could involve several routes where humans have contact with risk environments, which may be further compounded by water bodies acting as vehicles for disseminating strains.","[Narh, Charles A.; Quaye, Charles; de Souza, Dziedzom K.; Boakye, Daniel A.] Univ Ghana, Noguchi Mem Inst Med Res, Dept Parasitol, Legon, Ghana; [Narh, Charles A.; Mosi, Lydia; Quaye, Charles; Dassi, Christelle; Konan, Daniele O.; Bonfoh, Bassirou] Ctr Suisse Recherches Scientifiques Cote Ivoire, Adiopodume, Cote Ivoire; [Narh, Charles A.; Tay, Samuel C.

Even though the BCG vaccine is still widely used, results on its effectiveness in preventing mycobacterial diseases are partially contradictory, especially regarding Buruli Ulcer Disease (BUD). The aim of this case-control study is to evaluate the possible protective effect of BCG vaccination on BUD. Methodology: The present study was performed in three different countries and sites where BUD is endemic: in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ghana, and Togo from 2010 through 2013. The large study population was comprised of 401 cases with laboratory confirmed BUD and 826 controls, mostly family members or neighbors. Principal Findings: After stratification by the three countries, two sexes and four age groups, no significant correlation was found between the presence of BCG scar and BUD status of individuals. Multivariate analysis has shown that the independent variables country (p = 0.31), sex (p = 0.24), age (p = 0.96), and presence of a BCG scar (p = 0.07) did not significantly influence the development of BUD category I or category II/III. Furthermore, the status of BCG vaccination was also not significantly related to duration of BUD or time to healing of lesions. Conclusions: In our study, we did not observe significant evidence of a protective effect of routine BCG vaccination on the risk of developing either BUD or severe forms of BUD. Since accurate data on BCG strains used in these three countries were not available, no final conclusion can be drawn on the effectiveness of BCG strain in protecting against BUD. As has been suggested for tuberculosis and leprosy, well-designed prospective studies on different existing BCG vaccine strains are needed also for BUD.","[Phillips, Richard Odame; Sarfo, Fred Stephen; Amoako, Yaw; Adjei, Ohene] Kwame Nkrumah Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Med Sci, Dept Med, Kumasi, Ghana; [Phanzu, Delphin Mavinga; Luzolo, Elysee Kalundieko] Inst Med Evangel IME Kimpese, Projet Ulcere Buruli, Kimpese, DEM REP CONGO; [Beissner, Marcus; Nitschke, Joerg; Loescher, Thomas; Bretzel, Gisela; Herbinger, Karl-Heinz] Univ Munich, Univ Hosp, Dept Infect Dis & Trop Med DITM, Munich, Germany; [Badziklou, Kossi; Halatoko, Wemboo Afiwa; Maman, Issaka; Bidjada, Bawimodom; Koba, Adjaho; Awoussi, Koffi Somenou; Kere, Abiba Banla] Minist Hlth, Natl Inst Hyg, Lome, Togo; [Frimpong, Michael] Kwame Nkrumah Univ Sci & Technol, Kumasi Ctr Collaborat Res Trop Med KCCR, Kumasi, Ghana; [Kabiru, Abass Mohammed] Agogo Presbyterian Hosp, Agogo, Ghana; [Piten, Ebekalisai] Ctr Hosp Reg Maritime, Tsevie, Togo; [Kobara, Basile] Minist Hlth, Programme Natl Lutte Contre Ulcere Buruli Lepre &, Lome, Togo; [Nitschke, Joerg; Wiedemann, Franz Xaver] Togo Off DAHWT, German Leprosy & TB Relief Assoc, Lome, Togo; [Fleischer, Bernhard] Bernhard Nocht Inst Trop Med, D-20359 Hamburg, Germany","Phillips, RO (reprint author), Kwame Nkrumah Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Med Sci, Dept Med, Kumasi, Ghana.",herbinger@lrz.uni-muenchen.de,,"Frimpong, Michael/0000-0003-1901-6793; Amoako, Yaw A/0000-0002-4642-789X; Phillips, Richard/0000-0001-8992-0222",EC [241500]; European Commission under the 7th Framework Programme of the European Union; Medical Research Council [MR/J01477X/1],"EC-funded research project ""BuruliVac"" (FP7/2010-2013; grant agreement No 241500).

This pathogen can survive for over a month in stored blood. However, its prevalence among blood donors is unknown, and screening of blood supplies for this pathogen is not routinely performed. We investigated Bartonella spp. prevalence in 500 blood donors from Campinas, Brazil, based on a cross-sectional design. Blood samples were inoculated into an enrichment liquid growth medium and sub-inoculated onto blood agar. Liquid culture samples and Gram-negative isolates were tested using a genus specific ITS PCR with amplicons sequenced for species identification. Bartonella henselae and Bartonella quintana antibodies were assayed by indirect immunofluorescence. B. henselae was isolated from six donors (1.2%). Sixteen donors (3.2%) were Bartonella-PCR positive after culture in liquid or on solid media, with 15 donors infected with B. henselae and one donor infected with Bartonella clarridgeiae. Antibodies against B. henselae or B. quintana were found in 16% and 32% of 500 blood donors, respectively. Serology was not associated with infection, with only three of 16 Bartonella-infected subjects seropositive for B. henselae or B. quintana. Bartonella DNA was present in the bloodstream of approximately one out of 30 donors from a major blood bank in South America. Negative serology does not rule out Bartonella spp. infection in healthy subjects. Using a combination of liquid and solid cultures, PCR, and DNA sequencing, this study documents for the first time that Bartonella spp. bacteremia occurs in asymptomatic blood donors. Our findings support further evaluation of Bartonella spp. transmission which can occur through blood transfusions.","[Urso Pitassi, Luiza Helena; Drummond, Marina Rovani; Lania, Bruno Grosselli; Neves Ferreira Velho, Paulo Eduardo] State Univ Campinas UNICAMP, Dept Med, Div Dermatol, Campinas, SP, Brazil; [Vissotto De Paiva Diniz, Pedro Paulo; Sowy, Stanley] Western Univ Hlth Sci, Coll Vet Med, Pomona, CA USA; [Scorpio, Diana Gerardi] Johns Hopkins Univ, Sch Med, Dept Mol & Comparat Pathobiol, Baltimore, MD USA; [Barjas-Castro, Maria Lourdes] State Univ Campinas UNICAMP, Dept Med, Ctr Hematol & Hemoterapia HEMOCTR, Campinas, SP, Brazil; [Gilioli, Rovilson] State Univ Campinas UNICAMP, Multidisciplinary Ctr Biol Invest CEMIB, Lab Anim Qual Control, Campinas, SP, Brazil; [Colombo, Silvia] Secretaria Estado Saude Sao Paulo, Dept Virol, Adolfo Lutz Inst IAL, Sao Paulo, Brazil; [Breitschwerdt, Edward B.] N Carolina State Univ, Coll Vet Med, Intracellular Pathogens Res Lab, Raleigh, NC USA; [Nicholson, William L.] Ctr Dis Control & Prevent, Rickettsial Zoonoses Branch, Atlanta, GA USA","Pitassi, LHU (reprint author), State Univ Campinas UNICAMP, Dept Med, Div Dermatol, Campinas, SP, Brazil.",diniz@westernu.edu,"Drummond, Marina R/M-3044-2018; Lania, Bruno/J-7496-2012","Drummond, Marina R/0000-0001-6849-608X; Lania, Bruno/0000-0003-4949-7444","Faculty Grant in Global Health from the Johns Hopkins Center for Global Health; FAEPEX-UNICAMP (Fundo de Apoio ao Ensino, a Pesquisa e a Extensao-UNICAMP) [234/10, 292/10]; Office of the Vice President for Research and Biotechnology, Western University, Western University of Health Sciences, Pomona, CA","This project was the basis for the PhD thesis of LHUP and was partially funded by the Faculty Grant in Global Health to DGS from the Johns Hopkins Center for Global Health; a grant from FAEPEX-UNICAMP (Fundo de Apoio ao Ensino, a Pesquisa e a Extensao-UNICAMP) under protocols number 234/10 and 292/10; and a summer research scholarship to SS from the Office of the Vice President for Research and Biotechnology, Western University, Western University of Health Sciences, Pomona, CA.

Molecular methods such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR) are highly sensitive but remain too laborious for field deployment. In this study, the applicability of a malaria diagnosis kit based on loop-mediated isothermal amplification (mLAMP) was assessed in malaria endemic areas of Colombia with Plasmodium vivax predominance. Methodology/Principal Findings: First, a passive case detection (PCD) study on 278 febrile patients recruited in Tierralta (department of Cordoba) was conducted to assess the diagnostic performance of the mLAMP method. Second, an active case detection (ACD) study on 980 volunteers was conducted in 10 sentinel sites with different epidemiological profiles. Whole blood samples were processed for microscopic and mLAMP diagnosis. Additionally RT-PCR and nested RT-PCR were used as reference tests. In the PCD study, P. falciparum accounted for 23.9% and P. vivax for 76.1% of the infections and no cases of mixed-infections were identified. Microscopy sensitivity for P. falciparum and P. vivax were 100% and 86.1%, respectively. mLAMP sensitivity for P. falciparum and P. vivax was 100% and 91.4%, respectively. In the ACD study, mLAMP detected 65 times more cases than microscopy. A high proportion (98.0%) of the infections detected by mLAMP was from volunteers without symptoms. Conclusions/Significance: mLAMP sensitivity and specificity were comparable to RT-PCR. LAMP was significantly superior to microscopy and in P. vivax low-endemicity settings and under minimum infrastructure conditions, it displayed sensitivity and specificity similar to that of single-well RT-PCR for detection of both P. falciparum and P. vivax infections. Here, the dramatically increased detection of asymptomatic malaria infections by mLAMP demonstrates the usefulness of this new tool for diagnosis, surveillance, and screening in elimination strategies.","[Vallejo, Andres F.; Martinez, Nora L.; Arevalo-Herrera, Myriam; Herrera, Socrates] Caucaseco Sci Res Ctr, Cali, Colombia; [Gonzalez, Iveth J.] Fdn Innovat New Diagnost, Geneva, Switzerland; [Arevalo-Herrera, Myriam] Univ Valle, Fac Hlth, Cali, Colombia","Vallejo, AF (reprint author), Caucaseco Sci Res Ctr, Cali, Colombia.",sherrera@inmuno.org,,"Vallejo, Andres Felipe/0000-0002-4688-0598","NIAID/ICEMR [U19AI089702]; Colciencias [360-2011, 719-2013]; Foundation for Innovative New Diagnostics (FIND); German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) through the KfW Entwicklungsbank","This work was supported by the NIAID/ICEMR (research grant U19AI089702), Colciencias (research grants 360-2011 and 719-2013), and the Foundation for Innovative New Diagnostics (FIND) with funds from the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) through the KfW Entwicklungsbank.

ICOSL plays an important role in controlling specific aspects of T cell activation, differentiation, and function. Previous work has suggested that ICOS is essential for Th17 cell development. However, the immunopathogenesis of this pathway in schistosomiasis fibrosisis still unclear. Methodology/Principal Findings Using models of schistosomiasis in ICOSL KO and the C57BL/6 WT mice, we studied the role of the ICOSL/ICOS interaction in the mediation of the Th17 response in host granulomatous inflammation, particularly in liver fibrosis during S. japonicum infection, and investigated the immune responses and pathology of ICOSL KO mice in these models. The results showed that ICOSL KO mice exhibited improved survival, reduced liver granulomatous inflammation around parasite eggs, markedly inhibited hepatic fibrosis development, lower levels of Th17-related cytokines (IL-17/IL-21), Th2-related cytokines (IL-4/IL-6/IL-10), a pro-fibrotic cytokine (IL-13), and TGF-beta 1, but higher level of Th1-related cytokine (IFN-gamma) compared to wild-type (WT) mice. The reduced progression of fibrogenesis was correlated with the down-regulation of Th17 and Th2 and the elimination of ICOSL/ICOS interactions. Conclusions/Significance Our findings suggest that IL-17-producing cells contribute to the hepatic granulomatous inflammation and subsequent fibrosis. Importantly, there was a clearly positive correlation between the presence of IL-17-producing cells and ICOS expression in ICOSL KO mice, and additional results indicated that Th17 was involved in the pathological tissue remodeling in liver fibrosis induced by schistosomiasis.","[Wang, Bo; Liang, Song; Wang, Yu; Gong, Wei; Zhang, Hui-Qin; Li, Ying; Xia, Chao-Ming] Soochow Univ, Coll Med, Dept Parasitol, Suzhou, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Zhu, Xing-Quan] Chinese Acad Agr Sci, Lanzhou Vet Res Inst, Key Lab Vet Parasitol Gansu Prov, State Key Lab Vet Etiol Biol, Lanzhou, Gansu, Peoples R China","Xia, CM (reprint author), Soochow Univ, Coll Med, Dept Parasitol, Suzhou, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",XCM624@hotmail.com,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China [81171603, 81471977]; Priority Academic Program Development of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutious; Jiangsu Province Postgraduate Research and Innovation Program [CXZZ12_0830]","This work was supported by grants from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No: 81171603 and No: 81471977), A Project Funded by the Priority Academic Program Development of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutious to Chao-Ming Xia and a grant from the Jiangsu Province Postgraduate Research and Innovation Program (NO: CXZZ12_0830) to BW.

Outbreaks of RVF are sporadic and associated with both seasonal and socioeconomic effects. Here we propose an almost periodic three-patch model to investigate the transmission dynamics of RVF virus (RVFV) among ruminants with spatial movements. Our findings indicate that, in Northeastern Africa, human activities, including those associated with the Eid al Adha feast, along with a combination of climatic factors such as rainfall level and hydrological variations, contribute to the transmission and dispersal of the disease pathogen. Moreover, sporadic outbreaks may occur when the two events occur together: 1) abundant livestock are recruited into areas at risk from RVF due to the demand for the religious festival and 2) abundant numbers of mosquitoes emerge. These two factors have been shown to have impacts on the severity of RVF outbreaks. Our numerical results present the transmission dynamics of the disease pathogen over both short and long periods of time, particularly during the festival time. Further, we investigate the impact on patterns of disease outbreaks in each patch brought by festival-and seasonal-driven factors, such as the number of livestock imported daily, the animal transportation speed from patch to patch, and the death rate induced by ceremonial sacrifices. In addition, our simulations show that when the time for festival preparation starts earlier than usual, the risk of massive disease outbreaks rises, particularly in patch 3 (the place where the religious ceremony will be held).","[Xiao, Yanyu; Cantrell, Robert Stephen; Cosner, Chris; Ruan, Shigui] Univ Miami, Dept Math, Coral Gables, FL 33124 USA; [Xiao, Yanyu; Beier, John C.] Univ Miami, Miller Sch Med, Dept Publ Hlth Sci, Coral Gables, FL 33124 USA; [DeAngelis, Donald L.] Univ Miami, US Geol Survey, Dept Biol, Coral Gables, FL 33124 USA","Xiao, YY (reprint author), Univ Miami, Dept Math, Coral Gables, FL 33124 USA.",ruan@math.miami.edu,,,National Institute of Health (NIH) [R01GM093345]; National Science Foundation (NSF) [DMS-1412454],"This work was supported by the National Institute of Health (NIH) grant R01GM093345.

Methodology/Principal Findings: A disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) approach was adopted to measure the burden of scrub typhus in Laiwu, China during the period 2006 to 2012. A multiple seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average model (SARIMA) was used to identify the most suitable forecasting model for scrub typhus in Laiwu. Results showed that the disease burden of scrub typhus is increasing yearly in Laiwu, and which is higher in females than males. For both females and males, DALY rates were highest for the 60-69 age group. Of all the SARIMA models tested, the SARIMA(2,1,0)(0,1,0)(12) model was the best fit for scrub typhus cases in Laiwu. Human infections occurred mainly in autumn with peaks in October. Conclusions/Significance: Females, especially those of 60 to 69 years of age, were at highest risk of developing scrub typhus in Laiwu, China.

Human landing collection is the standard employed for collection of the vectors for this parasite. Recent studies reported the development of traps that have the potential for replacing humans for surveillance of O. volvulus in the vector population. However, the key chemical components of human odor that are attractive to vector black flies have not been identified. Methodology/Principal Findings: Human sweat compounds were analyzed using GC-MS analysis and compounds common to three individuals identified. These common compounds, with others previously identified as attractive to other hematophagous arthropods were evaluated for their ability to stimulate and attract the major onchocerciasis vectors in Africa (Simulium damnosum sensu lato) and Latin America (Simulium ochraceum s. l.) using electroantennography and a Y tube binary choice assay. Medium chain length carboxylic acids and aldehydes were neurostimulatory for S. damnosum s. l. while S. ochraceum s. l. was stimulated by short chain aliphatic alcohols and aldehydes. Both species were attracted to ammonium bicarbonate and acetophenone. The compounds were shown to be attractive to the relevant vector species in field studies, when incorporated into a formulation that permitted a continuous release of the compound over time and used in concert with previously developed trap platforms. Conclusions/Significance: The identification of compounds attractive to the major vectors of O. volvulus will permit the development of optimized traps. Such traps may replace the use of human vector collectors for monitoring the effectiveness of onchocerciasis elimination programs and could find use as a contributing component in an integrated vector control/drug program aimed at eliminating river blindness in Africa.","[Young, Ryan M.; Baker, Bill] Univ S Florida, Ctr Drug Discovery & Innovat, Tampa, FL 33620 USA; [Burkett-Cadena, Nathan D.; McGaha, Tommy W., Jr.; Unnasch, Thomas R.] Univ S Florida, Global Hlth Infect Dis Res Program, Dept Global Hlth, Tampa, FL USA; [Rodriguez-Perez, Mario A.] Inst Politecn Nacl, Ctr Biotecnol Genom, Reynosa, Tamaulipas, Mexico; [Rodriguez-Perez, Mario A.; Salinas-Carmona, Mario C.] Univ Autonoma Nuevo Leon, Fac Med, Nuevo Leon, Mexico; [Toe, Laurent D.; Sanfo, Moussa] African Programme Onchocerciasis Control, Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso; [Adeleke, Monsuru A.] Osun State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Osogbo, Nigeria; [Soungalo, Traore] Minist Sante, Programme Natl Lutte Onchocercose, Direct Lute Contre Malad, Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso; [Katholi, Charles R.] Univ Alabama Birmingham, Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Biostat, Birmingham, AL 35294 USA; [Noblet, Raymond] Univ Georgia, Dept Entomol, Athens, GA 30602 USA; [Fadamiro, Henry; Cupp, Eddie W.] Auburn Univ, Dept Entomol & Plant Pathol, Auburn, AL 36849 USA; [Torres-Estrada, Jose L.] Inst Nacl Salud Publ, Ctr Reg Invest Salud Publ, Tapachula, Chiapas, Mexico","Young, RM (reprint author), Univ S Florida, Ctr Drug Discovery & Innovat, Tampa, FL 33620 USA.",tunnasch@health.usf.edu,"Baker, Bill/N-4312-2019","Burkett-Cadena, Nathan/0000-0001-6168-1637",Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation [OPP1017870],"This project was supported by a grant from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation (Project OPP1017870).

Although mostly asymptomatic at its initial stage, after the disease becomes chronic, about a third of the infected patients progress to a potentially fatal outcome due to severe damage of heart and gut tissues. There is an urgent need for new drugs against Chagas disease since there are only two drugs available, benznidazole and nifurtimox, and both show toxic side effects and variable efficacy against the chronic stage of the disease. Methodology/Principal Findings Genetically engineered parasitic strains are used for high throughput screening (HTS) of large chemical collections in the search for new anti-parasitic compounds. These assays, although successful, are limited to reporter transgenic parasites and do not cover the wide T. cruzi genetic background. With the aim to contribute to the early drug discovery process against Chagas disease we have developed an automated image-based 384-well plate HTS assay for T. cruzi amastigote replication in a rat myoblast host cell line. An image analysis script was designed to inform on three outputs: total number of host cells, ratio of T. cruzi amastigotes per cell and percentage of infected cells, which respectively provides one host cell toxicity and two T. cruzi toxicity readouts. The assay was statistically robust (Z values >0.6) and was validated against a series of known anti-trypanosomatid drugs. Conclusions/Significance We have established a highly reproducible, high content HTS assay for screening of chemical compounds against T. cruzi infection of myoblasts that is amenable for use with any T. cruzi strain capable of in vitro infection. Our visual assay informs on both anti-parasitic and host cell toxicity readouts in a single experiment, allowing the direct identification of compounds selectively targeted to the parasite.","[Alonso-Padilla, Julio; Rodriguez, Ana] NYU, Sch Med, Dept Microbiol, Div Parasitol, New York, NY 10016 USA; [Cotillo, Ignacio; Cantizani, Juan] GlaxoSmithKline, Dis Developing World, Madrid, Spain; [Presa, Jesus L.; Pena, Imanol; Bardera, Ana I.; Martin, Jose J.] GlaxoSmithKline, Mol Discovery Res, Madrid, Spain","Alonso-Padilla, J (reprint author), NYU, Sch Med, Dept Microbiol, Div Parasitol, New York, NY 10016 USA.",ana.rodriguez@nyumc.org,,"Alonso Padilla, Julio/0000-0003-4466-7969; Rodriguez, Ana/0000-0002-0060-3405; STEPANOVA, ANNA/0000-0003-1018-4758",Tres Cantos Open Lab Foundation,"This work was funded by an award from the Tres Cantos Open Lab Foundation to AR.

Here we genotyped 613 MTBC clinical isolates from Ghana, and searched for associations between the different phylogenetic lineages of MTBC and patient variables. We found that 17.1% (105/613) of the MTBC isolates belonged to M. africanum, with the remaining belonging to M. tuberculosis sensu stricto. No M. bovis was identified in this sample. M. africanum was significantly more common in tuberculosis patients belonging to the Ewe ethnic group (adjusted odds ratio: 3.02; 95% confidence interval: 1.67-5.47, p<0.001). Stratifying our analysis by the two phylogenetic lineages of M. africanum (i.e. MTBC Lineages 5 and 6) revealed that this association was mainly driven by Lineage 5 (also known as M. africanum West Africa 1). Our findings suggest interactions between the genetic diversity of MTBC and human diversity, and offer a possible explanation for the geographical restriction of M. africanum to parts of West Africa.","[Asante-Poku, Adwoa; Yeboah-Manu, Dorothy; Otchere, Isaac Darko; Aboagye, Samuel Y.; Danso, Emelia] Univ Ghana, Noguchi Mem Inst Med Res, Dept Bacteriol, Legon, Ghana; [Asante-Poku, Adwoa; Stucki, David; Borrell, Sonia; Feldmann, Julia; Gagneux, Sebastien] Swiss Trop & Publ Hlth Inst, Dept Med Parasitol & Infect Biol, Basel, Switzerland; [Asante-Poku, Adwoa; Stucki, David; Hattendorf, Jan; Borrell, Sonia; Feldmann, Julia; Gagneux, Sebastien] Univ Basel, Basel, Switzerland; [Hattendorf, Jan] Swiss Trop & Publ Hlth Inst, Dept Epidemiol & Publ Hlth, Basel, Switzerland","Asante-Poku, A (reprint author), Univ Ghana, Noguchi Mem Inst Med Res, Dept Bacteriol, Legon, Ghana.",sebastien.gagneux@unibas.ch,"Hattendorf, Jan/F-5371-2010","Hattendorf, Jan/0000-0002-1176-401X; Otchere, Isaac Darko/0000-0001-8982-9488; Aboagye, Sammy/0000-0001-7702-982X; Stucki, David/0000-0003-0131-9980","Leverhulme-Royal Society Africa Award [AA080019]; National Tuberculosis Program Ghana; Swiss National Science Foundation [PP00P3_150750]; ""Amt fur Ausbildungsbeitrage"", Canton of Basel, Switzerland; government of Ghana","This study was supported by the Leverhulme-Royal Society Africa Award (grant AA080019 to DYM and SG), the National Tuberculosis Program Ghana, and the Swiss National Science Foundation (PP00P3_150750).

Straw-colored fruit bats (Eidolon helvum) are commonly infected with several bartonella strains. To elucidate the genetic diversity of these bartonella strains, we analyzed 79 bartonella isolates from straw-colored fruit bats in seven countries across Africa (Cameroon, Annobon island of Equatorial Guinea, Ghana, Kenya, Nigeria, Tanzania, and Uganda) using a multi-locus sequencing typing (MLST) approach based on nucleotide sequences of eight loci (ftsZ, gltA, nuoG, ribC, rpoB, ssrA, ITS, and 16S rRNA). The analysis of each locus but ribC demonstrated clustering of the isolates into six genogroups (E1 - E5 and Ew), while ribC was absent in the isolates belonging to the genogroup Ew. In general, grouping of all isolates by each locus was mutually supportive; however, nuoG, gltA, and rpoB showed some incongruity with other loci in several strains, suggesting a possibility of recombination events, which were confirmed by network analyses and recombination/mutation rate ratio (r/m) estimations. The MLST scheme revealed 45 unique sequence types (ST1 - 45) among the analyzed bartonella isolates. Phylogenetic analysis of concatenated sequences supported the discrimination of six phylogenetic lineages (E1 - E5 and Ew) corresponding to separate and unique Bartonella species. One of the defined lineages, Ew, consisted of only two STs (ST1 and ST2), and comprised more than one-quarter of the analyzed isolates, while other lineages contained higher numbers of STs with a smaller number of isolates belonging to each lineage. The low number of allelic polymorphisms of isolates belonging to Ew suggests a more recent origin for this species. Our findings suggest that at least six Bartonella species are associated with straw-colored fruit bats, and that distinct STs can be found across the distribution of this bat species, including in populations of bats which are genetically distinct.","[Bai, Ying; Mckee, Clifton D.; Kosoy, Michael Y.] Ctr Dis Control & Prevent, Div Vector Borne Dis, Ft Collins, CO 80521 USA; [Hayman, David T.

In an effort to better understand the molecular causes and consequences of these differences, we sequenced the genome of an akinetoplastic T. evansi strain from China and compared it to the T. b. brucei reference strain. The annotated T. evansi genome shows extensive similarity to the reference, with 94.9% of the predicted T. b. brucei coding sequences (CDS) having an ortholog in T. evansi, and 94.6% of the non-repetitive orthologs having a nucleotide identity of 95% or greater. Interestingly, several procyclin-associated genes (PAGs) were disrupted or not found in this T. evansi strain, suggesting a selective loss of function in the absence of the insect life-cycle stage. Surprisingly, orthologous sequences were found in T. evansi for all 978 nuclear CDS predicted to represent the mitochondrial proteome in T. brucei, although a small number of these may have lost functionality. Consistent with previous results, the F1FO-ATP synthase gamma subunit was found to have an A281 deletion, which is involved in generation of a mitochondrial membrane potential in the absence of kDNA. Candidates for CDS that are absent from the reference genome were identified in supplementary de novo assemblies of T. evansi reads. Phylogenetic analyses show that the sequenced strain belongs to a dominant group of clonal T. evansi strains with worldwide distribution that also includes isolates classified as T. equiperdum. At least three other types of T. evansi or T. equiperdum have emerged independently. Overall, the elucidation of the T. evansi genome sequence reveals extensive similarity of T. brucei and supports the contention that T. evansi should be classified as a subspecies of T. brucei.","[Carnes, Jason; Anupama, Atashi; Brown, Rob; Cestari, Igor; Gendrin, Claire; McDermott, Suzanne M.; Merritt, Chris; Monnerat, Severine; Moon, Wonjong; Myler, Peter; Phan, Isabelle; Ramasamy, Gowthaman; Sivam, Dhileep] Seattle Biomed Res Inst, Seattle, WA 98109 USA; [Balmer, Oliver] Swiss Trop & Publ Hlth Inst, Basel, Switzerland; [Jackson, Andrew] Univ Liverpool, Inst Infect & Global Hlth, Dept Infect Biol, Liverpool L69 3BX, Merseyside, England; [Lewis, Michael] London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, Fac Infect & Trop Dis, Dept Pathogen Mol Biol, London WC1, England; [Desquesnes, Marc] CIRAD, UMR InterTryp, Montpellier, France; [Desquesnes, Marc] Kasetsart Univ, Fac Vet Med, Bangkok, Thailand; [Hertz-Fowler, Christiane] Univ Liverpool, Ctr Genom Res, Inst Integrat Biol, Liverpool L69 3BX, Merseyside, England; [Imamura, Hideo] Inst Trop Med, Dept Biomed Sci, Unit Mol Parasitol, B-2000 Antwerp, Belgium; [Ivens, Alasdair; Schnaufer, Achim] Univ Edinburgh, Ctr Immun Infect & Evolut, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland; [Koreny, Ludek; Lai, De-Hua; Lukes, Julius] Czech Acad Sci, Ctr Biol, Inst Parasitol, Ceske Budejovice, Czech Republic; [Koreny, Ludek; Lai, De-Hua; Lukes, Julius] Univ South Bohemia, Fac Sci, Ceske Budejovice, Czech Republic; [Lai, De-Hua; Lun, Zhao-Rong] Sun Yat Sen Univ, Sch Life Sci, Ctr Parasit Organisms, State Key Lab Biocontrol, Guangzhou 510275, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Lai, De-Hua; Lun, Zhao-Rong] Sun Yat Sen Univ, Zhongshan Sch Med, Key Lab Trop Dis Control, Minist Educ, Guangzhou 510275, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [MacLeod, Annette] Univ Glasgow, Coll Med Vet & Life Sci, Wellcome Trust Ctr Mol Parasitol, Inst Biodivers Anim Hlth & Comparat Med, Glasgow, Lanark, Scotland; [Lukes, Julius] Canadian Inst Adv Res, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Stuart, Ken] Univ Washington, Dept Global Hlth, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Schnaufer, Achim] Univ Edinburgh, Inst Immunol & Infect Res, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland","Carnes, J (reprint author), Univ Dundee, Coll Life Sci, Dundee, Scotland.",lsslzr@mail.sysu.edu.cn; jula@paru.cas.cz; ken.stuart@seattlebiomed.org; achim.schnaufer@ed.ac.uk,"Koreny, Ludek/G-9766-2014; Lai, De-Hua/G-8943-2015; McDermott, Suzanne/P-6392-2019; Lukes, Julius/H-6760-2012","Lai, De-Hua/0000-0002-4709-1507; McDermott, Suzanne/0000-0003-2158-1695; Lukes, Julius/0000-0002-0578-6618; Imamura, Hideo/0000-0002-3282-1319; Carnes, Jason/0000-0001-7302-1935; Balmer, Oliver/0000-0001-7572-7747; Desquesnes, Marc/0000-0002-7665-2422; Ivens, Al/0000-0002-0112-3876; Hertz-Fowler, Christiane/0000-0002-0729-6479; Lewis, Michael/0000-0001-9540-3280; Schnaufer, Achim/0000-0003-2132-5560; Jackson, Andrew Paul/0000-0002-5704-8596; Brown, Robert/0000-0003-4086-7699","US National Institutes of Health [AI014102, AI69057]; UK Medical Research Council [G0600129]; EU [316304]; Bioglobe grant [CZ.1.07/2.3.00/30.0032]; Praemium Academiae award; National Science Foundation of China [30670275, 31272305]; Medical Research Council [G0600129]","This work was supported by US National Institutes of Health (www.nih.gov) grants AI014102 (to KS) and AI69057 (to AS), UK Medical Research Council (www.mrc.ac.uk) grant G0600129 (to AS), EU grant (ec.europa.eu) FP7/2007-2013 (no. 316304), Bioglobe grant CZ.1.07/2.3.00/30.0032, and the Praemium Academiae award (to JL, who is a Fellow of the Canadian Institute for Advanced Research), and National Science Foundation of China (www.nsfc.gov.cn) grants #30670275 and #31272305 (to ZRL).

The control of this vector-borne disease focuses on halting transmission by reducing or eliminating insect vector populations. Most transmission of Trypanosoma cruzi, the causative agent of Chagas disease, involves insects living within or very close to households and feeding mostly on domestic animals. As animal hosts can be intermittently present it is important to understand how host availability can modify transmission risk to humans and to characterize the host-seeking dispersal of triatomine vectors on a very fine scale. We used a semi-field system with motion-detection cameras to characterize the dispersal of Triatoma infestans, and compare the behavior of vector populations in the constant presence of hosts (guinea pigs), and after the removal of the hosts. The emigration rate - net insect population decline in original refuge - following host removal was on average 19.7% of insects per 10 days compared to 10.2% in constant host populations (p = 0.029). However, dispersal of T. infestans occurred in both directions, towards and away from the initial location of the hosts. The majority of insects that moved towards the original location of guinea pigs remained there for 4 weeks. Oviposition and mortality were observed and analyzed in the context of insect dispersal, but only mortality was higher in the group where animal hosts were removed (p-value <0.01). We discuss different survival strategies associated with the observed behavior and its implications for vector control. Removing domestic animals in infested areas increases vector dispersal from the first day of host removal. The implications of these patterns of vector dispersal in a field setting are not yet known but could result in movement towards human rooms.","[Castillo-Neyra, Ricardo] Johns Hopkins Bloomberg Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Epidemiol, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA; [Castillo-Neyra, Ricardo; Barbu, Corentin M.; Levy, Michael Z.] Univ Penn, Perelman Sch Med, Dept Biostatist & Epidemiol, Ctr Clin Epidemiol & Biostatist, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Salazar, Renzo; Borrini, Katty; Naquira, Cesar] Univ Peruana Cayetano Heredia, Sch Sci & Philosophy, Lima, Peru","Castillo-Neyra, R (reprint author), Johns Hopkins Bloomberg Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Epidemiol, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA.",rcastillo@jhu.edu,,"Salazar Sanchez, Renzo Sadath/0000-0002-5127-0479; Naquira, Cesar/0000-0003-0271-4165; Borrini Mayori, Katty/0000-0003-3134-7069",Center for a Livable Future; Fogarty National Institutes of Health [1D43TW008273],"During this study RCN was supported by a fellowship from the Center for a Livable Future and a Fogarty National Institutes of Health training grant 1D43TW008273.

Although the country-wide prevalence of schistosomiasis japonica in the Philippines is relatively low, the prevalence of schistosomiasis can be high, approaching 65% in some endemic areas. Of the currently available microscopy-based diagnostic techniques for detecting schistosome infections in the Philippines and elsewhere, most exhibit varying diagnostic performances, with the Kato-Katz (KK) method having particularly poor sensitivity for detecting low intensity infections. This suggests that the actual prevalence of schistosomiasis japonica may be much higher than previous reports have indicated. Methodology/Principal Findings Six barangay (villages) were selected to determine the prevalence of S. japonicum in humans in the municipality of Palapag, Northern Samar. Fecal samples were collected from 560 humans and examined by the KK method and a validated real-time PCR (qPCR) assay. A high S. japonicum prevalence (90.2%) was revealed using qPCR whereas the KK method indicated a lower prevalence (22.9%). The geometric mean eggs per gram (GMEPG) determined by the qPCR was 36.5 and 11.5 by the KK. These results, particularly those obtained by the qPCR, indicate that the prevalence of schistosomiasis in this region of the Philippines is much higher than historically reported. Conclusions/Significance Despite being more expensive, qPCR can complement the KK procedure, particularly for surveillance and monitoring of areas where extensive schistosomiasis control has led to low prevalence and intensity infections and where schistosomiasis elimination is on the horizon, as for example in southern China.","[Gordon, Catherine.

Earlier we reported in vitro apoptotic antileishmanial activity of n-hexane fractions of Artemisia annua leaves (AAL) and seeds (AAS) against Leishmania donovani. In the present study, we investigated the immunostimulatory and therapeutic efficacy of AAL and AAS. Methodology/Principal Findings: Ten-weeks post infection, BALB/c mice were orally administered AAL and AAS for ten consecutive days. Significant reduction in hepatic (86.67% and 89.12%) and splenic (95.45% and 95.84%) parasite burden with decrease in spleen weight was observed. AAL and AAS treated mice induced the strongest DTH response, as well as three-fold decrease in IgG1 and two-fold increase in IgG2a levels, as compared to infected controls. Cytometric bead array further affirmed the elicitation of Th1 immune response as indicated by increased levels of IFN-gamma, and low levels of Th2 cytokines (IL-4 and IL-10) in serum as well as in culture supernatant of lymphocytes from treated mice. Lymphoproliferative response, IFN-gamma producing CD4(+) and CD8(+) T lymphocytes and nitrite levels were significantly enhanced upon antigen recall in vitro. The co-expression of CD80 and CD86 on macrophages was significantly augmented. CD8(+) T cells exhibited CD62L(low) and CD44(hi) phenotype, signifying induction of immunological memory in AAL and AAS treated groups. Serum enzyme markers were in the normal range indicating inertness against nephro- and hepato-toxicity. Conclusions/Significance: Our results establish the two-prong antileishmanial efficacy of AAL and AAS for cure against L. donovani that is dependent on both the direct leishmanicidal action as well as switching-on of Th1-biased protective cell-mediated immunity with generation of memory. AAL and AAS could represent adjunct therapies for the treatment of leishmaniasis, either alone or in combination with other antileishmanial agents.","[Islamuddin, Mohammad; Chouhan, Garima; Afrin, Farhat] Hamdard Univ, Jamia Hamdard, Dept Biotechnol, Parasite Immunol Lab, New Delhi, India; [Farooque, Abdullah; Dwarakanath, Bilikere S.] Inst Nucl Med & Allied Sci, Div Radiat Biosci, Delhi, India; [Sahal, Dinkar] Int Ctr Genet Engn & Biotechnol, Malaria Grp, New Delhi, India","Islamuddin, M (reprint author), Hamdard Univ, Jamia Hamdard, Dept Biotechnol, Parasite Immunol Lab, New Delhi, India.",farhatafrin@gmail.com,"Afrin, Farhat/F-2346-2018","Afrin, Farhat/0000-0003-4443-4284; Dwarakanath, Bilikere S./0000-0001-6988-2601","Department of Biotechnology, Government of India [BT/PR9715/PBD/17/534/2007, BT/PR10876/NNT/28/137/2008]; Indian Council of Medical Research [F/845/2011-ECD-II]; Department of Science and Technology, New Delhi, India [SR/FT/L-102/2006]; Central Council for Research in Unani Medicine, New Delhi, India [3-77/2005-CCRUM/Tech]","MI was previously the recipient of SRF from the Department of Biotechnology (BT/PR9715/PBD/17/534/2007), Government of India and is presently a recipient of SRF from the Indian Council of Medical Research (F/845/2011-ECD-II).

In addition, the effect of O. tsutsugamushi infection on metabolite concentrations over time was analyzed by two-way ANOVAs. Orthogonal partial least squares-discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) showed distinct metabolic patterns between control and O. tsutsugamushi-infected mice in liver, spleen, and serum samples. O. tsutsugamushi infection caused decreased energy production and deficiencies in both remethylation sources and glutathione. In addition, O. tsutsugamushi infection accelerated uncommon energy production pathways (i.e., excess fatty acid and protein oxidation) in host body. Infection resulted in an enlarged spleen with distinct phospholipid and amino acid characteristics. This study suggests that metabolite profiling of multiple organ tissues and serum could provide insight into global metabolic changes and mechanisms of pathology in O. tsutsugamushi-infected hosts.","[Jung, Jeeyoun; Jung, Youngae; Kim, Changhun; Hwang, Geum-Sook] Western Seoul Ctr, Korea Basic Sci Inst, Integrated Metabol Res Grp, Seoul, South Korea; [Jung, Jeeyoun] Korea Inst Oriental Med, KM Hlth Technol Res Grp Med Res Div, Taejon, South Korea; [Hwang, Kyu-Jam; Ju, Young-Ran; Chu, Hyuk] Korea Natl Inst Hlth, Div Zoonoses, Ctr Immunol & Pathol, Seoul, Chungcheongbuk, South Korea; [Lee, Hye-Ja] Korea Natl Inst Hlth, Div Metab Dis, Ctr Biomed Sci, Seoul, Chungcheongbuk, South Korea; [Hwang, Geum-Sook] Chungnam Natl Univ, Grad Sch Analyt Sci & Technol, Taejon, South Korea","Jung, J (reprint author), Western Seoul Ctr, Korea Basic Sci Inst, Integrated Metabol Res Grp, Seoul, South Korea.",chuhyuk@korea.kr; gshwang@kbsi.re.kr,,,"National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Ministry of Science, ICT & Future Planning, Korea [2010-0019394, 2013M3A9B6046418]; Korea Basic Science Institute [C34705]; Creative Allied Project (CAP); National Institute of Health [2010-N52001-00]","This study was supported by the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) funded by the Ministry of Science, ICT & Future Planning, Korea (2010-0019394 and 2013M3A9B6046418), Korea Basic Science Institute (C34705), the Creative Allied Project (CAP), and an intramural grant from the National Institute of Health (2010-N52001-00).

This study presents the disease-reduction outcomes of an integrated control program for schistosomiasis in Al Jabalain locality of White Nile State, Sudan from 2009 through 2011. Methods: The total population of the project sites was 482,902, and the major target group for intervention among them was 78,615 primary school students. For the cross-sectional study of the prevalence, urine and stool specimens were examined using the urine sedimentation method and the Kato cellophane thick smear method, respectively. To assess the impacts of health education for students and a drinking water supply facility at Al Hidaib village, questionnaire survey was done. Results: The overall prevalence for S. haematobium and S. mansoni at baseline was 28.5% and 0.4%, respectively. At follow-up survey after 6-9 months post-treatment, the prevalence of S. haematobium infection was reduced to 13.5% (95% CI = 0.331-0.462). A higher reduction in prevalence was observed among girls, those with moderately infected status (around 20%), and residents in rural areas, than among boys, those with high prevalence (>40%), and residents in urban areas. After health education, increased awareness about schistosomiasis was checked by questionnaire survey. Also, a drinking water facility was constructed at Al Hidaib village, where infection rate was reduced more compared to that in a neighboring village within the same unit. However, we found no significant change in the prevalence of S. mansoni infection between baseline and follow-up survey (95% CI = 0.933-6.891). Conclusions: At the end of the project, the prevalence of S. haematobium infection was reduced by more than 50% in comparison with the baseline rate. Approximately 200,000 subjects had received either praziquantel therapy, health education, or supply of clean water. To consolidate the achievements of this project, the integrated intervention should be adapted continuously.","[Lee, Young-Ha; Ismail, Hassan Ahmed Hassan Ahmed] Chungnam Natl Univ Sch Med, Dept Infect Biol, Taejon, South Korea; [Jeong, Hoo Gn; Kong, Woo Hyun; Lee, Soon-Hyung; Cho, Han-Ik] Korea Assoc Hlth Promot, Seoul, South Korea; [Nam, Hae-Sung] Chungnam Natl Univ Sch Med, Dept Prevent Med, Taejon, South Korea; [Oh, Chung Hyeon] Korea Int Cooperat Agcy, Songnam, South Korea; [Hong, Sung-Tae] Seoul Natl Univ Coll Med, Dept Trop Med & Parasitol, Seoul, South Korea","Lee, YH (reprint author), Chungnam Natl Univ Sch Med, Dept Infect Biol, Taejon, South Korea.",hst@snu.ac.kr,,"Nam, Hae-Sung/0000-0003-0911-4576",Korea International Coorperation Agency [2008-01-0000-039],"The Project for combating schistosomiasis in Al Jabalain locality in White Nile State, Sudan, has been attributed to the full support from Korea International Coorperation Agency (Project number 2008-01-0000-039, http://www.koica.go.kr/) as a Official Development Aid Program.

Heterogeneity in classical ETEC antigens known as colonization factors (CFs) and poor efficacy of toxoid-based approaches to date have impeded development of a broadly protective ETEC vaccine, prompting searches for novel molecular targets. Methodology Using a variety of molecular methods, we examined a large collection of ETEC isolates for production of two secreted plasmid-encoded pathotype-specific antigens, the EtpA extracellular adhesin, and EatA, a mucin-degrading serine protease; and two chromosomally-encoded molecules, the YghJ metalloprotease and the EaeH adhesin, that are not specific to the ETEC pathovar, but which have been implicated in ETEC pathogenesis. ELISA assays were also performed on control and convalescent sera to characterize the immune response to these antigens. Finally, mice were immunized with recombinant EtpA (rEtpA), and a protease deficient version of the secreted EatA passenger domain (rEatAp(H134R)) to examine the feasibility of combining these molecules in a subunit vaccine approach. Principal Findings EtpA and EatA were secreted by more than half of all ETEC, distributed over diverse phylogenetic lineages belonging to multiple CF groups, and exhibited surprisingly little sequence variation. Both chromosomally-encoded molecules were also identified in a wide variety of ETEC strains and YghJ was secreted by 89% of isolates. Antibodies against both the ETEC pathovar-specific and conserved E. coli antigens were present in significantly higher titers in convalescent samples from subjects with ETEC infection than controls suggesting that each of these antigens is produced and recognized during infection. Finally, co-immunization of mice with rEtpA and rEatAp(H134R) offered significant protection against ETEC infection. Conclusions Collectively, these data suggest that novel antigens could significantly complement current approaches and foster improved strategies for development of broadly protective ETEC vaccines.","[Luo, Qingwei; Fleckenstein, James M.] Washington Univ, Sch Med, Dept Med, Div Infect Dis, St Louis, MO 63110 USA; [Qadri, Firdausi] Int Ctr Diarrhoeal Dis Res, Dhaka 1000, Bangladesh; [Kansal, Rita] Univ Tennessee, Dept Microbiol Immunol & Biochem, Hlth Sci Ctr, Memphis, TN 38163 USA; [Rasko, David A.] Univ Maryland, Sch Med, Dept Microbiol & Immunol, Inst Genome Sci, Baltimore, MD 21201 USA; [Sheikh, Alaullah; Fleckenstein, James M.] Washington Univ, Sch Med, Div Biol & Biomed Sci, Mol Microbiol & Microbial Pathogenesis Program, St Louis, MO USA; [Fleckenstein, James M.] Vet Affairs Med Ctr, Med Serv, St Louis, MO USA","Luo, QW (reprint author), Washington Univ, Sch Med, Dept Med, Div Infect Dis, St Louis, MO 63110 USA.",jflecken@wustl.edu,"Fleckenstein, James M./P-6242-2019; Sheikh, Alaullah/H-3125-2019","Fleckenstein, James M./0000-0002-1148-697X; Sheikh, Alaullah/0000-0002-2972-6978; David, Rasko/0000-0002-7337-7154","National Institutes of Health/National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases [R01AI89894, HHSN272200900009C]; Department of Veterans Affairs, Office of Research and Development; Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation [OPP1099494]","These studies were funded in part by grant R01AI89894, and contract HHSN272200900009C from the National Institutes of Health/National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (http://www.niaid.nih.gov); the Department of Veterans Affairs, Office of Research and Development (http://www.research.va.gov); and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation (OPP1099494).

Because praziquantel is the only drug in therapeutic use, the risk of drug resistance is a concern. In the search for new schistosomicidal drugs, we performed a target-based chemogenomics screen of a dataset of 2,114 proteins to identify drugs that are approved for clinical use in humans that may be active against multiple life stages of Schistosoma mansoni. Each of these proteins was treated as a potential drug target, and its amino acid sequence was used to interrogate three databases: Therapeutic Target Database (TTD), DrugBank and STITCH. Predicted drug-target interactions were refined using a combination of approaches, including pairwise alignment, conservation state of functional regions and chemical space analysis. To validate our strategy, several drugs previously shown to be active against Schistosoma species were correctly predicted, such as clonazepam, auranofin, nifedipine, and artesunate. We were also able to identify 115 drugs that have not yet been experimentally tested against schistosomes and that require further assessment. Some examples are aprindine, gentamicin, clotrimazole, tetrabenazine, griseofulvin, and cinnarizine. In conclusion, we have developed a systematic and focused computer-aided approach to propose approved drugs that may warrant testing and/or serve as lead compounds for the design of new drugs against schistosomes.","[Neves, Bruno J.; Braga, Rodolpho C.; Andrade, Carolina H.] Univ Fed Goias, Fac Farm, LabMol Lab Drug Design & Modeling, Goiania, Go, Brazil; [Neves, Bruno J.; Bezerra, Jose C.

As such, these animals have evolved their own repertoire of complement-inactivating factors, which are inadvertently exploited by blood-borne pathogens to escape complement lysis. Unlike the bloodstream stages, the procyclic (insect) stage of Trypanosoma brucei is highly susceptible to complement killing, which is puzzling considering that a tsetse takes a bloodmeal every 2-4 days. In this study, we identified four tsetse (Glossina morsitans morsitans) serine protease inhibitors (serpins) from a midgut expressed sequence tag (EST) library (GmmSRPN3, GmmSRPN5, GmmSRPN9 and GmmSRPN10) and investigated their role in modulating the establishment of a T. brucei infection in the midgut. Although not having evolved in a common blood-feeding ancestor, all four serpins have an active site sharing remarkable homology with the human complement C1-inhibitor serpin, SerpinG1. RNAi knockdown of individual GmmSRPN9 and GmmSRPN10 genes resulted in a significant decreased rate of infection by procyclic form T. brucei. Furthermore, recombinant GmmSRPN10 was both able to inhibit the activity of human complement-cascade serine proteases, C1s and Factor D, and to protect the in vitro killing of procyclic trypanosomes when incubated with complement-activated human serum. Thus, the secretion of serpins, which may be part of a bloodmeal complement inactivation system in tsetse, is used by procyclic trypanosomes to evade an influx of fresh trypanolytic complement with each bloodmeal. This highlights another facet of the complicated relationship between T. brucei and its tsetse vector, where the parasite takes advantage of tsetse physiology to further its chances of propagation and transmission.","[Ooi, Cher-Pheng] Imperial College South Kensington, Dept Life Sci, London, England; [Ooi, Cher-Pheng; Haines, Lee R.; Southern, Daniel M.; Lehane, Michael J.; Acosta-Serrano, Alvaro] Univ Liverpool, Liverpool Sch Trop Med, Dept Vector Biol, Liverpool L3 5QA, Merseyside, England; [Southern, Daniel M.; Acosta-Serrano, Alvaro] Univ Liverpool, Liverpool Sch Trop Med, Dept Parasitol, Liverpool L3 5QA, Merseyside, England","Ooi, CP (reprint author), Imperial College South Kensington, Dept Life Sci, Sir Alexander Fleming Bldg, London, England.",cooi@imperial.ac.uk,"Haines, Lee/K-9264-2017; Ooi, Cher-Pheng/Q-9635-2018; Acosta-Serrano, Alvaro/L-5503-2015","Haines, Lee/0000-0001-8821-6479; Ooi, Cher-Pheng/0000-0002-1503-1155; Acosta-Serrano, Alvaro/0000-0002-2576-7959","Wellcome Trust [WT084143/Z/07/Z, WT093691/Z/10/Z]; Overseas Research Student Award Scheme (ORSAS) grant","This work has been supported by grants from the Wellcome Trust (WT084143/Z/07/Z to MJL and WT093691/Z/10/Z to AAS) while CPO was sponsored by an Overseas Research Student Award Scheme (ORSAS) grant.

A novel genotype of Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Typhimurium (multi-locus sequence type [ST] 313) circulating in this geographic region is genetically different to from S. Typhimurium ST19 strains that are common throughout the rest of the world. S. Typhimurium ST313 strains have acquired pseudogenes and genetic deletions and appear to be evolving to become more like the typhoidal serovars S. Typhi and S. Paratyphi A. Epidemiological and clinical data show that S. Typhimurium ST313 strains are clinically associated with invasive systemic disease (bacteremia, septicemia, meningitis) rather than with gastroenteritis. The current work summarizes investigations of the broad hypothesis that S. Typhimurium ST313 isolates from Mali, West Africa, will behave differently from ST19 isolates in various in vitro assays. Here, we show that strains of the ST313 genotype are phagocytosed more efficiently and are highly resistant to killing by macrophage cell lines and primary mouse and human macrophages compared to ST19 strains. S. Typhimurium ST313 strains survived and replicated within different macrophages. Infection of macrophages with S. Typhimurium ST19 strains resulted in increased apoptosis and higher production of proinflammatory cytokines, as measured by gene expression and protein production, compared to S. Typhimurium ST313 strains. This difference in proinflammatory cytokine production and cell death between S. Typhimurium ST19 and ST313 strains could be explained, in part, by an increased production of flagellin by ST19 strains. These observations provide further evidence that S. Typhimurium ST313 strains are phenotypically different to ST19 strains and instead share similar pathogenic characteristics with typhoidal Salmonella serovars.","[Ramachandran, Girish; Schmidlein, Patrick J.; Tennant, Sharon M.] Univ Maryland, Sch Med, Ctr Vaccine Dev, Baltimore, MD 21201 USA; [Ramachandran, Girish; Schmidlein, Patrick J.; Tennant, Sharon M.] Univ Maryland, Sch Med, Dept Med, Baltimore, MD 21201 USA; [Perkins, Darren J.] Univ Maryland, Sch Med, Dept Microbiol & Immunol, Baltimore, MD 21201 USA; [Tulapurkar, Mohan E.] Univ Maryland, Sch Med, Div Pulm & Crit Care, Baltimore, MD 21201 USA","Ramachandran, G (reprint author), Univ Maryland, Sch Med, Ctr Vaccine Dev, Baltimore, MD 21201 USA.",gramacha@medicine.umaryland.edu,"tulapurkar, mohan/F-1926-2015","tulapurkar, mohan/0000-0002-2476-5417",Middle Atlantic RCE Program NIAID/NIH [2 U54 AI057168],"Funding for this study was from a Career Development Award (SMT) funded by the Middle Atlantic RCE Program NIAID/NIH 2 U54 AI057168 grant (Myron M.

Although G. duodenalis can be cultured axenically, significant gaps exist in our understanding of the molecular biology and metabolism of this pathogen. The present study employed RNA sequencing to characterize the mRNA transcriptome of G. duodenalis trophozoites in axenic culture, at log (48 h of growth), stationary (60 h), and declining (96 h) growth phases. Using similar to 400-times coverage of the transcriptome, we identified 754 differentially transcribed genes (DTGs), mainly representing two large DTG groups: 438 that were down-regulated in the declining phase relative to log and stationary phases, and 281 that were up-regulated. Differential transcription of prominent antioxidant and glycolytic enzymes implicated oxygen tension as a key factor influencing the transcriptional program of axenic trophozoites. Systematic bioinformatic characterization of numerous DTGs encoding hypothetical proteins of unknown function was achieved using structural homology searching. This powerful approach greatly informed the differential transcription analysis and revealed putative novel antioxidant-coding genes, and the presence of a nearcomplete two-component-like signaling system that may link cytosolic redox or metabolite sensing to the observed transcriptional changes. Motif searching applied to promoter regions of the two large DTG groups identified different putative transcription factor-binding motifs that may underpin global transcriptional regulation. This study provides new insights into the drivers and potential mediators of transcriptional variation in axenic G. duodenalis and provides context for static transcriptional studies.","[Ansell, Brendan R.

With descriptions of the microbiota in humans, a new frontier of investigation is developing to decipher the complexity of host-parasite-microbiota relationships, instead of the classic reductionist approach, which considers host-parasite in isolation. Here, we review with specific examples the potential roles that the resident microbiota can play at mucosal interfaces in the transmission of parasitic protozoans and in the progress of infection and disease. Although the mechanisms underlying these relationships remain poorly understood, some examples provide compelling evidence that specific components of the microbiota can potentially alter the outcomes of parasitic infections and diseases in humans. Most findings suggest a protective role of the microbiota, which might lead to exploratory research comprising microbiota-based interventions to prevent and treat protozoal infections in the future. However, these infections are often accompanied by an unbalanced microbiota and, in some specific cases, apparently, these bacteria may contribute synergistically to disease progression. Taken together, these findings provide a different perspective on the ecological nature of protozoal infections. This review focuses attention on the importance of considering polymicrobial associations, i. e., parasitic protozoans and the host microbiota, for understanding these human infections in their natural microbial context.","[Baer, Ann-Katrein; Phukan, Niha; Pinheiro, Jully; Simoes-Barbosa, Augusto] Univ Auckland, Sch Biol Sci, Auckland 1, New Zealand; [Simoes-Barbosa, Augusto] Univ Auckland, Ctr Microbial Innovat, Auckland 1, New Zealand","Simoes-Barbosa, A (reprint author), Univ Auckland, Sch Biol Sci, Auckland 1, New Zealand.",a.barbosa@auckland.ac.nz,,"Bar, Ann-Katrein/0000-0001-8780-8552","Health Research Council of New Zealand [HRC 11/314]; Faculty Research Development Fund at University of Auckland, New Zealand","The preparation of this review was funded by The Health Research Council of New Zealand (HRC 11/314) and Faculty Research Development Fund at University of Auckland, New Zealand.

Praziquantel (PZQ), the only drug currently available for treatment and control, is largely ineffective against juvenile worms, and reports of PZQ resistance lend added urgency to the need for development of new therapeutics. Ion channels, which underlie electrical excitability in cells, are validated targets for many current anthelmintics. Transient receptor potential (TRP) channels are a large family of non-selective cation channels. TRP channels play key roles in sensory transduction and other critical functions, yet the properties of these channels have remained essentially unexplored in parasitic helminths. TRP channels fall into several (7-8) subfamilies, including TRPA and TRPV. Though schistosomes contain genes predicted to encode representatives of most of the TRP channel subfamilies, they do not appear to have genes for any TRPV channels. Nonetheless, we find that the TRPV1-selective activators capsaicin and resiniferatoxin (RTX) induce dramatic hyperactivity in adult worms; capsaicin also increases motility in schistosomula. SB 366719, a highly-selective TRPV1 antagonist, blocks the capsaicin-induced hyperactivity in adults. Mammalian TRPA1 is not activated by capsaicin, yet knockdown of the single predicted TRPA1-like gene (SmTRPA) in S. mansoni effectively abolishes capsaicin-induced responses in adult worms, suggesting that SmTRPA is required for capsaicin sensitivity in these parasites. Based on these results, we hypothesize that some schistosome TRP channels have novel pharmacological sensitivities that can be targeted to disrupt normal parasite neuromuscular function. These results also have implications for understanding the phylogeny of metazoan TRP channels and may help identify novel targets for new or repurposed therapeutics.","[Bais, Swarna; Greenberg, Robert M.] Univ Penn, Sch Vet Med, Dept Pathobiol, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Churgin, Matthew A.; Fang-Yen, Christopher] Univ Penn, Sch Engn & Appl Sci, Dept Bioengn, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA","Bais, S (reprint author), Univ Penn, Sch Vet Med, Dept Pathobiol, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.",rgree@vet.upenn.edu,,,"National Institutes of Health [R21AI100505, R01NS084835]; Sloan Research Fellowship from the Alfred P.

The mosquito Aedes bromeliae is a major vector of yellow fever, but it cannot be readily differentiated from its non-vector zoophilic sister species Ae. lilii using morphological characters. Genetic differences have been reported between anthropophilic Ae. bromeliae and zoophilic Ae. lilii and between forest and domestic populations. However, due to the application of different molecular markers and non-overlapping populations employed in previous studies, interpretation of species delimitation is unclear. Methodology/Principle Findings DNA sequences were generated from specimens of Ae. simpsoni s. l. from the Republic of Benin, Tanzania and Uganda for two nuclear genes apolipophorin 2 (apoLp2) and cytochrome p450 (CYPJ92), the ribosomal internal transcribed spacer region (ITS) and the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase (COI) barcoding region. Nuclear genes apoLp2 and CYPJ92 were unable to differentiate between species Ae. bromeliae and Ae. lilii due to ancestral lineage sorting, while ITS sequence data provided clear topological separation on a phylogeny. The standard COI barcoding region was shown to be subject to species introgression and unable to clearly distinguish the two taxa. Here we present a reliable direct PCR-based method for differentiation of the vector species Ae. bromeliae from its isomorphic, sympatric and non-biomedically important sister taxon, Ae. lilii, based on the ITS region. Using molecular species verification, we describe novel immature habitats for Ae. lilii and report both sympatric and allopatric populations. Whereas only Ae. lilii is found in the Republic of Benin and only Ae. bromeliae in Tanzania, both species are sympatric in Uganda. Conclusions/Significance Our accurate identification method will allow informed distribution and detailed ecological studies that will facilitate assessment of arboviral disease risk and development of future targeted vector control.","[Bennett, Kelly Louise; Shija, Fortunate; Walton, Catherine] Univ Manchester, Computat Evolutionary Biol Grp, Fac Life Sci, Manchester, Lancs, England; [Linton, Yvonne-Marie; Huang, Yiau-Min; Mitchell, Luke B.] Smithsonian Inst Museum Support Ctr, Walter Reed Biosystemat Unit, Suitland, MD USA; [Linton, Yvonne-Marie] Walter Reed Army Inst Res, Silver Spring, MD USA; [Linton, Yvonne-Marie] Uniformed Serv Univ Hlth Sci, Bethesda, MD 20814 USA; [Linton, Yvonne-Marie; Huang, Yiau-Min; Mitchell, Luke B.] Natl Museum Nat Hist, Dept Entomol, Smithsonian Inst, Washington, DC 20560 USA; [Shija, Fortunate; Misinzo, Gerald; Richards, Miriam] Sokoine Univ Agr, Dept Vet Microbiol & Parasitol, Morogoro, Tanzania; [Kaddumukasa, Martha; Lutwama, Julius] Uganda Virus Res Inst, Dept Arbovirol Emerging & Re Eemerging Infect, Entebbe, Uganda; [Djouaka, Rousseau; Tossou, Eric] Agroecohlth Platform West & Cent Africa, Int Inst Trop Agr, Porto Novo, Benin","Bennett, KL (reprint author), Univ Manchester, Computat Evolutionary Biol Grp, Fac Life Sci, Manchester, Lancs, England.",Catherine.walton@manchester.ac.uk,,"Walton, Catherine/0000-0001-8801-7103; Bennett, Kelly/0000-0003-0330-5275; Misinzo, Gerald/0000-0003-1827-6403","Royal Society; Leverhulme Trust [(AA110092]; Natural Environment Research Council [NE/H525170/1, NE/1528134/1, NE/J500057/1]; National Research Council (NRC); Natural Environment Research Council [1097371]","This work was supported by an Africa Award from the Royal Society and Leverhulme Trust (AA110092) and a PhD studentship to KLB funded by the Natural Environment Research Council [NE/H525170/1, NE/1528134/1, NE/J500057/1].

Inflammation around cysticerci is the major cause of disease but is variably present. One factor modulating the inflammatory responses may be the location and characteristics of the brain tissue adjacent to cysticerci. We analyzed and compared the inflammatory responses to cysticerci located in the parenchyma to those in the meninges or cysticerci partially in contact with both the parenchyma and the meninges (corticomeningeal). Methodology/Principal Findings Histological specimens of brain cysticerci (n = 196) from 11 pigs naturally infected with Taenia solium cysticerci were used. Four pigs were sacrificed after 2 days and four after 5 days of a single dose of praziquantel; 3 pigs did not receive treatment. All pigs were intravenously injected with Evans Blue to assess disruption of the blood-brain barrier. The degree of inflammation was estimated by use of a histological score (ISC) based on the extent of the inflammation in the pericystic areas as assessed in an image composed of several photomicrographs taken at 40X amplification. Parenchymal cysticerci provoked a significantly greater level of pericystic inflammation (higher ISC) after antiparasitic treatment compared to meningeal and corticomeningeal cysticerci. ISC of meningeal cysticerci was not significantly affected by treatment. In corticomeningeal cysticerci, the increase in ISC score was correlated to the extent of the cysticercus adjacent to the brain parenchyma. Disruption of the blood-brain barrier was associated with treatment only in parenchymal tissue. Significance Inflammatory response to cysticerci located in the meninges was significantly decreased compared to parenchymal cysticerci. The suboptimal inflammatory response to cysticidal drugs may be the reason subarachnoid NCC is generally refractory to treatment compared to parenchymal NCC.","[Cangalaya, Carla; Marzal, Miguel; Guerra-Giraldez, Cristina; Mahanty, Siddhartha; Nash, Theodore E.] Univ Peruana Cayetano Heredia, Fac Ciencias & Filosofia, Lab Inmunopatol Neurocisticercosis, Lima, Peru; [Zimic, Mirko] Univ Peruana Cayetano Heredia, Fac Ciencias & Filosofia, Lab Bioinformat & Biol Mol, Lima, Peru; [Zimic, Mirko; Guerra-Giraldez, Cristina; Garcia, Hector H.] Univ Peruana Cayetano Heredia, Fac Ciencias & Filosofia, Dept Ciencias Celulares & Mol, Lima, Peru; [Gonzalez, Armando E.] Univ Nacl Mayor San Marcos, Fac Med Vet, Lima 14, Peru; [Mahanty, Siddhartha; Nash, Theodore E.] NIAID, Parasit Dis Lab, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; [Garcia, Hector H.] Inst Nacl Ciencias Neurol, Unidad Cisticercosis, Lima, Peru","Cangalaya, C (reprint author), Univ Peruana Cayetano Heredia, Fac Ciencias & Filosofia, Lab Inmunopatol Neurocisticercosis, Lima, Peru.",carla.cangalaya.l@upch.pe,,"Mahanty, Siddhartha/0000-0003-1068-0524; Cangalaya, Carla/0000-0002-3525-8445; Guerra-Giraldez, Cristina/0000-0002-9287-9838; Gonzalez, Armando/0000-0003-1909-1873","Fogarty International Center, National Institutes of health, USA [D43 TW001140, 2D43 TW007393]; Intramural Research Program of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases","This work was partially supported by grants D43 TW001140 and 2D43 TW007393 from the Fogarty International Center, National Institutes of health, USA, and by the Intramural Research Program of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.

L. tropica), which causes cutaneous leishmaniasis in Maghreb, was recently described in this region and identified as a subpopulation of L. tropica. The present genetic analysis was conducted to explore the spatio-temporal distribution of L. killicki (syn. L. tropica) and its transmission dynamics. To better understand the evolution of this parasite, its population structure was then compared with that of L. tropica populations from Morocco. In total 198 samples including 85 L. killicki (syn. L. tropica) (from Tunisia, Algeria and Libya) and 113 L. tropica specimens (all from Morocco) were tested. Theses samples were composed of 168 Leishmania strains isolated from human skin lesions, 27 DNA samples from human skin lesion biopsies, two DNA samples from Ctenodactylus gundi bone marrow and one DNA sample from a Phlebotomus sergenti female. The sample was analyzed by using MultiLocus Enzyme Electrophoresis (MLEE) and MultiLocus Microsatellite Typing (MLMT) approaches. Analysis of the MLMT data support the hypothesis that L. killicki (syn. L. tropica) belongs to the L. tropica complex, despite its strong genetic differentiation, and that it emerged from this taxon by a founder effect. Moreover, it revealed a strong structuring in L. killicki (syn. L. tropica) between Tunisia and Algeria and within the different Tunisian regions, suggesting low dispersion of L. killicki (syn. L. tropica) in space and time. Comparison of the L. tropica (exclusively from Morocco) and L. killicki (syn. L. tropica) population structures revealed distinct genetic organizations, reflecting different epidemiological cycles.","[Chaara, Dhekra; Haouas, Najoua; Mezhoud, Habib; Babba, Hamouda] Univ Monastir, Fac Pharm, Lab Parasitol Mycol Med & Mol Code LR12ES08, Dept Biol Clin B, Monastir, Tunisia; [Chaara, Dhekra; Talignani, Loic; Lami, Patrick; Dedet, Jean-Pierre] Univ Montpellier, CHRU Montpellier, Ctr Natl Reference Leishmanioses, Dept Parasitol Mycol, F-34059 Montpellier, France; [Chaara, Dhekra; Banuls, Anne-Laure; Talignani, Loic; Lami, Patrick; Dedet, Jean-Pierre; Pratlong, Francine] Univ Montpellier, CNRS 5290, IRD 224, UMR MIVEGEC, F-34059 Montpellier, France; [Haouas, Najoua] Univ Hail, Coll Appl Med Sci, Clin Lab Sci Dept, Hail, Saudi Arabia; [Harrat, Zoubir] Inst Pasteur Algerie, Lab Ecoepidemiol Parasitaire & Genet Populat, Dely Ibrahim, Algeria","Chaara, D (reprint author), Univ Monastir, Fac Pharm, Lab Parasitol Mycol Med & Mol Code LR12ES08, Dept Biol Clin B, Monastir, Tunisia.",chaara.dhekra@yahoo.fr,,"Banuls, Anne-Laure/0000-0002-2106-8667",Institut Francais de Cooperation de Tunisie fellowship,"This study was funded by the Institut Francais de Cooperation de Tunisie fellowship for PhD students.

These antibodies, though initially protective, decline during the first year of life to levels thought to be disease enhancing, before reaching undetectable levels. Infants have long been studied to understand the interaction between infection and disease on an individual level. Methods/Findings Considering infants (cases < 1 year old) as a unique group, we analyzed serotype specific dengue case data from patients admitted to a pediatric hospital in Bangkok, Thailand. We show differences in the propensity of serotypes to cause disease in individuals with dengue antibodies (infants and post-primary cases) and in individuals without dengue antibodies (primary cases). The mean age of infant cases differed among serotypes, consistent with previously observed differential waning of maternal antibody titers by serotype. We show that trends over time in epidemiology of infant cases are consistent with those observed in the whole population, and therefore with trends in the force of infection. Conclusions/Significance Infants with dengue are informative about the interaction between antibody and the dengue serotypes, confirming that in this population DENV-2 and DENV-4 almost exclusively cause disease in the presence of dengue antibody despite infections occurring in others. We also observe differences between the serotypes in the mean age in infant cases, informative about the interaction between waning immunity and disease for the different serotypes in infants. In addition, we show that the mean age of infant cases over time is informative about transmission in the whole population. Therefore, ongoing surveillance for dengue in infants could provide useful insights into dengue epidemiology, particularly after the introduction of a dengue vaccine targeting adults and older children.","[Clapham, Hannah; Cummings, Derek A.

The nonspecific clinical presentation of many infections that cause fever makes it difficult to distinguish one from another based on clinical history and physical examination alone. Beyond malaria diagnostics, laboratory assays for many febrile diseases are often complex, costly, and may have limitations of sensitivity and specificity. Consequently, they are not widely available in low-resource areas where epidemiologic information on the etiology of febrile illness is sparse. Undifferentiated fever is the main clinical feature of many diseases of global importance, including malaria, invasive bacterial diseases, several bacterial zoonoses, and many viral infections [3]. The World Health Organization (WHO) Foodborne Diseases Epidemiology Reference Group (FERG) is tasked with estimating burden of disease for conditions transmitted by food [4]. The vast majority of enteric conditions transmitted by food are associated with diarrhea, a syndromic grouping or ""envelope"" that can in turn be broken down by diarrhea-associated pathogen. However, a number of foodborne diseases are associated with fever rather than diarrhea, and the absence of a febrile illness ""envelope"" requires novel approaches to burden of disease estimation. Examples of such foodborne diseases presenting predominantly as febrile illnesses include typhoid and paratyphoid fevers, invasive non-typhoidal Salmonella disease, brucellosis, and listeriosis. It is likely that food safety interventions could have a substantial impact on the global burden of febrile illness [5]. Here, we describe some of the challenges and potential solutions to estimating burden of febrile conditions, including those transmitted by contaminated food.","[Crump, John A.] Univ Otago, Ctr Int Hlth, Dunedin, New Zealand; [Kirk, Martyn D.] Australian Natl Univ, Res Sch Populat Hlth, Natl Ctr Epidemiol & Populat Hlth, Canberra, ACT, Australia","Crump, JA (reprint author), Univ Otago, Ctr Int Hlth, Dunedin, New Zealand.",john.crump@otago.ac.nz,,"Kirk, Martyn/0000-0001-5432-5984","US National Institutes of Health [R01 TW009237]; UK Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council [BB/J010367, BB/L017679, BB/L018926, BB/L018845]; Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council [BB/L017679/1, BB/L018926/1, BB/L018845/1]","JAC is supported by US National Institutes of Health (www.nih.gov) grant R01 TW009237 and by UK Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (http://www.bbsrc.ac.uk/) grants BB/J010367, BB/L017679, BB/L018926, and BB/L018845.

Early diagnosis and timely treatment influences the outcome of dengue illness, as delay in care-seeking is significantly associated with complications leading to severe dengue. We aimed to understand patterns of health seeking behaviour (HSB) in individuals exposed to high dengue incidence in order to improve early attendance to health centres. Methods Between September 2013 and February 2014 a cross-sectional household survey was performed in Maracay, Venezuela. Intended HSB of adults and children's parents/guardians was assessed with respect to fever or suspected dengue. Data was collected through structured questionnaires from 105 individuals. Results Most individuals felt at risk of dengue and believed it could be a deadly disease. In the case of suspected dengue, the majority (60%) would choose to first seek medical help versus first treating at home, in contrast to 11% in the case of fever. Amongst those who decided to visit a doctor, a suspected dengue infection would prompt them to search medical help earlier than if having only fever (p< 0.001). Multivariate analysis modelling showed that the independent factors associated with the intention to firstly visit a doctor versus treating at home in the case of dengue were feeling at risk (OR = 3.29; p = 0.042) and being an adult (as opposed to caring for a child as a parent/guardian; OR = 3.33, p = 0.021), while having had a previous dengue infection (OR = 0.29; p = 0.031) and living in the neighbourhood Cana de Azucar (OR = 0.28, p = 0.038) were negatively associated with seeking medical care as their first action. Conclusion Knowledge of HSB related to dengue is scarce in the Americas, our study attempts to contribute to a better understanding of HSB in this region. Improving early dengue disease recognition and awareness may enhance prompt attendance to medical care in affected populations and thereby reduce mortality and severity of dengue. Especially for those with a previous dengue infection, efforts have to be made to promote prompt health centre attendance.","[Elsinga, Jelte; Lizarazo, Erley F.; Vincenti, Maria F.; Schmidt, Masja; Velasco-Salas, Zoraida I.; Tami, Adriana] Univ Groningen, Univ Med Ctr Groningen, Dept Med Microbiol, Groningen, Netherlands; [Lizarazo, Erley F.; Vincenti, Maria F.; Arias, Luzlexis] Univ Carabobo, Inst Invest Biomed, Maracay, Venezuela; [Velasco-Salas, Zoraida I.] Univ Carabobo, Dept Biol, Fac Expt Ciencia & Tecnol, Valencia, Venezuela; [Bailey, Ajay] Univ Groningen, Fac Spatial Sci, Populat Res Ctr, Groningen, Netherlands; [Tami, Adriana] Univ Carabobo, Fac Ciencias Salud, Dept Parasitol, Valencia, Venezuela","Elsinga, J (reprint author), Univ Groningen, Univ Med Ctr Groningen, Dept Med Microbiol, Groningen, Netherlands.",a.tami@umcg.nl,,"Lizarazo, Erley/0000-0003-2749-9780; Elsinga, Jelte/0000-0003-2733-4820","Fondo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia e Innovacion (FONACIT) of the Ministerio del Poder Popular para Ciencia, Teconologia e Industrias Intermedias (MPPCTII, Venezuelan Ministry of Science, Technology and Intermediate Industries), Venezuela [201100129, 201300201]; University Medical Center Groningen (UMCG), University of Groningen, Groningen, The Netherlands; UMCG, University of Groningen, Groningen, The Netherlands","This work was supported by the Fondo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia e Innovacion (FONACIT) of the Ministerio del Poder Popular para Ciencia, Teconologia e Industrias Intermedias (MPPCTII, Venezuelan Ministry of Science, Technology and Intermediate Industries), Venezuela [201100129, 201300201] and by the University Medical Center Groningen (UMCG), University of Groningen, Groningen, The Netherlands.

The surface of Leishmania parasites is covered in a dense glycocalyx consisting of primarily lipophosphoglycan (LPG) and other phosphoglycan-containing molecules (PGs), making these glycoconjugates the likely pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPS) responsible for IL12 induction. Methodology/Principal Findings Here we explored the role of parasite glycoconjugates on the hDC IL12 response by generating L. major Friedlin V1 mutants defective in LPG alone, (FV1 lpg1-), or generally deficient for all PGs, (FV1 lpg2-). Infection with metacyclic, infective stage, L. major or purified LPG induced high levels of IL12B subunit gene transcripts in hDCs, which was abrogated with FV1 lpg1-infections. In contrast, hDC infections with FV1 lpg2-displayed increased IL12B expression, suggesting other PG-related/LPG2 dependent molecules may act to dampen the immune response. Global transcriptional profiling comparing WT, FV1 lpg1-, FV1 lpg2-infections revealed that FV1 lpg1-mutants entered hDCs in a silent fashion as indicated by repression of gene expression. Transcription factor binding site analysis suggests that LPG recognition by hDCs induces IL-12 in a signaling cascade resulting in Nuclear Factor kappa B (NF kappa B) and Interferon Regulatory Factor (IRF) mediated transcription. Conclusions/Significance These data suggest that L. major LPG is a major PAMP recognized by hDC to induce IL12-mediated protective immunity and that there is a complex interplay between PG-baring Leishmania surface glycoconjugates that result in modulation of host cellular IL12.","[Favila, Michelle A.; Geraci, Nicholas S.; Jayakumar, Asha; Mostrom, Janet; McDowell, Mary Ann] Univ Notre Dame, Eck Inst Global Hlth, Dept Biol Sci, Notre Dame, IN 46556 USA; [Hickerson, Suzanne; Beverley, Stephen M.] Washington Univ, Sch Med, Dept Mol Microbiol, St Louis, MO 63110 USA; [Turco, Salvatore J.] Univ Kentucky, Coll Med, Dept Biochem, Lexington, KY 40536 USA","Favila, MA (reprint author), Univ Notre Dame, Eck Inst Global Hlth, Dept Biol Sci, Notre Dame, IN 46556 USA.",mcdowell.11@nd.edu,,"Geraci, Nicholas/0000-0003-4294-9188; Beverley, Stephen/0000-0001-5319-0811",National Institutes of of Allergy and Infectious Diseases [R01AI056242]; NIH [RO1AI31078]; National Institute of General Medical Sciences [T32GM075762],"This work was supported by National Institutes of of Allergy and Infectious Diseases grants R01AI056242 (MAM) and NIH RO1AI31078 (SMB, SJT).

Immucillins are compared to the Glucantime standard drug in the chemotherapy of Leishmania (L.) infantum chagasi infection in mice and hamsters. These agents are tested for toxicity and immune system response. Methodology/Principal Findings BALB/c mice were infected with 10(7) amastigotes, treated with IA, IH, SMIH or Glucantime (2.5mg/kg/day) and monitored for clinical variables, parasite load, antibody levels and splenocyte IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha, and IL-10 expression. Cytokines and CD4+, CD8+ and CD19+ lymphocyte frequencies were assessed in uninfected controls and in response to immucillins. Urea, creatinine, GOT and GPT levels were monitored in sera. Anti-Leishmania-specific IgG1 antibodies (anti-NH36) increased in untreated animals. IgG2a response, high levels of IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha and lower levels of IL-10 were detected in mice treated with the immucillins and Glucantime. Immucillins permitted normal weight gain, prevented hepato-splenomegaly and cleared the parasite infection (85-89%) without renal and hepatic toxicity. Immucillins promoted 35% lower secretion of IFN-gamma in uninfected controls than in infected mice. IA and IH increased the CD4+ T and CD19+ B cell frequencies. SMIH increased only the proportion of CD-19 B cells. IA and IH also cured infected hamsters with lower toxicity than Glucantime. Conclusions/Significance Immucillins IA, IH and SMIH were effective in treating leishmaniasis in mice. In hamsters, IA and IH were also effective. The highest therapeutic efficacy was obtained with IA, possibly due to its induction of a TH1 immune response. Low immucillin doses were required and showed no toxicity. Our results disclose the potential use of IA and IH in the therapy of visceral leishmaniasis.","[Freitas, Elisangela Oliveira; Nico, Dirlei; Alves-Silva, Marcus Vinicius; Palatnik-de-Sousa, Clarisa B.] Univ Fed Rio de Janeiro, Dept Microbiol Geral, Inst Microbiol Paulo Goes, Rio De Janeiro, RJ, Brazil; [Freitas, Elisangela Oliveira; Schramm, Vern L.] Yeshiva Univ, Dept Biochem, Albert Einstein Coll Med, New York, NY 10033 USA; [Morrot, Alexandre] Univ Fed Rio de Janeiro, Dept Imunol, Inst Microbiol Paulo Goes, Rio De Janeiro, RJ, Brazil; [Clinch, Keith; Evans, Gary B.; Tyler, Peter C.] Victoria Univ Wellington, Ferrier Res Inst, Wellington, New Zealand","Freitas, EO (reprint author), Univ Fed Rio de Janeiro, Dept Microbiol Geral, Inst Microbiol Paulo Goes, Rio De Janeiro, RJ, Brazil.",immgcpa@micro.ufrj.br,"Evans, Gary/I-4123-2019; Freitas, Elisangela/I-7384-2017","Evans, Gary/0000-0002-6973-2002; Palatnik-de-Sousa, Clarisa B./0000-0002-6231-0608; Clinch, Keith/0000-0002-3300-4396","Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ) [301215-2007-3, 302039/2010-4, 559756/2010-0, 404400/2012-4]; Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Rio de Janeiro (FAPERJ) [102733/2008, 102957/2011, E-26/102415/2010, E-26/110535/2010]; PROLAB Award PABMB/ASBMB PROLAB (Promoting Research Opportunities For Latin American Biochemists (PROLAB) of the American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology); NIH [GM041916]","This work has been supported by Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ, Fellowships 301215-2007-3, 302039/2010-4, 559756/2010-0 and grant 404400/2012-4), by Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Rio de Janeiro (FAPERJ, grants 102733/2008 and 102957/2011 and Fellowships E-26/102415/2010 and E-26/110535/2010) and by PROLAB Award PABMB/ASBMB PROLAB (Promoting Research Opportunities For Latin American Biochemists (PROLAB) of the American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology).

At present, the control of dengue disease is mainly hampered by the absence of antivirals or a vaccine, which results in an estimated half worldwide population at risk of infection. The immune response against DENV is not yet fully understood and a better knowledge of it is now recognized as one of the main challenge for vaccine development. In previous studies, we reported that a DNA vaccine containing the signal peptide sequence from the human tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) fused to the DENV2 NS1 gene (pcTPANS1) induced protection against dengue in mice. In the present work, we aimed to elucidate the contribution of cellular and humoral responses elicited by this vaccine candidate for protective immunity. We observed that pcTPANS1 exerts a robust protection against dengue, inducing considerable levels of anti-NS1 antibodies and T cell responses. Passive immunization with anti-NS1 antibodies conferred partial protection in mice infected with low virus load (4 LD50), which was abrogated with the increase of viral dose (40 LD50). The pcTPANS1 also induced activation of CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells. We detected production of IFN-gamma and a cytotoxic activity by CD8(+) T lymphocytes induced by this vaccine, although its contribution in the protection was not so evident when compared to CD4(+) cells. Depletion of CD4(+) cells in immunized mice completely abolished protection. Furthermore, transfer experiments revealed that animals receiving CD4(+) T cells combined with anti-NS1 antiserum, both obtained from vaccinated mice, survived virus infection with survival rates not significantly different from pcTPANS1-immunized animals. Taken together, results showed that the protective immune response induced by the expression of NS1 antigen mediated by the pcTPANS1 requires a cooperation between CD4(+) pcTPANS1-immunizedT cells and the humoral immunity.","[Goncalves, Antonio J.

This is a country case study focusing on the political economy of knowledge in Zambia. It is a pertinent time to examine this issue as human population growth and other factors have led to migration into tsetse-inhabited areas with little historical influence from livestock. Disease transmission in new human-wildlife interfaces such as these is a greater risk, and opinions on the best way to manage this are deeply divided. Methods A qualitative case study method was used to examine the narratives on trypanosomiasis in the Zambian policy context through a series of key informant interviews. Interviewees included key actors from international organisations, research organisations and local activists from a variety of perspectives acknowledging the need to explore the relationships between the human, animal and environmental sectors. Principal Findings Diverse framings are held by key actors looking from, variously, the perspectives of wildlife and environmental protection, agricultural development, poverty alleviation, and veterinary and public health. From these viewpoints, four narratives about trypanosomiasis policy were identified, focused around four different beliefs: that trypanosomiasis is protecting the environment, is causing poverty, is not a major problem, and finally, that it is a Zambian rather than international issue to contend with. Within these narratives there are also conflicting views on the best control methods to use and different reasoning behind the pathways of response. These are based on apparently incompatible priorities of people, land, animals, the economy and the environment. The extent to which a One Health approach has been embraced and the potential usefulness of this as a way of reconciling the aims of these framings and narratives is considered throughout the paper. Conclusions/Significance While there has historically been a lack of One Health working in this context, the complex, interacting factors that impact the disease show the need for cross-sector, interdisciplinary decision making to stop rival narratives leading to competing actions. Additional recommendations include implementing: surveillance to assess under-reporting of disease and consequential under-estimation of disease risk; evidence-based decision making; increased and structurally managed funding across countries; and focus on interactions between disease drivers, disease incidence at the community level, and poverty and equity impacts.","[Grant, Catherine] Univ Sussex, Inst Dev Studies, Brighton, E Sussex, England; [Anderson, Neil] Univ Edinburgh, Royal Dick Sch Vet Studies, Roslin, Midlothian, Scotland; [Machila, Noreen] Univ Zambia, Sch Vet Med, Lusaka, Zambia","Grant, C (reprint author), Univ Sussex, Inst Dev Studies, Brighton, E Sussex, England.",c.grant@ids.ac.uk,,"Anderson, Neil/0000-0001-7192-7717; Grant, Catherine/0000-0002-4926-1266","Consortium (NERC) from the Ecosystem Services for Poverty Alleviation (ESPA) programme [NE-J001570-1]; Department for International Development (DFID); Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC); Natural Environment Research Council (NERC); Natural Environment Research Council [NE/J001570/1, NE/J001422/1, NE/J000701/1]","The Consortium (NERC project no.

A large backlog of TT cases remain unidentified and untreated. To increase identification and referral of TT cases, a novel approach using standard screening questions, a card, and simple training for Community Treatment Assistants (CTAs) to use during Mass Drug Administration (MDA) was developed and evaluated in Kongwa District, a trachoma-endemic area of central Tanzania. Methodology/Principal Findings A community randomized trial was conducted in 36 communities during MDA. CTAs in intervention villages received an additional half-day of training and a TT screening card in addition to the training received by CTAs in villages assigned to usual care. All MDA participants 15 years and older were screened for TT, and senior TT graders confirmed case status by evaluating all screened-positive cases. A random sample of those screened negative for TT and those who did not present at MDA were also evaluated by the master graders. Intervention CTAs identified 5.6 times as many cases (n = 50) as those assigned to usual care (n = 9, p < 0.05). While specificity was above 90% for both groups, the sensitivity for the novel screening tool was 31.2% compared to 5.6% for the usual care group (p < 0.05). Conclusions/Significance CTAs appear to be viable resources for the identification of TT cases. Additional training and use of a TT screening card significantly increased the ability of CTAs to recognize and refer TT cases during MDA; however, further efforts are needed to improve case detection and reduce the number of false positive cases.","[Greene, Gregory S.; West, Sheila K.; Munoz, Beatriz] Johns Hopkins Univ, Wilmer Eye Inst, Dana Ctr Preventat Ophthalmol, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA; [Mkocha, Harran] Kongwa Trachoma Project, Kongwa, Tanzania; [Merbs, Shannath L.] Johns Hopkins Univ, Sch Med, Wilmer Eye Inst, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA","Greene, GS (reprint author), Johns Hopkins Univ, Wilmer Eye Inst, Dana Ctr Preventat Ophthalmol, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA.",shwest@jhmi.edu,,,Lions Club International Foundation [114468],"This work was supported by a grant from the Lions Club International Foundation, grant# 114468.

During a cholera episode, pregnant women are at high risk of complications, and the risk of fetal death has been reported to be 2-36%. Due to a lack of safety data, pregnant women have been excluded from most cholera vaccination campaigns. In 2012, reactive campaigns using the bivalent killed whole-cell oral cholera vaccine (BivWC), included all people living in the targeted areas aged >= 1 year regardless of pregnancy status, were implemented in Guinea. We aimed to determine whether there was a difference in pregnancy outcomes between vaccinated and non-vaccinated pregnant women. Methods and Findings From 11 November to 4 December 2013, we conducted a retrospective cohort study in Boffa prefecture among women who were pregnant in 2012 during or after the vaccination campaign. The primary outcome was pregnancy loss, as reported by the mother, and fetal malformations, after clinical examination. Primary exposure was the intake of the BivWC vaccine (Shanchol) during pregnancy, as determined by a vaccination card or oral history. We compared the risk of pregnancy loss between vaccinated and non-vaccinated women through binomial regression analysis. A total of 2,494 pregnancies were included in the analysis. The crude incidence of pregnancy loss was 3.7% (95% CI 2.7-4.8) for fetuses exposed to BivWC vaccine and 2.6% (0.7-4.5) for non-exposed fetuses. The incidence of malformation was 0.6% (0.1-1.0) and 1.2% (0.0-2.5) in BivWC-exposed and non-exposed fetuses, respectively. In both crude and adjusted analyses, fetal exposure to BivWC was not significantly associated with pregnancy loss (adjusted risk ratio (aRR = 1.09 [95% CI: 0.5-2.25], p = 0.818) or malformations (aRR = 0.50 [95% CI: 0.13-1.91], p = 0.314). Conclusions In this large retrospective cohort study, we found no association between fetal exposure to BivWC and risk of pregnancy loss or malformation. Despite the weaknesses of a retrospective design, we can conclude that if a risk exists, it is very low. Additional prospective studies are warranted to add to the evidence base on OCV use during pregnancy.

It finds increasing application in the study of environmentally modulated neglected tropical diseases (NTDs). Obtaining and assuring the quality of the relevant spatially and temporally indexed EO data remain challenges. Our objective was to review the Earth observation products currently used in studies of NTD epidemiology and to discuss fundamental issues relating to spatial data quality (SDQ), which limit the utilization of EO and pose challenges for its more effective use. We searched Web of Science and PubMed for studies related to EO and echinococossis, leptospirosis, schistosomiasis, and soil-transmitted helminth infections. Relevant literature was also identified from the bibliographies of those papers. We found that extensive use is made of EO products in the study of NTD epidemiology; however, the quality of these products is usually given little explicit attention. We review key issues in SDQ concerning spatial and temporal scale, uncertainty, and the documentation and use of quality information. We give examples of how these issues may interact with uncertainty in NTD data to affect the output of an epidemiological analysis. We conclude that researchers should give careful attention to SDQ when designing NTD spatial-epidemiological studies. This should be used to inform uncertainty analysis in the epidemiological study. SDQ should be documented and made available to other researchers.","[Hamm, Nicholas A.

We generated a series of single-chain antibody Fv domain (scFv) phage display libraries from the portal lymph node of field exposed water buffaloes, Bubalus bubalis, 11-12 days post challenge with Schistosoma japonicum cercariae. The selected scFv-phages showed clear enrichment towards adult schistosomes and excretory-secretory (ES) proteins by immunofluorescence, ELISA and western blot analysis. The enriched libraries were used to probe a schistosome specific protein microarray resulting in the recognition of a number of proteins, five of which were specific to schistosomes, with RNA expression predominantly in the adult life-stage based on interrogation of schistosome expressed sequence tags (EST). As the libraries were enriched by panning against ES products, these antigens may be excreted or secreted into the host vasculature and hence may make good targets for a diagnostic assay. Further selection of the scFv library against infected mouse sera identified five soluble scFv clones that could selectively recognise soluble whole adult preparations (SWAP) relative to an irrelevant protein control (ovalbumin). Furthermore, two of the identified scFv clones also selectively recognised SWAP proteins when spiked into naive mouse sera. These host B-cell derived scFvs that specifically bind to schistosome protein preparations will be valuable reagents for further development of a cost effective point-of-care diagnostic test.","[Hosking, Christopher G.; de Veer, Michael J.] Monash Univ, Dept Physiol, Clayton, Vic 3168, Australia; [McWilliam, Hamish E.

Only one ligand-receptor interaction has been identified, that between P. vivax Duffy Binding Protein (PvDBP) and the erythrocyte Duffy Antigen Receptor for Chemokines (DARC), and strain-specific immune responses to PvDBP make it a complex vaccine target. To broaden the repertoire of potential P. vivax merozoite-stage vaccine targets, we exploited a recent breakthrough in expressing fulllength ectodomains of Plasmodium proteins in a functionally-active form in mammalian cells and initiated a large-scale study of P. vivax merozoite proteins that are potentially involved in reticulocyte binding and invasion. Methodology/Principal Findings We selected 39 P. vivax proteins that are predicted to localize to the merozoite surface or invasive secretory organelles, some of which show homology to P. falciparum vaccine candidates. Of these, we were able to express 37 full-length protein ectodomains in a mammalian expression system, which has been previously used to express P. falciparum invasion ligands such as PfRH5. To establish whether the expressed proteins were correctly folded, we assessed whether they were recognized by antibodies from Cambodian patients with acute vivax malaria. IgG from these samples showed at least a two-fold change in reactivity over naive controls in 27 of 34 antigens tested, and the majority showed heat-labile IgG immunoreactivity, suggesting the presence of conformation-sensitive epitopes and native tertiary protein structures. Using a method specifically designed to detect low-affinity, extracellular protein-protein interactions, we confirmed a predicted interaction between P. vivax 6-cysteine proteins P12 and P41, further suggesting that the proteins are natively folded and functional. This screen also identified two novel protein-protein interactions, between P12 and PVX_110945, and between MSP3.10 and MSP7.1, the latter of which was confirmed by surface plasmon resonance. Conclusions/Significance We produced a new library of recombinant full-length P. vivax ectodomains, established that the majority of them contain tertiary structure, and used them to identify predicted and novel protein-protein interactions. As well as identifying new interactions for further biological studies, this library will be useful in identifying P. vivax proteins with vaccine potential, and studying P. vivax malaria pathogenesis and immunity.

Here we investigate possible modes of action against Trypanosoma brucei using orthogonal chemo-proteomic and genomic approaches. SILAC-based proteomic studies using an oxaborole analogue immobilised onto a resin was used either in competition with a soluble oxaborole or an immobilised inactive control to identify thirteen proteins common to both strategies. Cell-cycle analysis of cells incubated with sub-lethal concentrations of an oxaborole identified a subtle but significant accumulation of G2 and >G2 cells. Given the possibility of compromised DNA fidelity, we investigated long-term exposure of T. brucei to oxaboroles by generating resistant cell lines in vitro. Resistance proved more difficult to generate than for drugs currently used in the field, and in one of our three cell lines was unstable. Whole-genome sequencing of the resistant cell lines revealed single nucleotide polymorphisms in 66 genes and several large-scale genomic aberrations. The absence of a simple consistent mechanism among resistant cell lines and the diverse list of binding partners from the proteomic studies suggest a degree of polypharmacology that should reduce the risk of resistance to this compound class emerging in the field. The combined genetic and chemical biology approaches have provided lists of candidates to be investigated for more detailed information on the mode of action of this promising new drug class.","[Jones, Deuan C.; Patterson, Stephen; Ong, Han B.; Fairlamb, Alan H.] Univ Dundee, Sch Life Sci, Dundee, Scotland; [Foth, Bernardo J.] Wellcome Trust Sanger Inst, Parasite Genom, Cambridge, England; [Urbaniak, Michael D.; Berriman, Matthew] Univ Lancaster, Div Biomed & Life Sci, Lancaster, England","Jones, DC (reprint author), Univ Dundee, Sch Life Sci, Dundee, Scotland.",a.h.fairlamb@dundee.ac.uk,"Berriman, Matthew/A-7618-2011; Fairlamb, Alan/A-5272-2009","Berriman, Matthew/0000-0002-9581-0377; Fairlamb, Alan/0000-0001-5134-0329; Urbaniak, Michael/0000-0003-2745-9420; Ong, Han/0000-0003-3369-8196","Wellcome Trust [079838, 098051]; BBSRC [BB/M009556/1]; Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council [BB/M009556/1]","This work was funded by the Wellcome Trust http://www.wellcome.ac.uk/ (079838 to AHF; 098051 to the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute).

With an endemic area greater than 13 million km2 and millions of people at risk, scrub typhus remains an underreported, often misdiagnosed febrile illness. A comprehensive, updatable map of the true distribution of cases has been lacking, and therefore the true risk of disease within the very large endemic area remains unknown. The purpose of this study was to establish a database and map to track human scrub typhus. An online search using PubMed and the United States Armed Forces Pest Management Board Literature Retrieval System was performed to identify articles describing human scrub typhus cases both within and outside the traditionally accepted endemic regions. Using World Health Organization guidelines, stringent criteria were used to establish diagnoses for inclusion in the database. The preliminary screening of 181 scrub typhus publications yielded 145 publications that met the case criterion, 267 case records, and 13 serosurvey records that could be georeferenced, describing 13,739 probable or confirmed human cases in 28 countries. A map service has been established within VectorMap (www.vectormap.org) to explore the role that relative location of vectors, hosts, and the pathogen play in the transmission of mite-borne scrub typhus.

Yet risk of reinfection and recurrent disease remain, even in areas with high treatment coverage. In the search for means to better prevent new Schistosoma infections, attention has returned to an older strategy for transmission control, i.e., chemical mollusciciding, to suppress intermediate host snail species responsible for S. mansoni and S. haematobium transmission. The objective of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to summarize prior experience in molluscicide-based control of Bulinus and Biomphalaria spp. snails, and estimate its impact on local human Schistosoma infection. Methodology/Principal Findings The review was registered at inception with PROSPERO (CRD42013006869). Studies were identified by online database searches and hand searches of private archives. Eligible studies included published or unpublished mollusciciding field trials performed before January 2014 involving host snails for S. mansoni or S. haematobium, with a primary focus on the use of niclosamide. Among 63 included papers, there was large variability in terms of molluscicide dosing, and treatment intervals varied from 3-52 weeks depending on location, water source, and type of application. Among 35 studies reporting on prevalence, random effects meta-analysis indicated that, on average, odds of infection were reduced 77% (OR 0.23, CI95% 0.17, 0.31) during the course of mollusciciding, with increased impact if combined with drug therapy, and progressively greater impact over time. In 17 studies reporting local incidence, risk of new infection was reduced 64% (RR 0.36 CI95% 0.25, 0.5), but additional drug treatment did not appear to influence incidence effects. Conclusion/Significance While there are hurdles to implementing molluscicide control, its impact on local transmission is typically strong, albeit incomplete. Based on past experience, regular focal mollusciciding is likely to contribute significantly to the move toward elimination of schistosomiasis in high risk areas.","[King, Charles H.; Sutherland, Laura J.; Bertsch, David] Case Western Reserve Univ, Ctr Global Hlth & Dis, Cleveland, OH 44106 USA; [King, Charles H.] Univ Georgia, Schistosomiasis Consortium Operat Res & Evaluat, Athens, GA 30602 USA; [Bertsch, David] Case Western Reserve Univ, Dept Biol, Cleveland, OH 44106 USA","King, CH (reprint author), Case Western Reserve Univ, Ctr Global Hlth & Dis, Cleveland, OH 44106 USA.",chk@cwru.edu,,"King, Charles/0000-0001-8349-9270","Schistosomiasis Consortium for Operational Research and Evaluation (SCORE) based at the University of Georgia, USA","This work was sponsored by the Schistosomiasis Consortium for Operational Research and Evaluation (SCORE) based at the University of Georgia, USA.

To identify factors associated with on-time, delayed, or missed mass drug administration (MDA) interventions, and explore possible indicators for supply chain performance for drug donation programs, we reviewed program data for the 14 STH-endemic countries CWW supported during 2007-2012. Methodology Data from drug applications, shipping records, and annual treatment reports were tracked using Microsoft Excel. Qualitative data from interviews with key personnel were used to provide additional context on the causes of delayed or missed MDAs. Four possible contributory factors to delayed or missed MDAs were considered: production, shipping, customs clearance, and miscellaneous in-country issues. Coverage rates were calculated by dividing the number of treatments administered by the number of children targeted during the MDA. Principal Findings Of the approved requests for 78 MDAs, 54 MDAs (69%) were successfully implemented during or before the scheduled month. Ten MDAs (13%) were classified as delayed; seven of these were delayed by one month or less. An additional 14 MDAs (18%) were classified as missed. For the 64 on-time or delayed MDAs, the mean coverage was approximately 88%. Conclusions and Significance To continue to assess the supply chain processes and identify areas for improvement, we identified four indicators or metrics for supply chain performance that can be applied across all neglected tropical disease (NTD) drug donation programs: (1) donor having available inventory to satisfy the country request for donation; (2) donor shipping the approved number of doses; (3) shipment arriving at the Central Medical Stores one month in advance of the scheduled MDA date; and (4) country programs implementing the MDA as scheduled.","[Koporc, Kimberly M.; Strunz, Eric; Holloway, Cassandra; Addiss, David G.] Task Force Global Hlth, Children Worms, Decatur, GA 30030 USA; [Lin, William] Johnson & Johnson, New Brunswick, NJ USA","Koporc, KM (reprint author), Task Force Global Hlth, Children Worms, Decatur, GA 30030 USA.",kkoporc@taskforce.org,,,,,,2,0,0,0,14,PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE,SAN FRANCISCO,"1160 BATTERY STREET, STE 100, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94111 USA",1935-2735,,,PLOS NEGLECT TROP D,Plos Neglect.

During early infancy, severe dengue can develop after a primary dengue virus infection. There has been a clinical observation that severe dengue during the first year of life is seen only in chubby infants. Methodology/Principal Findings We examined the associations between the development of severe dengue and adipose tissue accumulation patterns during the first year of life in a prospective observational clinical study of infants and dengue virus infections. We found that adipose tissue contains two potential targets for dengue virus infection and production-adipocytes and adipose tissue macrophages. During the first year of life, total body adiposity and visceral adipose tissue stores were at their highest levels in early infancy. Early infancy was also characterized by a relative decrease in alternatively activated (anti-inflammatory) macrophages, and a relative increase in circulating pro-inflammatory cytokines. Conclusions/Significance The data has been used to propose a model where the adipose tissue accumulation pattern and pro-inflammatory environment during early infancy provide the conditions for the potential development of severe dengue in immune-susceptible infants.","[Libraty, Daniel H.; Guo, Zhiru] Univ Massachusetts, Sch Med, Dept Med, Div Infect Dis & Immunol, Worcester, MA 01655 USA; [Wang, Pengyan] Shihezi Univ, Coll Anim Sci & Technol, Shihezi, Peoples R China; [Bigcas, Venelle; Capeding, Rosario Z.] Res Inst Trop Med, Dept Med, Manila, Philippines; [Brion, Job D.] San Pablo City Hlth Dept, San Pablo, Laguna, Philippines","Libraty, DH (reprint author), Univ Massachusetts, Sch Med, Dept Med, Div Infect Dis & Immunol, Worcester, MA 01655 USA.",daniel.libraty@umassmed.edu,,,National Institutes of Health/National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases [R01 AI091820],"This work was supported by a grant from the National Institutes of Health/National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases R01 AI091820.

It has been described that to survive in the human host, fungi must also tolerate and overcome in vivo microenvironmental stress conditions including low oxygen tension; however nothing is known how Paracoccidioides species respond to hypoxia. The genus Paracoccidioides comprises human thermal dimorphic fungi and are causative agents of paracoccidioidomycosis (PCM), an important mycosis in Latin America. Methodology/Principal Findings In this work, a detailed hypoxia characterization was performed in Paracoccidioides. Using NanoUPLC-MSE proteomic approach, we obtained a total of 288 proteins differentially regulated in 12 and 24 h of hypoxia, providing a global view of metabolic changes during this stress. In addition, a functional characterization of the homologue to the most important molecule involved in hypoxia responses in other fungi, the SREBP (sterol regulatory element binding protein) was performed. We observed that Paracoccidioides species have a functional homologue of SREBP, named here as SrbA, detected by using a heterologous genetic approach in the srbA null mutant in Aspergillus fumigatus. Paracoccidioides srbA (PbsrbA), in addition to involvement in hypoxia, is probable involved in iron adaptation and azole drug resistance responses. Conclusions/Significance In this study, the hypoxia was characterized in Paracoccidioides. The first results can be important for a better understanding of the fungal adaptation to the host and improve the arsenal of molecules for the development of alternative treatment options in future, since molecules related to fungal adaptation to low oxygen levels are important to virulence and pathogenesis in human pathogenic fungi.","[Lima, Patricia de Sousa; Bailao, Alexandre Melo; de Almeida Soares, Celia Maria] Univ Fed Goias, Inst Ciencias Biol, Mol Biol Lab, Goiania, Go, Brazil; [Chung, Dawoon; Cramer, Robert A.] Geisel Sch Med Dartmouth, Dept Microbiol & Immunol, Hanover, NH USA","Lima, PD (reprint author), Univ Fed Goias, Inst Ciencias Biol, Mol Biol Lab, Goiania, Go, Brazil.",cmasoares@gmail.com,"Bailao, Alexandre/H-1272-2013","Bailao, Alexandre/0000-0001-7754-4047; Cramer, Robert/0000-0001-5503-5006","Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico, [CNPq] [442213/2014-0, 304810/2014-2]; Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Goias [FAPEG] [201210267001055, 201410267001224]; National Institute Of General Medical Sciences of the National Institutes of Health [NIH] [P30GM106394]; NIH/National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases [R01AI81838]; Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior [CAPES]","This work at Universidade Federal de Goias was supported by grants from Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico, [CNPq] (http://www.cnpq.br), grant numbers: 442213/2014-0 and 304810/2014-2; Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Goias [FAPEG] (http://www.fapeg.go.gov.br/sitefapeg), grant numbers: 201210267001055 and 201410267001224; National Institute Of General Medical Sciences of the National Institutes of Health [NIH],(http://www.nigms.nih.gov/Pages/default.aspx), grant number: P30GM106394 (Stanton, Bruce PI, pilot project RAC) and NIH/National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, (http://www.niaid.nih.gov/Pages/default.aspx), grant number R01AI81838 (RAC PI).

Ultrasonography (US) provides objective measurements of nerve thickening and asymmetry. We examined leprosy patients before beginning multi-drug therapy aiming to describe differences in US measurements between classification groups and between patients with and without reactions. Methodology/Principal Findings Eleven paucibacillary (PB) and 85 multibacillary (MB) patients underwent nerve US. Twenty-seven patients had leprosy reactions (type 1, type 2 and/or acute neuritis) prior to US. The ulnar (at the cubital tunnel-Ut-and proximal to the tunnel-Upt), median (M) and common fibular (CF) nerves were scanned to measure cross-sectional areas (CSAs) in mm(2) and to calculate the asymmetry indexes Delta CSA (absolute difference between right and left CSAs) and.Utpt (absolute difference between Upt and Ut CSAs). MB patients showed greater (p<0.05) CSAs than PB at Ut (13.88 +/- 11.4/9.53 +/- 6.14) and M (10.41 +/- 5.4/6.36 +/- 0.84). Delta CSAs and Delta Utpt were similar between PB and MB. The CSAs, Delta CSAs and Delta Utpt were similar between PB patients with reactions compared to PB patients without reactions. MB patients with reactions showed significantly greater CSAs (Upt, Ut and M), Delta CSAs (Upt and Ut) and Delta Utpt compared to MB patients without reactions. PB and MB showed similar frequencies of abnormal US measurements. Patients with reactions had higher frequency of nerve thickening and similar frequency of asymmetry to those without reactions. Conclusions/Significance This is the first study to investigate differences in nerve involvement among leprosy classification groups using US before treatment. The magnitude of thickening was greater in MB and in patients with reactions. Asymmetry indexes were greater in patients with reactions and did not significantly differ between PB and MB, demonstrating that asymmetry is a characteristic of leprosy neuropathy regardless of its classification.","[Lugao, Helena Barbosa; Foss, Norma Tiraboschi; Cipriani Frade, Marco Andrey] Univ Sao Paulo, Ribeirao Preto Med Sch, Dept Internal Med, Div Dermatol, BR-14049 Ribeirao Preto, SP, Brazil; [Nogueira-Barbosa, Marcello Henrique] Univ Sao Paulo, Ribeirao Preto Med Sch, Dept Internal Med, Div Radiol, BR-14049 Ribeirao Preto, SP, Brazil; [Marques, Wilson, Jr.] Univ Sao Paulo, Ribeirao Preto Med Sch, Dept Neurol, BR-14049 Ribeirao Preto, SP, Brazil","Lugao, HB (reprint author), Univ Sao Paulo, Ribeirao Preto Med Sch, Dept Internal Med, Div Dermatol, BR-14049 Ribeirao Preto, SP, Brazil.",helenalugao@hotmail.com,"Marques, Wilson/G-4240-2012; Frade, Marco/G-1165-2012; Nogueira-Barbosa, Marcello/L-3418-2019; Nogueira-Barbosa, Marcello H/D-7681-2012","Marques, Wilson/0000-0002-4589-2749; Frade, Marco/0000-0003-2700-5971; Nogueira-Barbosa, Marcello/0000-0002-7436-5315; Nogueira-Barbosa, Marcello H/0000-0002-7436-5315","Comissao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal do Nivel Superior (CAPES); Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo (FAPESP); Ministerio da Saude/Fundacao de Apoio ao Ensino, Pesquisa e Assistencia do Hospital das Clinicas da Faculdade de Medicina de Ribeirao Preto da Universidade de Sao Paulo (MS/FAEPA-FMRP-USP); Financiadora de Estudos e Projetos (FINEP)","HBL received a scholarship from Comissao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal do Nivel Superior (CAPES).

Mass drug administration with ivermectin is a promising strategy for the control of scabies. Mass treatment with ivermectin followed by active case finding was conducted in five communities in the Solomon Islands between 1997 and 2000 and resulted in a significant reduction in the prevalence of both scabies and bacterial skin infections. Methods We conducted a prospective follow-up study of the communities where the original scabies control programme had been undertaken. All residents underwent a standardised examination for the detection of scabies and impetigo. Results Three hundred and thirty eight residents were examined, representing 69% of the total population of the five communities. Only 1 case of scabies was found, in an adult who had recently returned from the mainland. The prevalence of active impetigo was 8.8% overall and 12.4% in children aged 12 years or less. Discussion We found an extremely low prevalence of scabies 15 years after the cessation of a scabies control programme. The prevalence of impetigo had also declined further since the end of the control programme. Our results suggest that a combination of mass treatment with ivermectin and intensive active case finding may result in long term control of scabies. Larger scale studies and integration with other neglected tropical disease control programmes should be priorities for scabies control efforts.","[Marks, Michael; Mabey, David C.] London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, Fac Infect & Trop Dis, Dept Clin Res, London WC1, England; [Marks, Michael; Mabey, David C.] Univ Coll London Hosp NHS Trust, Hosp Trop Dis, London, England; [Taotao-Wini, Betty; Nasi, Titus] Natl Referral Hosp, Dept Paediat, Minist Hlth & Med Serv, Honiara, Solomon Islands; [Satorara, Lorraine] Minist Hlth & Med Serv, Natl Hlth Training Res Inst, Honiara, Solomon Islands; [Engelman, Daniel; Steer, Andrew C.] Univ Melbourne, Ctr Int Child Hlth, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Engelman, Daniel; Steer, Andrew C.] Royal Childrens Hosp, Dept Gen Med, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Engelman, Daniel; Steer, Andrew C.] Murdoch Childrens Res Inst, Grp Streptococcal Res Grp, Melbourne, Vic, Australia","Marks, M (reprint author), London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, Fac Infect & Trop Dis, Dept Clin Res, London WC1, England.",michael.marks@lshtm.ac.uk,"Engelman, Daniel/Q-2170-2019","Engelman, Daniel/0000-0002-4909-1287; Marks, Michael/0000-0002-7585-4743",Wellcome Trust [WT 102807]; National Health and Medical Research Council Fellowship,"MM is supported by a Wellcome Trust Clinical Research Fellowship (WT 102807).

However, the disease is not routinely diagnosed in the continent. One of major factors limiting diagnosis is the poor availability of live isolates of locally circulating Leptospira serovars for inclusion in the antigen panel of the gold standard microscopic agglutination test (MAT) for detecting antibodies against leptospirosis. To gain insight in Leptospira serovars and their natural hosts occurring in Tanzania, concomitantly enabling the improvement of the MAT by inclusion of fresh local isolates, a total of 52 Leptospira isolates were obtained from fresh urine and kidney homogenates, collected between 1996 and 2006 from small mammals, cattle and pigs. Isolates were identified by serogrouping, cross agglutination absorption test (CAAT), and molecular typing. Common Leptospira serovars with their respective animal hosts were: Sokoine (cattle and rodents); Kenya (rodents and shrews); Mwogolo (rodents); Lora (rodents); Qunjian (rodent); serogroup Grippotyphosa (cattle); and an unknown serogroup from pigs. Inclusion of local serovars particularly serovar Sokoine in MAT revealed a 10-fold increase in leptospirosis prevalence in Tanzania from 1.9% to 16.9% in rodents and 0.26% to 10.75% in humans. This indicates that local serovars are useful for diagnosis of human and animal leptospirosis in Tanzania and other African countries.","[Mgode, Georgies F.; Machang'u, Robert S.; Mhamphi, Ginethon G.; Katakweba, Abdul; Mulungu, Loth S.] Sokoine Univ Agr, Ctr Pest Management, Morogoro, Tanzania; [Durnez, Lies] Inst Trop Med, Dept Biomed Sci, B-2000 Antwerp, Belgium; [Leirs, Herwig] Univ Antwerp, Evolutionary Ecol Grp, B-2020 Antwerp, Belgium; [Hartskeerl, Rudy A.] WHO, Royal Trop Inst KIT, KIT Biomed Res, FAO,OIE, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Hartskeerl, Rudy A.] Natl Collaborating Ctr Reference & Res Leptospiro, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Belmain, Steven R.] Univ Greenwich, Nat Resources Inst, London SE18 6PF, England","Mgode, GF (reprint author), Sokoine Univ Agr, Ctr Pest Management, Morogoro, Tanzania.",gfmgode@hotmail.com,"Belmain, Steven R/F-7758-2012","Belmain, Steven R/0000-0002-5590-7545; Mgode, Georgies/0000-0001-9660-8202; Mgode, Georgies/0000-0002-5618-5644","NUFFIC (The Netherlands) through NFP fellowship; Flemish Inter-university Council (VLIR) (Belgium); European Union [INCO-Dev ICA4-CT-2002-10056, EDF FED 2013-330-223]; COSTECH (Tanzania); International Foundation for Science [IFS: D-4666-2]","This research was supported by grants from NUFFIC (The Netherlands) through NFP fellowship granted to GFM, funding from the Flemish Inter-university Council (VLIR) (Belgium), the European Union (Ratzooman Project, INCO-Dev ICA4-CT-2002-10056 and StopRats Project EDF FED 2013-330-223), COSTECH (Tanzania) and the International Foundation for Science (IFS: D-4666-2).

Incentives were distributed during central-point rabies vaccination clinics in northern Tanzania to quantify their effect on owner participation. In villages where incentives were handed out participation increased, with an average of 34 more dogs being vaccinated. Through economies of scale, this represents a reduction in the cost-per-dog of $ 0.47. This represents the price-threshold under which the cost of the incentive used must fall to be economically viable. Additionally, vaccination coverage levels were determined in ten villages through the gold-standard village-wide census technique, as well as through two cheaper and quicker methods (randomized household questionnaire and the transect survey). Cost data were also collected. Both non-gold standard methods were found to be accurate when puppies were included in the calculations, although the transect survey and the household questionnaire survey over-and under-estimated the coverage respectively. Given that additional demographic data can be collected through the household questionnaire survey, and that its estimate of coverage is more conservative, we recommend this method. Despite the use of incentives the average vaccination coverage was below the 70% threshold for eliminating rabies. We discuss the reasons and suggest solutions to improve coverage. Given recent international targets to eliminate rabies, this study provides valuable and timely data to help improve mass dog vaccination programs in Africa and elsewhere.","[Minyoo, Abel B.; Gwakisa, Paul; Lankester, Felix] Nelson Mandela African Inst Sci & Technol, Sch Life Sci, Arusha, Tanzania; [Steinmetz, Melissa; Lankester, Felix] Washington State Univ, Paul G Allen Sch Global Anim Hlth, Pullman, WA 99164 USA; [Czupryna, Anna] Univ Illinois, Dept Ecol & Evolut, Lincoln Pk Zoo, Chicago, IL USA; [Bigambo, Machunde; Mzimbiri, Imam; Powell, George] Serengeti Hlth Initiat SHI, Serengeti, Tanzania; [Gwakisa, Paul] Sokoine Univ Agr, Fac Vet Med, Genome Sci Ctr, Morogoro, Tanzania; [Gwakisa, Paul] Sokoine Univ Agr, Fac Vet Med, Dept Vet Microbiol & Parasitol, Morogoro, Tanzania","Minyoo, AB (reprint author), Nelson Mandela African Inst Sci & Technol, Sch Life Sci, Arusha, Tanzania.",minyooa@nm-aist.ac.tz,,"Lankester, Felix/0000-0002-0802-0693",Commission for Science and Technology through The Nelson Mandela African Institution of Science and Technology [NM-AIST/M.067/T.12],"The Commission for Science and Technology is the funding agent through The Nelson Mandela African Institution of Science and Technology (www.nm-aist.ac.tz) with grant number NM-AIST/M.067/T.12.

The Northeastern part of India is a hot spot of infection since the climatic conditions are most conducive for the infection and so far no systemic study has been carried out in this region. Methodology/Principal Findings Following a cross-sectional study designed during the period 2011-2014, a total of 1260 fecal samples collected from the Northeast Indian population were subjected tomicroscopy, fecal culture and a sensitive and specific DNA dot blot screening assay developed in our laboratory targeting the Entamoeba spp. Further species discrimination using PCR assay performed in microscopy, culture and DNA dot blot screening positive samples showed E. histolytica an overall prevalence rate of 11.1%, 8.0% and 13.7% respectively. In addition, infection rates of nonpathogenic E. dispar and E. moshkovskii were 11.8%(95% CI = 10.2, 13.8) and 7.8% (95% CI = 6.4, 9.4) respectively. The spatial distributions of infection were 18.2%(107/588) of Assam, 11.7%(23/197) ofManipur, 10.2%(21/207) of Meghalaya, and 8.2%(22/268) of Tripura states. Association study of the disease with demographic features suggested poor living condition (OR = 3.21; 95% CI = 1.83, 5.63), previous history of infection in family member (OR = 3.18; 95% CI = 2.09, 4.82) and unhygienic toilet facility (OR = 1.79; 95% CI = 1.28, 2.49) as significant risk factors for amoebiasis. Children in age group < 15 yr, participants having lower levels of education, and daily laborers exhibited a higher infection rate. Conclusions/Significance Despite the importance of molecular diagnosis of amoebiasis, molecular epidemiological data based on a large sample size from endemic countries are rarely reported in the literature. Improved and faster method of diagnosis employed here to dissect out the pathogenic from the nonpathogenic species would help the clinicians to prescribe the appropriate anti-amoebic drug.","[Nath, Joyobrato; Singha, Baby] Gurucharan Coll, Dept Zool, Silchar, Assam, India; [Nath, Joyobrato; Ghosh, Sankar Kumar] Assam Univ, Dept Biotechnol, Silchar, Assam, India; [Paul, Jaishree] Jawaharlal Nehru Univ, Sch Life Sci, New Delhi 110067, India","Nath, J (reprint author), Gurucharan Coll, Dept Zool, Silchar, Assam, India.",jpaul33@hotmail.com,,,"Department of Biotechnology, Ministry of Science and technology, New Delhi, India [BT/55/NE/TBP/2010]","BS and JP received the joint funding from the Department of Biotechnology, Ministry of Science and technology, New Delhi, India through North East Twining program.

However, elderly populations with M. ulcerans disease have not been comprehensively studied. Methodology/Principal Findings A retrospective analysis was performed on an observational cohort of all confirmed M. ulcerans cases managed at Barwon Health from 1/1/1998-31/12/2014. The cohort included 327 patients; 131(40.0%) >= 65 years and 196(60.0%) < 65 years of age. Patients >= 65 years had a shorter median duration of symptoms prior to diagnosis (p< 0.01), a higher proportion with diabetes (p< 0.001) and immune suppression (p< 0.001), and were more likely to have lesions that were multiple (OR 4.67, 95% CI 1.78-12.31, p< 0.001) and WHO category 3 (OR 4.59, 95% CI 1.98-10.59, p< 0.001). Antibiotic complications occurred in 69(24.3%) treatment episodes at an increased incidence in those aged >= 65 years (OR 5.29, 95% CI 2.81-9.98, p< 0.001). There were 4(1.2%) deaths, with significantly more in the age-group >= 65 years (4 compared with 0 deaths, p = 0.01). The overall treatment success rate was 92.2%. For the age-group >= 65 years there was a reduced rate of treatment success overall (OR 0.34, 95% CI 0.14-0.80, p = < 0.01) and when surgery was used alone (OR 0.21, 95% CI 0.06-0.76, p< 0.01). Patients >= 65 years were more likely to have a paradoxical reaction (OR 2.06, 95% CI 1.17-3.62, p = 0.01). Conclusions/Significance Elderly patients comprise a significant proportion of M. ulcerans disease patients in Australian populations and present with more severe and advanced disease forms. Currently recommended treatments are associated with increased toxicity and reduced effectiveness in elderly populations. Increased efforts are required to diagnose M. ulcerans earlier in elderly populations, and research is urgently required to develop more effective and less toxic treatments for this age-group.","[O'Brien, Daniel P.; Friedman, N.

A better understanding of the genetic diversity of T. solium will improve parasite diagnostics and transmission pathways in endemic areas thereby facilitating the design of future control measures and interventions. Microsatellite markers are useful genome features, which enable strain typing and identification in complex pathogen genomes. Here we describe microsatellite identification and characterization in T. solium, providing information that will assist in global efforts to control this important pathogen. Methods For genome sequencing, T. solium cysts and proglottids were collected from Huancayo and Puno in Peru, respectively. Using next generation sequencing (NGS) and de novo assembly, we assembled two draft genomes and one hybrid genome. Microsatellite sequences were identified and 36 of them were selected for further analysis. Twenty T. solium isolates were collected from Tumbes in the northern region, and twenty from Puno in the southern region of Peru. The size-polymorphism of the selected microsatellites was determined with multi-capillary electrophoresis. We analyzed the association between microsatellite polymorphism and the geographic origin of the samples. Results The predicted size of the hybrid (proglottid genome combined with cyst genome) T. solium genome was 111 MB with a GC content of 42.54%. A total of 7,979 contigs (>1,000 nt) were obtained. We identified 9,129 microsatellites in the Puno-proglottid genome and 9,936 in the Huancayo-cyst genome, with 5 or more repeats, ranging from mono-to hexa-nucleotide. Seven microsatellites were polymorphic and 29 were monomorphic within the analyzed isolates. T. solium tapeworms were classified into two genetic groups that correlated with the North/South geographic origin of the parasites. Conclusions/Significance The availability of draft genomes for T. solium represents a significant step towards the understanding the biology of the parasite. We report here a set of T. solium polymorphic microsatellite markers that appear promising for genetic epidemiology studies.","[Pajuelo, Monica J.; Eguiluz, Maria; Requena, David; Guzman, Frank; Ramirez, Manuel; Sheen, Patricia; Zimic, Mirko] Univ Peruana Cayetano Heredia, Fac Ciencias & Filosofia, Lab Bioinformat & Biol Mol, Labs Invest & Desarrollo, Lima, Peru; [Dahlstrom, Eric; Anzick, Sarah; Bruno, Dan; Mahanty, Siddhartha; Nash, Theodore; Porcella, Steve] NIAID, Genom Unit, Res Technol Sect, Rocky Mt Labs,NIH, Hamilton, MT USA; [Frace, Michael; Sammons, Scott] Ctr Dis Control & Prevent, Biotechnol Core, Natl Ctr Emerging & Zoonot Infect Dis, Facil Branch, Atlanta, GA USA; [Cama, Vitaliano; Wilkins, Patricia] Ctr Dis Control & Prevent, Div Parasit Dis & Malaria, Ctr Global Hlth, Atlanta, GA USA; [Gonzalez, Armando] Univ Nacl Mayor San Marcos, Fac Med Vet, Lima 14, Peru; [Garcia, Hector H.] Univ Peruana Cayetano Heredia, Fac Ciencias & Filosofia, Dept Microbiol, Lima, Peru; [Garcia, Hector H.] Inst Nacl Ciencias Neurol, Lima, Peru; [Gilman, Robert H.] Johns Hopkins Univ, Bloomberg Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Int Hlth, Baltimore, MD USA","Pajuelo, MJ (reprint author), Univ Peruana Cayetano Heredia, Fac Ciencias & Filosofia, Lab Bioinformat & Biol Mol, Labs Invest & Desarrollo, Lima, Peru.",Mirko.zimic@upch.pe,"Guzman, Frank L/H-1271-2014","Guzman, Frank L/0000-0002-5048-4213; moyano, luz maria/0000-0002-5878-5782; Gonzalez, Armando/0000-0003-1909-1873; Eguiluz, Maria/0000-0002-5370-6176; Mahanty, Siddhartha/0000-0003-1068-0524","Fogarty International Center/NIH [D43TW006581, D43TW001140]; Wellcome Trust Senior International Research Fellowship in Public Health and Tropical Medicine","This work was partially supported by the Fogarty International Center/NIH Training Grants D43TW001140 and D43TW006581.

Most eukaryotes including free-living flatworms have numerous paralogues of the CYP gene encoding heme monooxygenases with specific substrate range. Notably, by contrast, the parasitic flatworms have only one CYP gene. The role of this enzyme in the physiology and biochemistry of helminths is not known. The flukes and tapeworms are the etiologic agents of major neglected tropical diseases of humanity. Three helminth infections (Opisthorchis viverrini, Clonorchis sinensis and Schistosoma haematobium) are considered by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) as definite causes of cancer. We focused our research on the human liver fluke Opisthorchis felineus, an emerging source of biliary tract disease including bile duct cancer in Russia and central Europe. The aims of this study were (i) to determine the significance of the CYP activity for the morphology and survival of the liver fluke, (ii) to assess CYP ability to metabolize xenobiotics, and (iii) to localize the CYP activity in O. felineus tissues. We observed high constitutive expression of CYP mRNA (Real-time PCR) in O. felineus. This enzyme metabolized xenobiotics selective for mammalian CYP2E1, CYP2B, CYP3A, but not CYP1A, as determined by liquid chromatography and imaging analyses. Tissue localization studies revealed the CYP activity in excretory channels, while suppression of CYP mRNA by RNA interference was accompanied by morphological changes of the excretory system and increased mortality rates of the worms. These results suggest that the CYP function is linked to worm metabolism and detoxification. The findings also suggest that the CYP enzyme is involved in vitally important processes in the organism of parasites and is a potential drug target.","[Pakharukova, Mariya Y.; Mordvinov, Viatcheslav A.] Russian Acad Sci, Lab Mol Mech Pathol Proc, Inst Cytol & Genet, Siberian Branch, Novosibirsk, Russia; [Pakharukova, Mariya Y.] Novosibirsk State Univ, Dept Nat Sci, Novosibirsk 630090, Russia; [Vavilin, Valentin A.; Mordvinov, Viatcheslav A.] Russian Acad Med Sci, Lab Pharmacokinet & Drugs Metab, Inst Mol Biol & Biophys, Siberian Branch, Novosibirsk, Russia; [Sripa, Banchob] Khon Kaen Univ, Trop Dis Res Lab, Liver Fluke & Cholangiocarcinoma Res Ctr, Dept Pathol,Fac Med, Khon Kaen, Thailand; [Laha, Thewarach] Khon Kaen Univ, Fac Med, Dept Parasitol, Khon Kaen 40002, Thailand; [Brindley, Paul J.] George Washington Univ, Sch Med & Hlth Sci, Dept Microbiol Immunol & Trop Med, Washington, DC 20052 USA; [Brindley, Paul J.] George Washington Univ, Sch Med & Hlth Sci, Res Ctr Neglected Dis Poverty, Washington, DC 20052 USA","Pakharukova, MY (reprint author), Russian Acad Sci, Lab Mol Mech Pathol Proc, Inst Cytol & Genet, Siberian Branch, Novosibirsk, Russia.",pmaria@yandex.ru,"Pakharukova, Mariya/R-6999-2017; Vavilin, Valentin A/K-6100-2012; Mordvinov, Viatcheslav/S-8277-2017","Pakharukova, Mariya/0000-0003-1054-2068; Mordvinov, Viatcheslav/0000-0002-6173-0774; Brindley, Paul/0000-0003-1765-0002; Vavivilin, Valentin/0000-0002-9769-6512","Russian Foundation for Basic Research [13-04-00662a, 15-54-45132 Ind_a]; Institute of Cytology and Genetics, Siberian Branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences [VI.60.1.1]; National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, US National Institutes of Health (NIH) [P50AI098639]; Pfizer's Moscow office","Financial support for this study was provided in part by the Russian Foundation for Basic Research (# 13-04-00662a, #15-54-45132 Ind_a) and by the State Project of Institute of Cytology and Genetics, Siberian Branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences (#VI.60.1.1) (MYP, VAM).

Little is known about the molecular mechanisms whereby E. granulosus is able to survive in the hostile mammalian host environment, avoiding attack by host enzymes and evading immune responses, but protease inhibitors released by the parasite are likely implicated. We identified two nucleotide sequences corresponding to secreted single domain Kunitz type protease inhibitors (EgKIs) in the E. granulosus genome, and their cDNAs were cloned, bacterially expressed and purified. EgKI-1 is highly expressed in the oncosphere (egg) stage and is a potent chymotrypsin and neutrophil elastase inhibitor that binds calcium and reduced neutrophil infiltration in a local inflammation model. EgKI-2 is highly expressed in adult worms and is a potent inhibitor of trypsin. As powerful inhibitors of mammalian intestinal proteases, the EgKIs may play a pivotal protective role in preventing proteolytic enzyme attack thereby ensuring survival of E. granulosus within its mammalian hosts. EgKI-1 may also be involved in the oncosphere in host immune evasion by inhibiting neutrophil elastase and cathepsin G once this stage is exposed to the mammalian blood system. In light of their key roles in protecting E. granulosus from host enzymatic attack, the EgKI proteins represent potential intervention targets to control CE. This is important as new public health measures against CE are required, given the inefficiencies of available drugs and the current difficulties in its treatment and control. In addition, being a small sized highly potent serine protease inhibitor, and an inhibitor of neutrophil chemotaxis, EgKI-1 may have clinical potential as a novel anti-inflammatory therapeutic.","[Ranasinghe, Shiwanthi L.; Fischer, Katja; Zhang, Wenbao; Gobert, Geoffrey N.; McManus, Donald P.] QIMR Berghofer Med Res Inst, Mol Parasitol Lab, Herston, Qld, Australia; [Ranasinghe, Shiwanthi L.] Univ Queensland, Sch Publ Hlth, Herston, Qld, Australia; [Zhang, Wenbao] Xinjiang Med Univ, Dept Biochem, Urumqi, Xinjiang, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Wenbao] Xinjiang Med Univ, Affiliated Hosp 1, Clin Med Res Inst, Urumqi, Xinjiang, Peoples R China","Ranasinghe, SL (reprint author), QIMR Berghofer Med Res Inst, Mol Parasitol Lab, Herston, Qld, Australia.",Shiwanthi.Ranasinghe@qimrberghofer.edu.au; Don.McManus@qimrberghofer.edu.au,"Gobert, Geoffrey/V-2985-2019","Ranasinghe, Shiwanthi/0000-0002-6681-8003; Gobert, Geoffrey/0000-0001-5884-6453","National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) of Australia [1037304, 613671]","This work was supported by the National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) of Australia (ID 1037304 and ID 613671).

Here, we describe the production of recombinant antigens from Trypanosoma brucei gambiense (T.b. gambiense) in the related species Leishmania tarentolae (L. tarentolae), and compare their diagnostic sensitivity and specificity to native antigens currently used in diagnostic kits against a panel of human sera. A number of T.b. gambiense protein antigen candidates were chosen for recombinant expression in L. tarentolae based on current diagnostics in field use and recent findings on immunodiagnostic antigens found by proteomic profiling. In particular, the extracellular domains of invariant surface glycoprotein 65 (ISG65), variant surface glycoproteins VSG LiTat 1.3 and VSG LiTat 1.5 were fused with C-terminal histidine tags and expressed as soluble proteins in the medium of cultured, recombinant L. tarentolae. Using affinity chromatography, on average 10 mg/L of recombinant protein was purified from cultures and subsequently tested against a panel of sera from sleeping sickness patients from controls, i.e. persons without sleeping sickness living in HAT endemic countries. The evaluation on sera from 172 T.b. gambiense human African trypanosomiasis (HAT) patients and from 119 controls showed very high diagnostic potential of the two recombinant VSG and the rISG65 fragments with areas under the curve between 0.97 and 0.98 compared to 0.98 and 0.99 with native VSG LiTat 1.3 and VSG LiTat 1.5 (statistically not different). Evaluation on sera from 78 T.b. rhodesiense HAT patients and from 100 controls showed an acceptable diagnostic potential of rISG65 with an area under the curve of 0.83. These results indicate that a combination of these recombinant antigens has the potential to be used in next generation rapid serodiagnostic tests. In addition, the L. tarentolae expression system enables simple, cheap and efficient production of recombinant kinetoplatid proteins for use in diagnostic, vaccine and drug discovery research that does not rely on animal use to generate materials.","[Rooney, Barrie; Smales, C.

Immunological evidence of exposure to Leishmania in residents of endemic areas has been the basis for defining the human population with asymptomatic infection. However, parasitological confirmation of subclinical infection is lacking. Methods We investigated the presence and viability of Leishmania in blood and non-invasive mucosal tissue samples from individuals with immunological evidence of subclinical infection in endemic areas for CL caused by Leishmania (Viannia) in Colombia. Detection of Leishmania kDNA was conducted by PCR-Southern Blot, and parasite viability was confirmed by amplification of parasite 7SLRNA gene transcripts. A molecular tool for genetic diversity analysis of parasite populations causing persistent subclinical infection based on PCR amplification and sequence analysis of an 82bp region between kDNA conserved blocks 1 and 2 was developed. Principal Findings Persistent Leishmania infection was demonstrated in 40% (46 of 114) of leishmanin skin test (LST) positive individuals without active disease; parasite viability was established in 59% of these (27 of 46; 24% of total). Parasite burden quantified from circulating blood monocytes, nasal, conjunctival or tonsil mucosal swab samples was comparable, and ranged between 0.2 to 22 parasites per reaction. kDNA sequences were obtained from samples from 2 individuals with asymptomatic infection and from 26 with history of CL, allowing genetic distance analysis that revealed diversity among sequences and clustering within the L. (Viannia) subgenus. Conclusions Our results provide parasitological confirmation of persistent infection among residents of endemic areas of L. (Viannia) transmission who have experienced asymptomatic infection or recovered from CL, revealing a reservoir of infection that potentially contributes to the endemicity and transmission of disease. kDNA genotyping establishes proof-of-principle of the feasibility of genetic diversity analysis in previously inaccessible and unexplored parasite populations in subclinically infected individuals.","[Rosales-Chilama, Mariana; Gongora, Rafael E.; Valderrama, Liliana; Jojoa, Jimena; Alexander, Neal; Rubiano, Luisa C.; Cossio, Alexandra; Saravia, Nancy G.; Adelaida Gomez, Maria] Ctr Int Entrenamiento & Invest Med CIDEM, Cali, Colombia; [Adams, Emily R.] Univ Liverpool, Liverpool Sch Trop Med, Ctr Appl Hlth Res, Liverpool L3 5QA, Merseyside, England","Rosales-Chilama, M (reprint author), Ctr Int Entrenamiento & Invest Med CIDEM, Cali, Colombia.",mgomez@cideim.org.co,,"Adams, Emily/0000-0002-0816-2835",COLCIENCIAS-CIDEIM [797-2009]; COLCIENCIAS [252-2010-code 222951928948]; Swiss National Science Foundation [1Z70Z0-131421]; Fogarty International Center / National Institutes of Health [2D43TW006589],"MRC was supported by the COLCIENCIAS-CIDEIM Young Investigator agreement number 797-2009.

BU is characterized by a wide range of clinical forms, including non-ulcerative cutaneous lesions that can evolve into severe ulcers if left untreated. Nevertheless, spontaneous healing has been reported to occur, although knowledge on this process is scarce both in naturally infected humans and experimental models of infection. Animal models are useful since they mimic different spectrums of human BU disease and have the potential to elucidate the pathogenic/protective pathway(s) involved in disease/healing. In this time-lapsed study, we characterized the guinea pig, an animal model of resistance to M. ulcerans, focusing on the macroscopic, microbiological and histological evolution throughout the entire experimental infectious process. Subcutaneous infection of guinea pigs with a virulent strain of M. ulcerans led to early localized swelling, which evolved into small well defined ulcers. These macroscopic observations correlated with the presence of necrosis, acute inflammatory infiltrate and an abundant bacterial load. By the end of the infectious process when ulcerative lesions healed, M. ulcerans viability decreased and the subcutaneous tissue organization returned to its normal state after a process of continuous healing characterized by tissue granulation and reepethelialization. In conclusion, we show that the experimental M. ulcerans infection of the guinea pig mimics the process of spontaneous healing described in BU patients, displaying the potential to uncover correlates of protection against BU, which can ultimately contribute to the development of new prophylactic and therapeutic strategies.","[Silva-Gomes, Rita; Marcq, Elly; Trigo, Gabriela; Goncalves, Carine M.; Longatto-Filho, Adhemar; Castro, Antonio G.; Pedrosa, Jorge; Fraga, Alexandra G.] Univ Minho, Sch Hlth Sci, Life & Hlth Sci Res Inst ICVS, Braga, Portugal; [Silva-Gomes, Rita; Marcq, Elly; Trigo, Gabriela; Goncalves, Carine M.; Longatto-Filho, Adhemar; Castro, Antonio G.; Pedrosa, Jorge; Fraga, Alexandra G.] ICVS 3Bs PT Govt Associate Lab, Braga, Portugal; [Marcq, Elly] Inst Trop Med, Dept Biomed Sci, Mycobacteriol Unit, B-2000 Antwerp, Belgium; [Trigo, Gabriela] Univ Minho, Ctr Biol Engn, Inst Biotechnol & Bioengn, Braga, Portugal; [Longatto-Filho, Adhemar] Univ Sao Paulo, Fac Med, Lab Med Invest LIM14, Sao Paulo, Brazil; [Longatto-Filho, Adhemar] Barretos Canc Hosp, Mol Oncol Res Ctr, Barretos, Brazil","Silva-Gomes, R (reprint author), Univ Minho, Sch Hlth Sci, Life & Hlth Sci Res Inst ICVS, Braga, Portugal.",jpedrosa@ecsaude.uminho.pt,"longatto-filho, adhemar/D-7039-2013; Castro, Gil/T-7584-2018; Pedrosa, Jorge/H-4877-2011; Fraga, Alexandra/T-5174-2018; Longatto-Filho, Adhemar/N-3397-2019","longatto-filho, adhemar/0000-0002-5779-9752; Castro, Gil/0000-0002-4684-4183; Pedrosa, Jorge/0000-0002-8204-4888; Fraga, Alexandra/0000-0003-2029-1629; Longatto-Filho, Adhemar/0000-0002-5779-9752; Marcq, Elly/0000-0003-3173-0500; Branquinho, Gabriela/0000-0002-6826-8543; Goncalves, Carine/0000-0002-4512-6147","European Community [241500]; Health Services of the Fundacao Calouste Gulbenkian [94776]; Fundacao para a Ciencia e Tecnologia (FCT); Programa Operacional Regional do Norte (ON.2-O Novo Norte); Quadro de Referencia Estrategico Nacional (QREN) through the Fundo Europeu de Desenvolvimento Regional (FEDER); Projeto Estrategico - LA 26 [PEst-C/SAU/LA0026/2013]; FCT fellowship [SFRH/BPD/68547/2010, SFRH/BPD/64032/2009]; QREN fellowship [UMINHO/BPD/40/2013]; Life Long Learning Erasmus program","The research leading to these results has received funding from the European Community's Seventh Framework Program (FP7/2007-2013) under grant agreement No 241500 (BuruliVac).

Diagnosis and monitoring of infection dynamics and efficacy of treatment depend almost entirely on methods that are inaccurate, laborintensive, and unreliable. These shortcomings are amplified and take on added significance in mass drug administration programs, where measures of effectiveness depend on accurate monitoring of treatment success (or failure), changes in disease transmission rates, and emergence of possible drug resistance. Here, we adapt isothermal molecular assays such as loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) to a simple, hand-held, custommade field-ready microfluidic device that allows sensitive and specific detection of schistosome cell-free nucleic acids in serum and plasma (separated with a point-of-care plasma separator) from Schistosoma mansoni-infected mice. Cell-free S. mansoni DNA was detected with our device without prior extraction from blood. Our chip exhibits high sensitivity (similar to 2x10(-17) g/mu L), with a positive signal for S. mansoni DNA detectable as early as one week post infection, several weeks before parasite egg production commences. These results indicate that incorporation of isothermal amplification strategies with our chips could represent a strategy for rapid, simple, low-cost diagnosis of both pre-patent and chronic schistosome infections as well as potential monitoring of treatment efficacy.","[Song, Jinzhao; Liu, Changchun; Mauk, Michael G.; Bau, Haim H.] Univ Penn, Sch Engn & Appl Sci, Dept Mech Engn & Appl Mech, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Bais, Swarna; Greenberg, Robert M.] Univ Penn, Sch Vet Med, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA","Song, JZ (reprint author), Univ Penn, Sch Engn & Appl Sci, Dept Mech Engn & Appl Mech, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.",rgree@vet.upenn.edu,"Song, Jinzhao/Q-7866-2016; Bau, Haim H/D-1161-2009",,"National Institutes of Health [R21AI112713, K25AI099160]","This work was supported by grants R21AI112713 (RMG) and K25AI099160 (CL) from the National Institutes of Health (www.nih.gov).

In tropical countries such as India where periodic dengue outbreaks can be correlated to the high prevalence of the mosquito vector, circulation of all four dengue viruses (DENVs) and the high population density, a drug for dengue is being increasingly recognized as an unmet public health need. Methodology/Principal findings Using the knowledge of traditional Indian medicine, Ayurveda, we developed a systematic bioassay-guided screening approach to explore the indigenous herbal bio-resource to identify plants with pan-DENV inhibitory activity. Our results show that the alcoholic extract of Cissampelos pariera Linn (Cipa extract) was a potent inhibitor of all four DENVs in cell-based assays, assessed in terms of viral NS1 antigen secretion using ELISA, as well as viral replication, based on plaque assays. Virus yield reduction assays showed that Cipa extract could decrease viral titers by an order of magnitude. The extract conferred statistically significant protection against DENV infection using the AG129 mouse model. A preliminary evaluation of the clinical relevance of Cipa extract showed that it had no adverse effects on platelet counts and RBC viability. In addition to inherent antipyretic activity in Wistar rats, it possessed the ability to down-regulate the production of TNF-alpha, a cytokine implicated in severe dengue disease. Importantly, it showed no evidence of toxicity in Wistar rats, when administered at doses as high as 2g/Kg body weight for up to 1 week. Conclusions/Significance Our findings above, taken in the context of the human safety of Cipa, based on its use in Indian traditional medicine, warrant further work to explore Cipa as a source for the development of an inexpensive herbal formulation for dengue therapy. This may be of practical relevance to a dengue-endemic resource-poor country such as India.","[Sood, Ruchi; Pareek, Pawan Kumar; Barman, Tarani Kanta; Singhal, Smita; Sharma, Navin; Kanaujia, Anil; Shukla, Gyanesh; Katiyar, Chandra K.; Bhatnagar, Pradip K.; Upadhyay, Dilip J.] Ranbaxy Res Labs, New Drug Discovery Res, Dept Microbiol, Gurgaon, Haryana, India; [Raut, Rajendra; Tyagi, Poornima; Swaminathan, Sathyamangalam; Khanna, Navin] Recombinant Gene Prod Grp, Int Ctr Genet Engn & Biotechnol, New Delhi, India; [Shirumalla, Raj Kumar; Kanoje, Vijay; Subbarayan, Ramesh; Rajerethinam, Ravisankar] Ranbaxy Res Labs, New Drug Discovery Res, Dept Pharmacol, Gurgaon, Haryana, India; [Gupta, Y.

Despite previous evidence of spatial clustering in cysticercosis and the role of environmental factors (e. g. temperature and humidity) in the survival of eggs, little research has explored these aspects of Taenia spp. epidemiology. In addition, there are significant gaps in our understanding of risk factors for infection in humans and pigs. This study aimed to assess the influence of socio-economic, behavioural and environmental variables on human and porcine cysticercosis. A cross-sectional survey for human taeniasis (T. solium and T. saginata), human cysticercosis (T. solium) and pig cysticercosis (T. solium) in 416 households in western Kenya was carried out. These data were linked to questionnaire responses and environmental datasets. Multi-level regression was used to examine the relationships between covariates and human and porcine cysticercosis. The HP10 Ag-ELISA sero-prevalence (suggestive of cysticercosis) was 6.6% for humans (95% CI 5.6%-7.7%), and 17.2% for pigs (95% CI 10.2%-26.4%). Human taeniasis prevalence, based on direct microscopic observation of Taenia spp. eggs (i. e. via microscopy results only) was 0.2% (95% CI 0.05%-0.5%). Presence of Taenia spp. antigen in both humans and pigs was significantly associated with a range of factors, including positive correlations with land cover. The presence of HP10 antigen in humans was correlated (non-linearly) with the proportion of land within a 1 km buffer that was flooding agricultural land and grassland (odds ratio [OR] = 1.09 and 0.998; p = 0.03 and 0.03 for the linear and quadratic terms respectively), gender (OR = 0.58 for males compared to females, p = 0.02), level of education (OR = 0.62 for primary level education versus no formal education, p = 0.09), use of well water for drinking (OR = 2.76 for those who use well water versus those who do not, p = 0.02) and precipitation (OR = 0.998, p = 0.02). Presence of Taenia spp. antigen in pigs was significantly correlated with gender and breeding status of the pig (OR = 10.35 for breeding sows compared to boars, p = 0.01), and the proportion of land within a 1 km buffer that was flooding agricultural land and grassland (OR = 1.04, p = 0.004). These results highlight the role of multiple socio-economic, behavioural and environmental factors in Taenia spp. transmission patterns. Environmental contamination with Taenia spp. eggs is a key issue, with landscape factors influencing presence of Taenia spp. antigens in both pigs and humans.","[Wardrop, Nicola A.] Univ Southampton, Geog & Environm, Southampton, Hants, England; [Thomas, Lian F.; de Glanville, William A.; Cook, Elizabeth A.

The control and eventual elimination of P. vivax are global health priorities. Genomic research contributes to this objective by improving our understanding of the biology of P. vivax and through the development of new genetic markers that can be used to monitor efforts to reduce malaria transmission. Here we analyze whole-genome data from eight field samples from a region in Cordoba, Colombia where malaria is endemic. We find considerable genetic diversity within this population, a result that contrasts with earlier studies suggesting that P. vivax had limited diversity in the Americas. We also identify a selective sweep around a substitution known to confer resistance to sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP). This is the first observation of a selective sweep for SP resistance in this species. These results indicate that P. vivax has been exposed to SP pressure even when the drug is not in use as a first line treatment for patients afflicted by this parasite. We identify multiple non-synonymous substitutions in three other genes known to be involved with drug resistance in Plasmodium species. Finally, we found extensive microsatellite polymorphisms. Using this information we developed 18 polymorphic and easy to score microsatellite loci that can be used in epidemiological investigations in South America.","[Winter, David J.; Pacheco, M.

Because of toxicity and limited spectrum of activity of alternatives, there is effectively only one drug, praziquantel, available for its treatment. Recent data suggest that drug resistance could soon be a problem. There is therefore the need to identify new drug targets and develop drugs for the treatment of schistosomiasis. Analysis of the Schistosoma mansoni genome sequence for proteins involved in detoxification processes found that it encodes a single cytochrome P450 (CYP450) gene. Here we report that the 1452 bp open reading frame has a characteristic heme-binding region in its catalytic domain with a conserved heme ligating cysteine, a hydrophobic leader sequence present as the membrane interacting region, and overall structural conservation. The highest sequence identity to human CYP450s is 22%. Double stranded RNA (dsRNA) silencing of S. mansoni (Sm)CYP450 in schistosomula results in worm death. Treating larval or adult worms with antifungal azole CYP450 inhibitors results in worm death at low micromolar concentrations. In addition, combinations of SmCYP450-specific dsRNA and miconazole show additive schistosomicidal effects supporting the hypothesis that SmCYP450 is the target of miconazole. Treatment of developing S. mansoni eggs with miconazole results in a dose dependent arrest in embryonic development. Our results indicate that SmCYP450 is essential for worm survival and egg development and validates it as a novel drug target. Preliminary structure-activity relationship suggests that the 1-(2,4-dichlorophenyl)-2-(1H-imidazol-1-yl)ethan-1-ol moiety of miconazole is necessary for activity and that miconazole activity and selectivity could be improved by rational drug design.","[Ziniel, Peter D.; Barnard, Andrew H.; Fisher, Ethan M.

The disease is caused by infection with CCHF virus (CCHFV), a nairovirus from the Bunyaviridae family. Basic research on CCHFV has been severely hampered by biosafety requirements and lack of available strains and molecular tools. We report the development of a CCHF transcription-and entry-competent virus-like particle (tecVLP) system that can be used to study cell entry and viral transcription/replication over a broad dynamic range (similar to 4 orders of magnitude). The tecVLPs are morphologically similar to authentic CCHFV. Incubation of immortalized and primary human cells with tecVLPs results in a strong reporter signal that is sensitive to treatment with neutralizing monoclonal antibodies and by small molecule inhibitors of CCHFV. We used glycoproteins and minigenomes from divergent CCHFV strains to generate tecVLPs, and in doing so, we identified a monoclonal antibody that can prevent cell entry of tecVLPs containing glycoproteins from 3 pathogenic CCHFV strains. In addition, our data suggest that different glycoprotein moieties confer different cellular entry efficiencies, and that glycoproteins from the commonly used strain IbAr10200 have up to 100-fold lower ability to enter primary human cells compared to glycoproteins from pathogenic CCHFV strains.","[Zivcec, Marko; Albarino, Cesar G.; Guerrero, Lisa W.; Spiropoulou, Christina F.; Bergeron, Eric] Ctr Dis Control & Prevent, Viral Special Pathogens Branch, Natl Ctr Emerging & Zoonot Infect Dis, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA; [Metcalfe, Maureen G.] Ctr Dis Control & Prevent, Infect Dis Pathol Branch, Div High Consequence Pathogens & Pathol, Natl Ctr Emerging & Zoonot Infect Dis, Atlanta, GA USA; [Pegan, Scott D.] Univ Georgia, Dept Pharmaceut & Biomed Sci, Athens, GA 30602 USA","Zivcec, M (reprint author), Ctr Dis Control & Prevent, Viral Special Pathogens Branch, Natl Ctr Emerging & Zoonot Infect Dis, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA.",ebergeron@cdc.gov,"Bergeron, Eric/N-9566-2019","Bergeron, Eric/0000-0003-3398-8628; Zivcec, Marko/0000-0003-4337-8487",National Institute of Health [R01AI109008],"This work was funded in part through National Institute of Health grant R01AI109008.

While direct fecal-oral transmission is thought to be the predominant mode of transmission, recent evidence suggests that indirect environmental transmission may also contribute to disease spread. Methods Data from a population-based infectious disease surveillance system (28,000 individuals followed biweekly) were used to map the spatial pattern of typhoid fever in Kibera, an urban informal settlement in Nairobi Kenya, between 2010-2011. Spatial modeling was used to test whether variations in topography and accumulation of surface water explain the geographic patterns of risk. Results Among children less than ten years of age, risk of typhoid fever was geographically heterogeneous across the study area (p = 0.016) and was positively associated with lower elevation, OR = 1.87, 95% CI (1.36-2.57), p < 0.001. In contrast, the risk of typhoid fever did not vary geographically or with elevation among individuals less than 6b ten years of age. Conclusions Our results provide evidence of indirect, environmental transmission of typhoid fever among children, a group with high exposure to fecal pathogens in the environment. Spatially targeting sanitation interventions may decrease enteric fever transmission.","[Akullian, Adam; Matheson, Alastair I.] Univ Washington, Sch Publ Hlth & Community Med, Dept Epidemiol, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Ng'eno, Eric; Bigogo, Godfrey; Mugoh, Maina] Kenya Govt Med Res Ctr, Ctr Global Hlth Res KEMRI CGHR, Nairobi, Kenya; [Cosmas, Leonard; Macharia, Daniel; Fields, Barry; Montgomery, Joel M.] Ctr Dis Control & Prevent, Ctr Global Hlth, Div Global Hlth Protect, Nairobi, Kenya; [John-Stewart, Grace; Walson, Judd L.] Univ Washington, Dept Global Hlth, Dept Med, Dept Pediat, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [John-Stewart, Grace; Walson, Judd L.] Univ Washington, Dept Epidemiol, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Wakefield, Jonathan] Univ Washington, Dept Stat & Biostat, Seattle, WA 98195 USA","Akullian, A (reprint author), Univ Washington, Sch Publ Hlth & Community Med, Dept Epidemiol, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.",akullian@u.washington.edu,"Bigogo, Godfrey/W-3591-2019; Walson, Judd/R-7269-2019","Walson, Judd/0000-0003-4836-720X; Ng'eno, Eric/0000-0002-0977-1579; John-Stewart, Grace/0000-0002-4301-1573",US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) "Active population-based study of major infectious disease syndromes in Kenya" [4566]; NIH U19 "Molecular Basis for Nontyphoidal Salmonella emergence" [AI090882]; National Science Foundation [DGE-0718124]; NIH K24 Grant: "Pediatric HIV-1 in Africa: Pathogenesis and Management" [HD054314-06],"This material is based upon work supported by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) ""Active population-based study of major infectious disease syndromes in Kenya"" (Grant No. 4566), the NIH U19 ""Molecular Basis for Nontyphoidal Salmonella emergence"" (Grant No. AI090882), the National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship Program (Grant No. DGE-0718124), and the NIH K24 Grant: ""Pediatric HIV-1 in Africa: Pathogenesis and Management"" (Grant.

Schistosoma mansoni is the most widespread species responsible for schistosomiasis in the Americas, Middle East and Africa. Adult female worms (mated to males) release eggs in the hepatic portal vasculature and are the principal cause of morbidity. Comparative separate transcriptomes of female and male adult worms were previously assessed with using microarrays and Serial Analysis of Gene Expression (SAGE), thus limiting the possibility of finding novel genes. Moreover, the egg transcriptome was analyzed only once with limited bacterially cloned cDNA libraries. Methodology/Principal findings To compare the gene expression of S. mansoni eggs, females, and males, we performed RNA-Seq on these three parasite forms using 454/Roche technology and reconstructed the transcriptome using Trinity de novo assembly. The resulting contigs were mapped to the genome and were cross-referenced with predicted Smp genes and H3K4me3 ChIP-Seq public data. For the first time, we obtained separate, unbiased gene expression profiles for S. mansoni eggs and female and male adult worms, identifying enriched biological processes and specific enriched functions for each of the three parasite forms. Transcripts with no match to predicted genes were analyzed for their protein-coding potential and the presence of an encoded conserved protein domain. A set of 232 novel protein-coding genes with putative functions related to reproduction, metabolism, and cell biogenesis was detected, which contributes to the understanding of parasite biology. Conclusions/Significance Large-scale RNA-Seq analysis using de novo assembly associated with genome-wide information for histone marks in the vicinity of gene models constitutes a new approach to transcriptome analysis that has not yet been explored in schistosomes. Importantly, all data have been consolidated into a UCSC Genome Browser search-and download-tool (http://schistosoma.usp.br/). This database provides new ways to explore the schistosome genome and transcriptome and will facilitate molecular research on this important parasite.","[Anderson, Leticia; Amaral, Murilo S.; Beckedorff, Felipe; Silva, Lucas F.; Dazzani, Bianca; Almeida, Giulliana T.; Gomes, Monete R.; Pires, David S.; Setubal, Joao C.; Verjovski-Almeida, Sergio] Univ Sao Paulo, Inst Quim, Dept Bioquim, BR-01498 Sao Paulo, Brazil; [Amaral, Murilo S.; Pires, David S.; Verjovski-Almeida, Sergio] Inst Butantan, Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil; [Oliveira, Katia C.] Adolfo Lutz Inst, Ctr Parasitol & Micol, Nucl Enteroparasitas, Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil; [Setubal, Joao C.] Virginia Polytech Inst & State Univ, Virginia Bioinformat Inst, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA; [DeMarco, Ricardo] Univ Sao Paulo, Inst Fis Sao Carlos, Sao Carlos, SP, Brazil","Anderson, L (reprint author), Univ Sao Paulo, Inst Quim, Dept Bioquim, BR-01498 Sao Paulo, Brazil.",verjo@iq.usp.br,"Amaral, Murilo/G-5769-2013; Verjovski-Almeida, Sergio/E-4082-2012; Anderson, Leticia/Q-6935-2016; Pires, David/U-8230-2018; Beckedorff, Felipe/E-6288-2012; Setubal, Joao C/C-7305-2012; DeMarco, Ricardo/A-7773-2008","Verjovski-Almeida, Sergio/0000-0002-6356-2401; Pires, David/0000-0002-4662-6469; Beckedorff, Felipe/0000-0001-6735-6851; Setubal, Joao C/0000-0001-9174-2816; DeMarco, Ricardo/0000-0001-8944-1301; Anderson, Leticia/0000-0003-3884-2329","Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo (FAPESP) [2010/51687-8]; European Union's Seventh Framework Programme [602080]; FAPESP; Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPq), Brasil","This work was supported by a grant from Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo (FAPESP grant number 2010/51687-8) to SVA and in part by a grant from the European Union's Seventh Framework Programme under grant agreement no. 602080.

The traditional paradigm establishes that transmission starts around cases, but there are few studies that determine the risk. Methods To assess the association between the peridomestic dengue infection and the exposure to a dengue index case (IC), a cohort was carried out in two Mexican endemic communities. People cohabitating with IC or living within a 50-meter radius (exposed cohort) and subjects of areas with no ICs in a 200-meter radius (unexposed cohort) were included. Results Exposure was associated with DENV infection in cohabitants (PRa 3.55; 95% CI 2.37-5.31) or neighbors (PRa 1.82; 95% CI 1.29-2.58). Age, location, toilets with no direct water discharge, families with children younger than 5 and the House Index, were associated with infection. Families with older than 13 were associated with a decreased frequency. After a month since the IC fever onset, the infection incidence was not influenced by exposure to an IC or vector density; it was influenced by the local seasonal behavior of dengue and the age. Additionally, we found asymptomatic infections accounted for 60% and a greater age was a protective factor for the presence of symptoms (RR 0.98; 95% CI 0.97-0.99). Conclusion The evidence suggests that dengue endemic transmission in these locations is initially peridomestic, around an infected subject who may be asymptomatic due to demographic structure and endemicity, and it is influenced by other characteristics of the individual, the neighborhood and the location. Once the transmission chain has been established, dengue spreads in the community probably by the adults who, despite being the group with lower infection frequency, mostly suffer asymptomatic infections and have higher mobility. This scenario complicates the opportunity and the effectiveness of control programs and highlights the need to apply multiple measures for dengue control.","[Arali Martinez-Vega, Ruth] Univ Santander, Escuela Med, Santander, Colombia; [Arali Martinez-Vega, Ruth; Ramos-Castaneda, Jose] Inst Nacl Salud Publ, Ctr Invest Enfermedades Infecciosas, Cuernavaca, Morelos, Mexico; [Arali Martinez-Vega, Ruth] Org Latinoamer El Fomento Invest Salud, Santander, Colombia; [Danis-Lozano, Rogelio] Inst Nacl Salud Publ, Dept Control Vectores, Tapachula, Chiapas, Mexico; [Diaz-Quijano, Fredi Alexander] Univ Sao Paulo, Dept Epidemiol, Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil; [Velasco-Hernandez, Jorge] Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico Juriquilla, Santiago De Queretaro, Queretaro, Mexico; [Santos-Luna, Rene; Roman-Perez, Susana] Inst Nacl Salud Publ, Subdirecc Geog Med & Sistemas, Cuernavaca, Morelos, Mexico; [Kuri-Morales, Pablo] Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Fac Med, Mexico City 04510, DF, Mexico; [Ramos-Castaneda, Jose] Univ Texas Med Branch, Ctr Trop Dis, Galveston, TX 77555 USA","Martinez-Vega, RA (reprint author), Univ Santander, Escuela Med, Santander, Colombia.",jramos@insp.mx,"Ramos-Castaneda, jose/V-6678-2019; Velasco-Hernandez, Jorge/A-5391-2008; Diaz-Quijano, Fredi Alexander/I-3740-2012","Velasco-Hernandez, Jorge/0000-0002-5604-7719; Diaz-Quijano, Fredi Alexander/0000-0002-1134-1930; Martinez-Vega, Ruth/0000-0002-6477-334X",Pfizer Scientific Institute; National Committee of Science and Technology (CONACyT) [138511]; CONACyT,"This work was supported by the Pfizer Scientific Institute (award on the Epidemiologic category of the 2010 research fund) and by the National Committee of Science and Technology (CONACyT, for its abbreviation in Spanish - Sectorial Fund of Health Research and Social Security of 138511).

Over-the-counter sales have been used for epidemiologic surveillance in the past, but rarely, if ever, in low-income countries. With few early indicators for cholera outbreaks in endemic areas, diarrhea-related product sales may serve as a useful surveillance tool. Methodology/Principal Findings We tracked daily ORS sales at 50 pharmacies and drug-sellers in an urban Bangladesh community of 129,000 for 6-months while simultaneously conducting surveillance for diarrhea hospitalizations among residents. We developed a mobile phone based system to track the sales of ORS and deployed it in parallel with a paper-based system. Our objectives were to determine if the mobile phone system was practical and acceptable to pharmacists and drug sellers, whether data were reported accurately compared to a paper-based system, and whether ORS sales were associated with future incidence of cholera hospitalizations within the community. We recorded 47,215 customers purchasing ORS, and 315 hospitalized diarrhea cases, 22% of which had culture-confirmed cholera. ORS sales and diarrhea incidence were independently associated with the mean daily temperature; therefore both unadjusted and adjusted models were explored. Through unadjusted cross-correlation statistics and generalized linear models, we found increases in ORS sales were significantly associated with increases in hospitalized diarrhea cases up to 9-days later and hospitalized cholera cases up to one day later. After adjusting for mean daily temperature, ORS was significantly associated with hospitalized diarrhea two days later and hospitalized cholera one day later. Conclusions/Significance Pharmacy sales data may serve as a feasible and useful surveillance tool. Given the relatively short lagged correlation between ORS sales and diarrhea, rapid and accurate sales data are key. More work is needed in creating actionable algorithms that make use of this data and in understanding the generalizability of our findings to other settings.","[Azman, Andrew S.; Lessler, Justin] Johns Hopkins Bloomberg Sch Publ Hlth, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA; [Satter, Syed Moinuddin; Khan, Azharul; Ahmed, Dilruba; Gurley, Emily S.] Int Ctr Diarrhoeal Dis Res, Dhaka 1000, Bangladesh; [Mckay, Michael V.] RTI Int, Nairobi, Kenya","Azman, AS (reprint author), Johns Hopkins Bloomberg Sch Publ Hlth, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA.",justin@jhu.edu,"Gurley, Emily S/B-7903-2010","Gurley, Emily S/0000-0002-8648-9403; Lessler, Justin/0000-0002-9741-8109; Ahmed, Dilruba/0000-0001-8961-2406; Azman, Andrew/0000-0001-8662-9077","Johns Hopkins Center for Global Health; Research and Policy for Infectious Disease Dynamics (RAPIDD) program of the Science and Technology Directory, Department of Homeland Security, and Fogarty International Center, National Institutes of Health","This study was funded by a Pilot Grant from the Johns Hopkins Center for Global Health (to JL) and by the Research and Policy for Infectious Disease Dynamics (RAPIDD) program of the Science and Technology Directory, Department of Homeland Security, and Fogarty International Center, National Institutes of Health (to ESG). icddr,b is thankful to the Governments of Australia, Bangladesh, Canada, Sweden and the UK for providing core/unrestricted support.

Analysing bibliometric data from published research is a powerful method for revealing research efforts, partnerships and expertise. We aim to identify and map NTD research networks in Germany and their partners abroad to enable an informed and transparent evaluation of German contributions to NTD research. Methodology/Principal Findings A SCOPUS database search for articles with German author affiliations that were published between 2002 and 2012 was conducted for kinetoplastid and helminth diseases. Openaccess tools were used for data cleaning and scientometrics (OpenRefine), geocoding (OpenStreetMaps) and to create (Table2Net), visualise and analyse co-authorship networks (Gephi). From 26,833 publications from around the world that addressed 11 diseases, we identified 1,187 (4.4%) with at least one German author affiliation, and we processed 972 publications for the five most published-about diseases. Of those, we extracted 4,007 individual authors and 863 research institutions to construct co-author networks. The majority of co-authors outside Germany were from high-income countries and Brazil. Collaborations with partners on the African continent remain scattered. NTD research within Germany was distributed among 220 research institutions. We identified strong performers on an individual level by using classic parameters (number of publications, h-index) and social network analysis parameters (betweenness centrality). The research network characteristics varied strongly between diseases. Conclusions/Significance The share of NTD publications with German affiliations is approximately half of its share in other fields of medical research. This finding underlines the need to identify barriers and expand Germany's otherwise strong research activities towards NTDs. A geospatial analysis of research collaborations with partners abroad can support decisions to strengthen research capacity, particularly in low- and middle-income countries, which were less involved in collaborations than high-income countries. Identifying knowledge hubs within individual researcher networks complements traditional scientometric indicators that are used to identify opportunities for collaboration. Using free tools to analyse research processes and output could facilitate data-driven health policies. Our findings contribute to the prioritisation of efforts in German NTD research at a time of impending local and global policy decisions.","[Bender, Max Ernst; Keil, Thomas; Tinnemann, Peter] Charite, Inst Social Med Epidemiol & Hlth Econ, D-13353 Berlin, Germany; [Bender, Max Ernst; von Philipsborn, Peter; Steinbeis, Fridolin] Univ Allied Essential Med Europe eV UAEM, Berlin, Germany; [Edwards, Suzanne] Berlin Univ Technol, Dept Hlth Care Management, Berlin, Germany; [von Philipsborn, Peter] Tech Univ Munich, Fac Med, D-80290 Munich, Germany; [Steinbeis, Fridolin] Charite, Fac Med, D-13353 Berlin, Germany","Bender, ME (reprint author), Charite, Inst Social Med Epidemiol & Hlth Econ, D-13353 Berlin, Germany.",Max.Bender@gmail.com,,"von Philipsborn, Peter/0000-0001-7059-6944",,,,44,22,23,0,30,PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE,SAN FRANCISCO,"1160 BATTERY STREET, STE 100, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94111 USA",1935-2735,,,PLOS NEGLECT TROP D,Plos Neglect.

We measured STH prevalence in rural Bangladesh and assessed potential interactions among deworming, hygienic latrines, and household finished floors. Methodology We conducted a cross-sectional survey (n = 1,630) in 100 villages in rural Bangladesh to measure three exposures: self-reported deworming consumption in the past 6 months, access to a hygienic latrine, and household flooring material. We collected stool samples from children 1-4 years, 5-12 years, and women 15-49 years. We performed mini-FLOTAC on preserved stool samples to detect Ascaris lumbricoides, Enterobius vermicularis, hookworm, and Trichuris trichiura ova. Approximately one-third (32%) of all individuals and 40% of school-aged children had an STH infection. Less than 2% of the sample had moderate/heavy intensity infections. Deworming was associated with lower Ascaris prevalence (adjusted prevalence ratio (PR) = 0.53; 95% CI 0.40, 0.71), but there was no significant association with hookworm (PR = 0.93, 95% CI 0.60, 1.44) or Trichuris (PR = 0.90, 95% CI 0.74, 1.08). PRs for hygienic latrine access were 0.91 (95% CI 0.67,1.24), 0.73 (95% CI 0.43,1.24), and 1.03 (95% CI 0.84,1.27) for Ascaris, hookworm, and Trichuris, respectively. Finished floors were associated with lower Ascaris prevalence (PR = 0.56, 95% CI 0.32, 0.97) but not associated with hookworm (PR = 0.48 95% CI 0.16,1.45) or Trichuris (PR = 0.98, 95% CI 0.72,1.33). Across helminths and combinations of exposures, adjusted prevalence ratios for joint exposures were consistently more protective than those for individual exposures. Conclusions We found moderate STH prevalence in rural Bangladesh among children and women of childbearing age. This study is one of the first to examine independent and combined associations with deworming, sanitation, and hygiene. Our results suggest that coupling deworming with sanitation and flooring interventions may yield more sustained reductions in STH prevalence.","[Benjamin-Chung, Jade; Arnold, Benjamin F.; Hubbard, Alan E.; Colford, John M., Jr.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Sch Publ Hlth, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Nazneen, Arifa; Halder, Amal K.; Haque, Rashidul; Siddique, Abdullah; Uddin, Muhammed Salah; Unicomb, Leanne] Int Ctr Diarrhoeal Dis Res, Ctr Communicable Dis, Dhaka 1000, Bangladesh; [Koporc, Kim; Addiss, David G.] Task Force Global Hlth, Children Worms, Atlanta, GA USA; [Luby, Stephen P.] Stanford Univ, Dept Med, Stanford, CA 94305 USA","Benjamin-Chung, J (reprint author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Sch Publ Hlth, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",jadebc@berkeley.edu,,"Luby, Stephen/0000-0001-5385-899X; Arnold, Benjamin/0000-0001-6105-7295",University of California Global Health Institute; UNICEF; Berkeley Research Impact Initative (BRII) - UC Berkeley Library,"Funds from the University of California Global Health Institute supported this study.

In acknowledgment of the successful history of vector control programs based on community participation across Latin America, we used a citizen science approach to gain novel insight into the geographic distribution, seasonal activity, and Trypanosoma cruzi infection prevalence of kissing bugs in Texas while empowering the public with information about Chagas disease. Methodology/Principal Findings We accepted submissions of kissing bugs encountered by the public in Texas and other states from 2013-2014 while providing educational literature about Chagas disease. In the laboratory, kissing bugs were identified to species, dissected, and tested for T. cruzi infection. A total of 1,980 triatomines were submitted to the program comprised of at least seven species, of which T. gerstaeckeri and T. sanguisuga were the most abundant (85.7% of submissions). Triatomines were most commonly collected from dog kennels and outdoor patios; Overall, 10.5% of triatomines were collected from inside the home. Triatomines were submitted from across Texas, including many counties which were not previously known to harbor kissing bugs. Kissing bugs were captured primarily throughout April-October, and peak activity occurred in June-July. Emails to our dedicated account regarding kissing bugs were more frequent in the summer months (June-August) than the rest of the year. We detected T. cruzi in 63.3% of tested bugs. Conclusions/Significance Citizen science is an efficient approach for generating data on the distribution, phenology, and infection prevalence of kissing bugs-vectors of the Chagas disease parasite-while educating the public and medical community.","[Curtis-Robles, Rachel; Auckland, Lisa D.; Hamer, Sarah A.] Texas A&M Univ, Dept Vet Integrat Biosci, College Stn, TX 77843 USA; [Wozniak, Edward J.] Texas Dept State Hlth Serv, Uvalde, TX USA; [Wozniak, Edward J.] Texas State Guard Med Brigade, Uvalde, TX USA; [Hamer, Gabriel L.] Texas A&M Univ, Dept Entomol, College Stn, TX 77843 USA","Curtis-Robles, R (reprint author), Texas A&M Univ, Dept Vet Integrat Biosci, College Stn, TX 77843 USA.",shamer@cvm.tamu.edu,,,National Science Foundation [1252521]; Texas A&M University College of Veterinary Medicine; Texas EcoLab Program; Texas AgriLife/Texas Veterinary Medical Diagnostic Lab Seed Grant; TAMU One Health Grand Challenge; TAMU-CONACYT Collaborative Research Program; Texas A&M University Online Access to Knowledge (OAK) Fund; University Libraries; Office of the Vice President for Research,"This work was supported by the National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship Program Grant No. 1252521 (RCR); Texas A&M University College of Veterinary Medicine Merit Fellow Program and Graduate Student Research Grant (RCR); Texas EcoLab Program (GLH, RCR); Texas AgriLife/Texas Veterinary Medical Diagnostic Lab Seed Grant (SAH), the TAMU One Health Grand Challenge, and the TAMU-CONACYT Collaborative Research Program (SAH).

Although disparities between affected countries have been appreciated, disparities within West African countries have not been investigated as drivers of Ebola transmission. To quantify the role that poverty plays in the transmission of Ebola, we analyzed heterogeneity of Ebola incidence and transmission factors among over 300 communities, categorized by socioeconomic status (SES), within Montserrado County, Liberia. Methodology/Principal Findings We evaluated 4,437 Ebola cases reported between February 28, 2014 and December 1, 2014 for Montserrado County to determine SES-stratified temporal trends and drivers of Ebola transmission. A dataset including dates of symptom onset, hospitalization, and death, and specified community of residence was used to stratify cases into high, middle and low SES. Additionally, information about 9,129 contacts was provided for a subset of 1,585 traced individuals. To evaluate transmission within and across socioeconomic subpopulations, as well as over the trajectory of the outbreak, we analyzed these data with a time-dependent stochastic model. Cases in the most impoverished communities reported three more contacts on average than cases in high SES communities (p< 0.001). Our transmission model shows that infected individuals from middle and low SES communities were associated with 1.5 (95% CI: 1.4-1.6) and 3.5 (95% CI: 3.1-3.9) times as many secondary cases as those from high SES communities, respectively. Furthermore, most of the spread of Ebola across Montserrado County originated from areas of lower SES. Conclusions/Significance Individuals from areas of poverty were associated with high rates of transmission and spread of Ebola to other regions. Thus, Ebola could most effectively be prevented or contained if disease interventions were targeted to areas of extreme poverty and funding was dedicated to development projects that meet basic needs.","[Fallah, Mosoka P.] Minist Hlth, Community Based Initiat, Monrovia, Liberia; [Fallah, Mosoka P.] Natl Inst Allergy & Infect Dis, PREVAIL Study 3, Monrovia, Liberia; [Fallah, Mosoka P.; Galvani, Alison P.] Univ Liberia, AM Dogliotti Coll Med, Monrovia, Liberia; [Fallah, Mosoka P.; Skrip, Laura A.; Gertler, Shai; Yamin, Dan; Galvani, Alison P.] Yale Univ, Sch Publ Hlth, Ctr Infect Dis Modeling & Anal, New Haven, CT USA; [Yamin, Dan] Tel Aviv Univ, Dept Ind Engn, IL-69978 Tel Aviv, Israel","Fallah, MP (reprint author), Minist Hlth, Community Based Initiat, Monrovia, Liberia.",mfallah1969@gmail.com,,"Gertler, Shai/0000-0001-6132-6360",National Science Foundation (NSF) RAPID Grant [1514673]; National Institutes of Health MIDAS Grant [2U01GM087719-06],"Funding for the analysis was obtained from the National Science Foundation (NSF) RAPID Grant (1514673).

Although generally regarded as a benign cause of malaria, it has been associated with nephrotic syndrome, particularly in young children, and can persist in the host for years. Morbidity associated with P. malariae infection has received relatively little attention, and the risk of P. malariae-associated nephrotic syndrome is unknown. Methodology/Principal Findings We used data from a very large hospital-based surveillance system incorporating information on clinical diagnoses, blood cell parameters and treatment to describe the demographic distribution, morbidity and mortality associated with P. malariae infection in southern Papua, Indonesia. Between April 2004 and December 2013 there were 1,054,674 patient presentations to Mitra Masyarakat Hospital of which 196,380 (18.6%) were associated with malaria and 5,097 were with P. malariae infection (constituting 2.6% of all malaria cases). The proportion of malaria cases attributable to P. malariae increased with age from 0.9% for patients under one year old to 3.1% for patients older than 15 years. Overall, 8.5% of patients with P. malariae infection required admission to hospital and the median length of stay for these patients was 2.5 days (Interquartile Range: 2.0-4.0 days). Patients with P. malariae infection had a lower mean hemoglobin concentration (9.0g/dL) than patients with P. falciparum (9.5g/dL), P. vivax (9.6g/dL) and mixed species infections (9.3g/dL). There were four cases of nephrotic syndrome recorded in patients with P. malariae infection, three of which were in children younger than 5 years old, giving a risk in this age group of 0.47% (95% Confidence Interval; 0.10% to 1.4%). Overall, 2.4% (n = 16) of patients hospitalized with P. malariae infection subsequently died in hospital, similar to the proportions for the other endemic Plasmodium species (range: 0% for P. ovale to 1.6% for P. falciparum). Conclusions/Significance Plasmodium malariae infection is relatively uncommon in Papua, Indonesia but is associated with significant morbidity from anemia and a similar risk of mortality to patients hospitalized with P. falciparum and P. vivax infection. In our large hospital database, one in 200 children under the age of 5 years with P. malariae infection were recorded as having nephrotic syndrome.","[Langford, Siobhan; Douglas, Nicholas M.; Anstey, Nicholas M.; Price, Ric N.] Menzies Sch Hlth Res, Global & Trop Hlth Div, Darwin, NT, Australia; [Langford, Siobhan; Douglas, Nicholas M.; Anstey, Nicholas M.; Price, Ric N.] Charles Darwin Univ, Darwin, NT 0909, Australia; [Douglas, Nicholas M.] Christchurch Hosp, Div Med, Christchurch, New Zealand; [Lampah, Daniel A.; Kenangalem, Enny; Poespoprodjo, Jeanne Rini] Papuan Hlth & Community Dev Fdn, Timika Malaria Res Program, Timika, Papua, Indonesia; [Simpson, Julie A.] Univ Melbourne, Melbourne Sch Populat & Global Hlth, Ctr Biostat & Epidemiol, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Kenangalem, Enny; Poespoprodjo, Jeanne Rini] Mimika Dist Hlth Author, Timika, Papua, Indonesia; [Sugiarto, Paulus] Rumah Sakit Mitra Masyarakat, Timika, Papua, Indonesia; [Anstey, Nicholas M.] Royal Darwin Hosp, Div Med, Darwin, NT, Australia; [Poespoprodjo, Jeanne Rini] Univ Gadjah Mada, Fac Med, Dept Child Hlth, Yogyakarta, Indonesia; [Price, Ric N.] Univ Oxford, Nuffield Dept Clin Med, Ctr Trop Med & Global Hlth, Oxford, England","Langford, S (reprint author), Menzies Sch Hlth Res, Global & Trop Hlth Div, Darwin, NT, Australia.",rprice@menzies.edu.au,,"Price, Richard/0000-0003-2000-2874; Douglas, Nicholas/0000-0002-7214-4244","AusAID (Australian Agency for International Development, Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade); Rhodes Trust; Wellcome Trust [091625]; NHMRC (National Health and Medical Research Council) [1037304]","The Timika Research Facility and Papuan Community Health Foundation were supported by AusAID (Australian Agency for International Development, Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade - http://dfat.gov.au/aid/Pages/australias-aid-program.aspx).

These fungi are characterized by major differences in routes of transmission, host predilections, species virulence, and susceptibilities to antifungals. Sporothrix species emerge in the form of outbreaks. Large zoonoses and sapronoses are ongoing in Brazil and China, respectively. Current diagnostic methods based on morphology and physiology are inaccurate due to closely related phenotypes with overlapping components between pathogenic and non-pathogenic Sporothrix. There is a critical need for new diagnostic tools that are specific, sensitive, and cost-effective. Methodology We developed a panel of novel markers, based on calmodulin (CAL) gene sequences, for the large-scale diagnosis and epidemiology of clinically relevant members of the Sporothrix genus, and its relative, Ophiostoma. We identified specific PCR-based markers for S. brasiliensis, S. schenckii, S. globosa, S. mexicana, S. pallida, and O. stenoceras. We employed a murine model of disseminated sporotrichosis to optimize a PCR assay for detecting Sporothrix in clinical specimens. Results Primer-BLAST searches revealed candidate sequences that were conserved within a single species. Species-specific primers showed no significant homology with human, mouse, or microorganisms outside the Sporothrix genus. The detection limit was 10-100 fg of DNA in a single round of PCR for identifying S. brasiliensis, S. schenckii, S. globosa, S. mexicana, and S. pallida. A simple, direct PCR assay, with conidia as a source of DNA, was effective for rapid, low-cost genotyping. Samples from a murine model of disseminated sporotrichosis confirmed the feasibility of detecting S. brasiliensis and S. schenckii DNA in spleen, liver, lungs, heart, brain, kidney, tail, and feces of infected animals. Conclusions This PCR-based method could successfully detect and identify a single species in samples from cultures and from clinical specimens. The method proved to be simple, high throughput, sensitive, and accurate for diagnosing sporotrichosis.","[Rodrigues, Anderson Messias; de Camargo, Zoilo Pires] Univ Fed Sao Paulo, UNIFESP, Dept Microbiol Imunol & Parasitol, Disciplina Biol Celular, Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil; [Sybren de Hoog, G.] CBS KNAW Fungal Biodivers Ctr, Utrecht, Netherlands","Rodrigues, AM (reprint author), Univ Fed Sao Paulo, UNIFESP, Dept Microbiol Imunol & Parasitol, Disciplina Biol Celular, Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil.",amrodrigues.amr@gmail.com; zpcamargo1@gmail.com,"Camargo, Zoilo/C-5305-2013; Rodrigues, Anderson/C-5915-2013; Rodrigues, Anderson M./V-4069-2019","Camargo, Zoilo/0000-0002-2971-7983; Rodrigues, Anderson/0000-0003-0891-4563; Rodrigues, Anderson M./0000-0003-0891-4563","Sao Paulo Research Foundation [FAPESP 2009/54024-2]; National Council for Scientific and Technological Development [CNPq 472600/2011-7, CNPq 472169/2012-2]; Sao Paulo Research Foundation; National Council for Scientific and Technological Development; Coordination for the improvement of higher education","ZPdC acknowledge financial support from the Sao Paulo Research Foundation (FAPESP 2009/54024-2) and the National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq 472600/2011-7 and CNPq 472169/2012-2).

Recent evidence suggests that parasite glycoconjugates could play a role in the evasion of the immune response, leading to a modified Th2-polarized immune response that favors parasite survival in the host. Nevertheless, there is limited information about the nature or function of glycans produced by the trematode Fasciola hepatica, the causative agent of fasciolosis. In this paper, we investigate whether glycosylated molecules from F. hepatica participate in the modulation of host immunity. We also focus on dendritic cells, since they are an important target of immune-modulation by helminths, affecting their activity or function. Our results indicate that glycans from F. hepatica promote the production of IL-4 and IL-10, suppressing IFN. production. During infection, this parasite is able to induce a semi-mature phenotype of DCs expressing low levels of MHCII and secrete IL-10. Furthermore, we show that parasite glycoconjugates mediate the modulation of LPS-induced maturation of DCs since their oxidation restores the capacity of LPS-treated DCs to secrete high levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and IL-12/23p40 and low levels of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10. Inhibition assays using carbohydrates suggest that the immune-modulation is mediated, at least in part, by the recognition of a mannose specific-CLR that signals by recruiting the phosphatase Php2. The results presented here contribute to the understanding of the role of parasite glycosylated molecules in the modulation of the host immunity and might be useful in the design of vaccines against fasciolosis.","[Rodriguez, Ernesto; Noya, Veronica; Brossard, Natalie; Chiale, Carolina; Freire, Teresa] UdelaR, Dept Immunobiol, Lab Immunomodulat & Vaccine Dev, Fac Med, Montevideo, Uruguay; [Cervi, Laura] Univ Nacl Cordoba, Dept Bioquim Clin, CONICET, Fac Ciencias Quim,CIBICI, RA-5000 Cordoba, Argentina; [Chiribao, Maria Laura] UdelaR, Dept Bioquim, Fac Med, Montevideo, Uruguay; [Carmona, Carlos] UdelaR, Unidad Biol Parasitaria, Dept Biol Celular & Mol, Inst Higiene,Fac Ciencias, Montevideo, Uruguay; [Giacomini, Cecilia] UdelaR, Dept Biociencias, Catedra Bioquim, Fac Quim, Montevideo, Uruguay","Rodriguez, E (reprint author), UdelaR, Dept Immunobiol, Lab Immunomodulat & Vaccine Dev, Fac Med, Montevideo, Uruguay.",tfreire@fmed.edu.uy,,,"Agencia Nacional de Investigacion e Innovacion (ANII, Uruguay) [PR-FCE-2009-1-2782]; Comision Sectorial de Investigacion Cientifica (CSIC, Universidad de la Republica, Uruguay); CSIC; ANII","This work was supported by grants from Agencia Nacional de Investigacion e Innovacion (PR-FCE-2009-1-2782, ANII, Uruguay) and Comision Sectorial de Investigacion Cientifica (CSIC, Universidad de la Republica, Uruguay).

The causative organism is an intracellular bacterium, Chlamydia trachomatis, which is susceptible to single-dose azithromycin [1]. A World Health Organization (WHO)-led program aims to eliminate trachoma as a public health problem globally by 2020 [2]. Yaws is a cause of skin, bone, and cartilage disease. The causative organism is a spirochaete bacterium, Treponema pallidum ssp. pertenue, which is susceptible to single-dose azithromycin [3]. A WHO-led program aims to eradicate yaws globally by 2020 [4]. These diseases are both found in hard-to-reach populations-they affect the poorest people living in the most remote areas of the countries where they're found-and have some apparent similarity in the methods recommended to counter them. Maximum synergy between programs is possible only if the two diseases affect the same communities, and if program goals permit alignment of work. Trachoma's elimination as a public health problem means ""the reduction of disease incidence, prevalence, morbidity or mortality to a locally acceptable level as a result of deliberate efforts"" [5], whereas yaws eradication requires ""permanent reduction to zero of the worldwide incidence of infection caused by a specific agent as a result of deliberate efforts"" [5]-a quite different goal.

Ts-Pmy is a functional protein with binding activity to human complement C8 and C9 and thus plays a role in evading the attack of the host's immune system. In the present study, the binding activity of Ts-Pmy to human complement C1q and its ability to inhibit classical complement activation were investigated. Methods and Findings The binding of recombinant and natural Ts-Pmy to human C1q were determined by ELISA, Far Western blotting and immunoprecipitation, respectively. Binding of recombinant Ts-Pmy (rTs-Pmy) to C1q inhibited C1q binding to IgM and consequently inhibited C3 deposition. The lysis of antibody-sensitized erythrocytes (EAs) elicited by the classical complement pathway was also inhibited in the presence of rTs-Pmy. In addition to inhibiting classical complement activation, rTs-Pmy also suppressed C1q binding to THP-1-derived macrophages, thereby reducing C1q-induced macrophages migration. Conclusion Our results suggest that T. spiralis paramyosin plays an important role in immune evasion by interfering with complement activation through binding to C1q in addition to C8 and C9.","[Sun, Ran; Zhao, Xi; Wang, Zixia; Yang, Jing; Zhao, Limei; Zhu, Xinping] Capital Med Univ, Sch Basic Med Sci, Dept Parasitol, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Zhan, Bin] Baylor Coll Med, Dept Pediat, Natl Sch Trop Med, Houston, TX 77030 USA","Sun, R (reprint author), Capital Med Univ, Sch Basic Med Sci, Dept Parasitol, Beijing, Peoples R China.",zhuxping@ccmu.edu.cn,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China [81171598, 81371837]; Importation and Development of High-Caliber Talents Project of Beijing Municipal Institutions [IDHT20140212]","This study was supported by grants from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (to XZhu) (NO. 81171598, NO. 81371837; URL: http://www.nsfc.gov.cn/) and the Importation and Development of High-Caliber Talents Project of Beijing Municipal Institutions (to BZ) (NO.

Dengue fever spatio-temporal patterns result from complex interactions between the virus, the host, and the vector. These interactions can be influenced by environmental conditions. Our objectives were to analyse dengue fever spatial distribution over New Caledonia during epidemic years, to identify some of the main underlying factors, and to predict the spatial evolution of dengue fever under changing climatic conditions, at the 2100 horizon. Methods We used principal component analysis and support vector machines to analyse and model the influence of climate and socio-economic variables on the mean spatial distribution of 24,272 dengue cases reported from 1995 to 2012 in thirty-three communes of New Caledonia. We then modelled and estimated the future evolution of dengue incidence rates using a regional downscaling of future climate projections. Results The spatial distribution of dengue fever cases is highly heterogeneous. The variables most associated with this observed heterogeneity are the mean temperature, the mean number of people per premise, and the mean percentage of unemployed people, a variable highly correlated with people's way of life. Rainfall does not seem to play an important role in the spatial distribution of dengue cases during epidemics. By the end of the 21st century, if temperature increases by approximately 3 degrees C, mean incidence rates during epidemics could double. Conclusion In New Caledonia, a subtropical insular environment, both temperature and socio-economic conditions are influencing the spatial spread of dengue fever. Extension of this study to other countries worldwide should improve the knowledge about climate influence on dengue burden and about the complex interplay between different factors. This study presents a methodology that can be used as a step by step guide to model dengue spatial heterogeneity in other countries.","[Teurlai, Magali] Inst Pasteur, Epidemiol Infect Dis, Noumea, New Caledonia; [Teurlai, Magali] IRD, ESPACE DEV, UMR 228, Noumea, New Caledonia; [Teurlai, Magali; Menkes, Christophe Eugene] IRD, LOCEAN, UMR 182, Noumea, New Caledonia; [Cavarero, Virgil] Meteo France, Noumea, New Caledonia; [Degallier, Nicolas] IRD, LOCEAN, UMR 182, Paris, France; [Descloux, Elodie] Terr Hosp Ctr, Dept Internal Med & Infect Dis, Noumea, New Caledonia; [Grangeon, Jean-Paul] Direct Hlth & Social Affairs New Caledonia, Dept Hlth, Noumea, New Caledonia; [Guillaumot, Laurent] Inst Pasteur, Med Entomol, Noumea, New Caledonia; [Libourel, Therese; Mangeas, Morgan] Univ Montpellier 2, IRD, ESPACE DEV, UMR 228, Montpellier, France; [Lucio, Paulo Sergio] Univ Fed Rio Grande Norte UFRN, CCET, Natal, RN, Brazil; [Mathieu-Daude, Francoise] IRD, UMR 224, MIVEGEC, Noumea, New Caledonia","Teurlai, M (reprint author), Inst Pasteur, Epidemiol Infect Dis, Noumea, New Caledonia.",mteurlai@pasteur.nc,"menkes, christophe/H-9085-2016; Mangeas, Morgan/J-5170-2016","menkes, christophe/0000-0002-1457-9696; Mathieu-Daude, Francoise/0000-0003-2994-3697; Mangeas, Morgan/0000-0003-4146-3784",Province Sud of New Caledonia; Institute for Research and Development,"MT was supported financially by the Province Sud of New Caledonia which provided a research allocation for supporting Ph.D. students, and by the Institute for Research and Development.

Currently 2.5 billion people are at risk for infection and reduction of Ae. aegypti populations is the most effective means to reduce the risk of transmission. Pyrethroids are used extensively for adult mosquito control, especially during dengue outbreaks. Pyrethroids promote activation and prolong the activation of the voltage gated sodium channel protein (VGSC) by interacting with two distinct pyrethroid receptor sites [ 1], formed by the interfaces of the transmembrane helix subunit 6 (S6) of domains II and III. Mutations of S6 in domains II and III synergize so that double mutants have higher pyrethroid resistance than mutants in either domain alone. Computer models predict an allosteric interaction between mutations in the two domains. In Ae. aegypti, a Ile1,016 mutation in the S6 of domain II was discovered in 2006 and found to be associated with pyrethroid resistance in field populations in Mexico. In 2010 a second mutation, Cys1,534 in the S6 of domain III was discovered and also found to be associated with pyrethroid resistance and correlated with the frequency of Ile1,016. Methodology/Principal Findings A linkage disequilibrium analysis was performed on Ile1,016 and Cys1,534 in Ae. aegypti collected in Mexico from 2000-2012 to test for statistical associations between S6 in domains II and III in natural populations. We estimated the frequency of the four dilocus haplotypes in 1,016 and 1,534: Val1,016/Phe1,534 (susceptible), Val1,016/Cys1,534, Ile1,016/Phe1,534, and Ile1,016/Cys1,534 (resistant). The susceptible Val1,016/Phe1,534 haplotype went from near fixation to extinction and the resistant Ile1,016/Cys1,534 haplotype increased in all collections from a frequency close to zero to frequencies ranging from 0.5-0.9. The Val1,016/Cys1,534 haplotype increased in all collections until 2008 after which it began to decline as Ile1,016/Cys1,534 increased. However, the Ile1,016/Phe1,534 haplotype was rarely detected; it reached a frequency of only 0.09 in one collection and subsequently declined. Conclusion/Significance Pyrethroid resistance in the vgsc gene requires the sequential evolution of two mutations. The Ile1,016/Phe1,534 haplotype appears to have low fitness suggesting that Ile1,016 was unlikely to have evolved independently. Instead the Cys1,534 mutation evolved first but conferred only a low level of resistance. Ile1,016 in S6 of domain II then arose from the Val1,016/Cys1,534 haplotype and was rapidly selected because double mutants confer higher pyrethroid resistance. This pattern suggests that knowledge of the frequencies of mutations in both S6 in domains II and III are important to predict the potential of a population to evolve kdr. Susceptible populations with high Val1,016/Cys1,534 frequencies are at high risk for kdr evolution, whereas susceptible populations without either mutation are less likely to evolve high levels of kdr, at least over a 10 year period.","[Vera-Maloof, Farah Z.; Saavedra-Rodriguez, Karla; Elizondo-Quiroga, Armando E.; Lozano-Fuentes, Saul; Black, William C.] Colorado State Univ, Dept Microbiol Immunol & Pathol, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA","Vera-Maloof, FZ (reprint author), Colorado State Univ, Dept Microbiol Immunol & Pathol, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA.",wcb4@lamar.colostate.edu,,"Saavedra-Rodriguez, Karla/0000-0001-8511-3327",Fogarty Training Grant "Training in Dengue Prevention and Control" [2D43TW001130-08]; National Institutes of Health/National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIH/NIAID; International Collaborations in Infectious Disease Research Program) [U01-AI-088647],"This work was supported by Fogarty Training Grant 2D43TW001130-08 ""Training in Dengue Prevention and Control.""

Erythrocytes are lysed in the lumen, leucocytes are tethered and killed and platelets are eliminated. We know little about the proteins secreted from the two glands that mediate these biological processes. Methodology/Principal Findings We have used subtractive RNA-Seq to characterise the complement of genes that are differentially expressed in a head preparation, compared to matched tissues from worm tails. The expression site of representative highlighted genes was then validated using whole munt in situ hybridisation (WISH). Mapping of transcript reads to the S. mansoni genome assembly using Cufflinks identified similar to 90 genes that were differentially expressed >fourfold in the head preparation; similar to 50 novel transcripts were also identified by de novo assembly using Trinity. The largest subset (27) of secreted proteins was encoded by microexon genes (MEGs), the most intense focus identified to date. Expression of three (MEGs 12, 16, 17) was confirmed in the anterior gland and five (MEGs 8.1, 9, 11, 15 and 22) in the posterior gland. The other major subset comprised nine lysosomal hydrolases (aspartyl proteases, phospholipases and palmitoyl thioesterase), again localised to the glands. Conclusions A proportion of the MEG-encoded secretory proteins can be classified by their primary structure. We have suggested testable hypotheses about how they might function, in conjunction with the lysosomal hydrolases, to mediate the biological processes that occur in the esophagus lumen. Antibodies bind to the esophageal secretions in both permissive and self-curing hosts, suggesting that the proteins represent a novel panel of untested vaccine candidates. A second major task is to identify which of them can serve as immune targets.","[Wilson, R.

The disease is a serious public health problem in Africa and the Middle East, and is a potential global health threat. In Kenya, outbreaks of the disease have disproportionately affected impoverished pastoralist communities. This study sought to assess the knowledge, attitudes and practices (KAP) regarding RVF among the pastoralists of North Eastern Kenya, and to establish the determinants of KAP on RVF. A cross-sectional study involving 392 pastoralists living in Ijara district (Masalani and Ijara wards) was carried out using an interview questionnaire. All respondents interviewed (100%) had heard about RVF disease. They recognized that the disease is dangerous (99%), and had a positive attitude towards vaccination of animals (77%). However, few respondents knew that abortion (11%) and high mortality of young animals (10%) were key signs of RVF in animals. Very few (4%) use any form of protection when handling sick animals to avoid infection. Significant factors associated with knowledge were being in a household with a history of RVF infection (OR = 1.262, 95% CI = 1.099-1.447), having more livestock (OR = 1.285, 95% CI = 1.175-1.404) and the place of residence, Masalani (OR = 0.526, 95% CI = 0.480-0.576). Overall knowledge score on RVF was found to be a significant predictor of good preventive practice of the disease (OR = 1.073, 95% CI = 1.047-1.101). Despite the positive attitude that pastoralist communities have towards the prevention of RVF, there exist gaps in knowledge and good practices on the disease. Therefore there is need for public health education to address these gaps, and to identify and facilitate the removal of barriers to behavioural change related to the prevention of RVF.","[Abdi, Ismail H.; Wanjoya, Anthony K.] Jomo Kenyatta Univ Agr & Technol, Dept Stat & Actuarial Sci, Nairobi, Kenya; [Abdi, Ismail H.; Affognon, Hippolyte D.] Int Ctr Insect Physiol & Ecol, Social Sci & Impact Assessment Unit, Nairobi, Kenya; [Affognon, Hippolyte D.] Int Crops Res Inst Semi Arid Trop, Bamako, Mali; [Onyango-Ouma, Washington] Univ Nairobi, Inst Anthropol Gender & African Studies, Nairobi, Kenya; [Sang, Rosemary] Int Ctr Insect Physiol & Ecol, Human Hlth Div, Nairobi, Kenya","Abdi, IH (reprint author), Jomo Kenyatta Univ Agr & Technol, Dept Stat & Actuarial Sci, Nairobi, Kenya.",haffognon@icipe.org,"Onyango-Ouma, Washington/F-5604-2016","Onyango-Ouma, Washington/0000-0002-2723-7900","International Development Research Center (IDRC), IDRC [105509-038]","This research was funded by the International Development Research Center (IDRC), IDRC Grant Number: 105509-038.

Loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP), a simple, robust and cost-effective technology, has been selected as a promising POC test candidate. Three BUD-specific LAMP assays are available to date, but various technical challenges still hamper decentralized application. To overcome the requirement of cold-chains for transport and storage of reagents, the aim of this study was to establish a dry-reagent-based LAMP assay (DRB-LAMP) employing lyophilized reagents. Methodology/Principal Findings Following the design of an IS2404 based conventional LAMP (cLAMP) assay suitable to apply lyophilized reagents, a lyophylization protocol for the DRB-LAMP format was developed. Clinical performance of cLAMP was validated through testing of 140 clinical samples from 91 suspected BUD cases by routine assays, i.e. IS2404 dry-reagent-based (DRB) PCR, conventional IS2404 PCR (cPCR), IS2404 qPCR, compared to cLAMP. Whereas qPCR rendered an additional 10% of confirmed cases and samples respectively, case confirmation and positivity rates of DRB-PCR or cPCR (64.84% and 56.43%; 100% concordant results in both assays) and cLAMP (62.64% and 52.86%) were comparable and there was no significant difference between the sensitivity of the assays (DRB PCR and cPCR, 86.76%; cLAMP, 83.82%). Likewise, sensitivity of cLAMP (95.83%) and DRB-LAMP (91.67%) were comparable as determined on a set of 24 samples tested positive in all routine assays. Conclusions/Significance Both LAMP formats constitute equivalent alternatives to conventional PCR techniques. Provided the envisaged availability of field friendly DNA extraction formats, both assays are suitable for decentralized laboratory confirmation of BUD, whereby DRB-LAMP scores with the additional advantage of not requiring cold-chains. As validation of the assays was conducted in a third-level laboratory environment, field based evaluation trials are necessary to determine the clinical performance at peripheral health care level.","[Beissner, Marcus; Bauer, Malkin; Rhomberg, Agata; Huber, Kristina Lydia; Symank, Dominik; Jansson, Moritz; Herbinger, Karl-Heinz; Loescher, Thomas; Bretzel, Gisela] Univ Munich, Dept Infect Dis & Trop Med DITM, Univ Hosp, Munich, Germany; [Phillips, Richard Odame; Sarfo, Fred Stephen] Kwame Nkrumah Univ Sci & Technol, Komfo Anokye Teaching Hosp KATH, Kumasi, Ghana; [Battke, Florian] Battke Scientia GmbH, Taufkirchen, Germany; [Badziklou, Kossi; Maman, Issaka; Kere, Abiba Banla] Minist Sante, Natl Inst Hyg, Lome, Togo; [Piten, Ebekalisai] Ctr Hosp Reg Maritime, Tsevie, Togo; [Frimpong, Michael] Kwame Nkrumah Univ Sci & Technol, Kumasi Ctr Collaborat Res Trop Med KCCR, Komfo Anokye Teaching Hosp, Kumasi, Ghana; [Wiedemann, Franz Xaver] German Leprosy & TB Relief Assoc, Togo Off DAHW T, Lome, Togo","Beissner, M (reprint author), Univ Munich, Dept Infect Dis & Trop Med DITM, Univ Hosp, Munich, Germany.",beissner@lrz.uni-muenchen.de,,"Phillips, Richard/0000-0001-8992-0222; Frimpong, Michael/0000-0003-1901-6793",European Community [241500]; Medical Research Council [MR/J01477X/1],"This work was supported by the European Community's Seventh Framework Programme (FP7/2007-2013) under grant agreement No 241500 (BuruliVac) (ROP, FXW, GB).

This study aims to estimate the magnitude of association of individual-level and village-level factors with current human cysticercosis in 60 villages located in three Provinces of Burkina Faso. Methodology/Principal Findings Baseline cross-sectional data collected between February 2011 and January 2012 from a large community randomized-control trial were used. A total of 3609 individuals provided serum samples to assess current infection with cysticercosis. The association between individual and village-level factors and the prevalence of current infection with cysticercosis was estimated using Bayesian hierarchical logistic models. Diffuse priors were used for all regression coefficients. The prevalence of current cysticercosis varied across provinces and villages ranging from 0% to 11.5%. The results obtained suggest that increased age, being male and consuming pork as well as a larger proportion of roaming pigs and percentage of sand in the soil measured at the village level were associated with higher prevalences of infection. Furthermore, consuming pork at another village market had the highest increased prevalence odds of current infection. Having access to a latrine, living in a household with higher wealth quintiles and a higher soil pH measured at the village level decreased the prevalence odds of cysticercosis. Conclusions/Significance This is the first large-scale study to examine the association between variables measured at the individual-, household-, and village-level and the prevalence odds of cysticercosis in humans. Factors linked to people, pigs, and the environment were of importance, which further supports the need for a One Health approach to control cysticercosis infection.","[Carabin, Helene; Cowan, Linda D.] Univ Oklahoma, Dept Biostat & Epidemiol, Coll Publ Hlth, Hlth Sci Ctr, Oklahoma City, OK 73019 USA; [Millogo, Athanase] Ctr Hosp Univ Souro Sanou, Bobo Dioulasso, Burkina Faso; [Cisse, Assana; Tarnagda, Zekiba] Inst Rech & Sci Sante, Bobo Dioulasso, Burkina Faso; [Gabriel, Sarah; Dorny, Pierre] Inst Trop Med, Dept Biomed Sci, B-2000 Antwerp, Belgium; [Sahlu, Ida] Brown Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Epidemiol, Providence, RI USA; [Sahlu, Ida] Brown Univ, Populat Studies & Training Ctr, Providence, RI 02912 USA; [Bauer, Cici] Brown Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Biostat, Providence, RI USA; [Ganaba, Rasmane] Agence Format Rech & Expertise Sante Afr AFRICSan, Bobo Dioulasso, Burkina Faso","Carabin, H (reprint author), Univ Oklahoma, Dept Biostat & Epidemiol, Coll Publ Hlth, Hlth Sci Ctr, Oklahoma City, OK 73019 USA.",helene-carabin@ouhsc.edu,"Dorny, Pierre/B-8590-2008",,National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS); Forgarty International Center (FIC) of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) under the Brain in the Developing World: Research across the life span program [R01NS064901]; National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) [2T32HD007338],"This work was conducted with the support of the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) and of the Forgarty International Center (FIC) of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) under the Brain in the Developing World: Research across the life span program, grant R01NS064901.

Currently, the majority of epidemic cholera reported globally is El Tor biotype Vibrio cholerae isolates of the serogroup O1. However, in Bangladesh, outbreaks attributed to V. cholerae serogroup O139 isolates, which fall within the same phylogenetic lineage as the O1 serogroup isolates, were seen between 1992 and 1993 and in 2002 to 2005. Since then, V. cholerae serogroup O139 has only been sporadically isolated in Bangladesh and is now rarely isolated elsewhere. Methods Here, we present case histories of four cholera patients infected with V. cholerae serogroup O139 in 2013 and 2014 in Bangladesh. We comprehensively typed these isolates using conventional approaches, as well as by whole genome sequencing. Phenotypic typing and PCR confirmed all four isolates belonging to the O139 serogroup. Findings Whole genome sequencing revealed that three of the isolates were phylogenetically closely related to previously sequenced El Tor biotype, pandemic 7, toxigenic V. cholerae O139 isolates originating from Bangladesh and elsewhere. The fourth isolate was a non-toxigenic V. cholerae that, by conventional approaches, typed as O139 serogroup but was genetically divergent from previously sequenced pandemic 7 V. cholerae lineages belonging to the O139 or O1 serogroups. Conclusion These results suggest that previously observed lineages of V. cholerae O139 persist in Bangladesh and can cause clinical disease and that a novel disease-causing non-toxigenic O139 isolate also occurs.","[Chowdhury, Fahima; Begum, Yasmin Ara; Asaduzzaman, Muhammad; Baby, Nabilah; Sharmin, Salma; Biswas, Rajib; Uddin, Muhammad Ikhtear; Clemens, John D.; Qadri, Firdausi] Int Ctr Diarrhoeal Dis Res, Icddr B, Dhaka, Bangladesh; [Mather, Alison E.; Thomson, Nicholas R.] Wellcome Trust Sanger Inst, Cambridge, England; [LaRocque, Regina C.; Harris, Jason B.; Calderwood, Stephen B.; Ryan, Edward T.] Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Boston, MA 02114 USA; [LaRocque, Regina C.; Calderwood, Stephen B.; Ryan, Edward T.] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Boston, MA USA; [Clemens, John D.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Fielding Sch Publ Hlth, Los Angeles, CA USA; [Thomson, Nicholas R.] London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, Dept Pathogen Mol Biol, London WC1, England","Chowdhury, F (reprint author), Int Ctr Diarrhoeal Dis Res, Icddr B, Dhaka, Bangladesh.",fqadri@icddrb.org,"Thomson, Nicholas/P-5988-2014; Bhutta, Zulfiqar/L-7822-2015; Asaduzzaman, Muhammad/O-5081-2017","Thomson, Nicholas/0000-0002-4432-8505; Bhutta, Zulfiqar/0000-0003-0637-599X; Asaduzzaman, Muhammad/0000-0001-9048-7980","Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation [OPP50419]; National Institutes of Health [U01A1077883, R01AI106878, U01AI058935]; Government of Australia; Government of Bangladesh; Government of Canada; Government of Sweden; Government of UK; Wellcome Trust [098051]; Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council [BB/M014088/1]","This study was supported by a Grant OPP50419 from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and National Institutes of Health (U01A1077883, R01AI106878 and U01AI058935).

DENV first establishes infection in the midgut of Aedes aegypti and spreads to various mosquito organs for lifelong infection. Curiously, studies have shown that infectious DENV titers peak and decrease thereafter in the midgut despite relatively stable viral genome levels. However, the mechanisms that regulate this decoupling of infectious virion production from viral RNA replication have never been determined. We show here that the ubiquitin proteasome pathway (UPP) plays an important role in regulating infectious DENV production. Using RNA interference studies, we show in vivo that knockdown of selected UPP components reduced infectious virus production without altering viral RNA replication in the midgut. Furthermore, this decoupling effect could also be observed after RNAi knockdown in the head/thorax of the mosquito, which otherwise showed direct correlation between infectious DENV titer and viral RNA levels. The dependence on the UPP for successful DENV production is further reinforced by the observed upregulation of key UPP molecules upon DENV infection that overcome the relatively low expression of these genes after a blood meal. Collectively, our findings indicate an important role for the UPP in regulating DENV production in the mosquito vector.","[Choy, Milly M.; Sessions, October M.; Gubler, Duane J.; Ooi, Eng Eong] Duke Natl Univ Singapore, Grad Sch Med, Program Emerging Infect Dis, Singapore, Singapore; [Ooi, Eng Eong] Singapore MIT Alliance Res & Technol, Interdisciplinary Res Grp Infect Dis, Singapore, Singapore","Choy, MM (reprint author), Duke Natl Univ Singapore, Grad Sch Med, Program Emerging Infect Dis, Singapore, Singapore.",engeong.ooi@duke-nus.edu.sg,,"Ooi, Eng Eong/0000-0002-0520-1544",Singapore National Research Foundation [NMRC/CSA/0060/2014],"This work was supported by the Singapore National Research Foundation under its Clinician-Scientist Award (NMRC/CSA/0060/2014), administered by the National Medical Research Council.

However, no licensed vaccine or specific antiviral treatment for dengue is available. DENV interacts with host cell factors to complete its life cycle although this virus-host interplay remains to be fully elucidated. Many studies have identified the ubiquitin proteasome pathway (UPP) to be important for successful DENV production, but how the UPP contributes to DENV life cycle as host factors remains ill defined. We show here that proteasome inhibition decouples infectious virus production from viral RNA replication in antibody-dependent infection of THP-1 cells. Molecular and imaging analyses in beta-lactone treated THP-1 cells suggest that proteasome function does not prevent virus assembly but rather DENV egress. Intriguingly, the licensed proteasome inhibitor, bortezomib, is able to inhibit DENV titers at low nanomolar drug concentrations for different strains of all four serotypes of DENV in primary monocytes. Furthermore, bortezomib treatment of DENV-infected mice inhibited the spread of DENV in the spleen as well as the overall pathological changes. Our findings suggest that preventing DENV egress through proteasome inhibition could be a suitable therapeutic strategy against dengue.","[Choy, Milly M.; Zhang, Summer L.; Tan, Hwee Cheng; Ooi, Eng Eong] Duke Natl Univ Singapore, Grad Sch Med, Program Emerging Infect Dis, Singapore, Singapore; [Costa, Vivian V.; Ooi, Eng Eong] Singapore MIT Alliance Res & Technol, Interdisciplinary Res Grp Infect Dis, Singapore, Singapore; [Horrevorts, Sophie] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Med Ctr, Dept Mol Cell Biol & Immunol, Amsterdam, Netherlands","Choy, MM (reprint author), Agcy Sci Technol & Res, Genome Inst Singapore, Singapore, Singapore.",engeong.ooi@duke-nus.edu.sg,"Costa, Vivian/I-2499-2018","Costa, Vivian/0000-0002-0175-642X; Ooi, Eng Eong/0000-0002-0520-1544; Zhang, Summer Lixin/0000-0002-9762-4711",Singapore National Research Foundation under its Clinician-Scientist Award [NMRC/CSA/0060/2014],"This work was supported by the Singapore National Research Foundation under its Clinician-Scientist Award (NMRC/CSA/0060/2014), administered by the National Medical Research Council.

Their de novo biosynthesis involves transformation of glucose-6-phosphate into glucose-1-phosphate by the phosphoglucomutase and subsequent activation into UDP-Glc by the specific UDP-Glc pyrophosphorylase (UGP). Besides UGP, Leishmania parasites express an uncommon UDP-sugar pyrophosphorylase (USP) able to activate both galactose-1-phosphate and glucose-1-phosphate in vitro. Targeted gene deletion of UGP alone was previously shown to principally affect expression of lipophosphoglycan, resulting in a reduced virulence. Since our attempts to delete both UGP and USP failed, deletion of UGP was combined with conditional destabilisation of USP to control the biosynthesis of UDP-Glc and UDP-Gal. Stabilisation of the enzyme produced by a single USP allele was sufficient to maintain the steady-state pools of these two nucleotide sugars and preserve almost normal glycoinositolphospholipids galactosylation, but at the apparent expense of lipophosphoglycan biosynthesis. However, under destabilising conditions, the absence of both UGP and USP resulted in depletion of UDP-Glc and UDP-Gal and led to growth cessation and cell death, suggesting that either or both of these metabolites is/are essential.","[Damerow, Sebastian; Hoppe, Carolin; Zarnovican, Patricia; Buettner, Falk R.; Routier, Francoise H.] Hannover Med Sch, Dept Cellular Chem, Hannover, Germany; [Bandini, Giulia; Ferguson, Michael A.

The life cycle of mycobacteria is complex and the mechanisms resulting in pathogen infection and survival in host cells are not fully understood. Recently, comparative genomics analyses have provided new insights into the evolution and adaptation of the MTBC to survive inside the host. However, most of this information has been obtained using M. tuberculosis but not other members of the MTBC such as M. bovis and M. caprae. In this study, the genome of three M. bovis (MB1, MB3, MB4) and one M. caprae (MB2) field isolates with different lesion score, prevalence and host distribution phenotypes were sequenced. Genome sequence information was used for whole-genome and protein-targeted comparative genomics analysis with the aim of finding correlates with phenotypic variation with potential implications for tuberculosis (TB) disease risk assessment and control. At the whole-genome level the results of the first comparative genomics study of field isolates of M. bovis including M. caprae showed that as previously reported for M. tuberculosis, sequential chromosomal nucleotide substitutions were the main driver of the M. bovis genome evolution. The phylogenetic analysis provided a strong support for the M. bovis/M. caprae clade, but supported M. caprae as a separate species. The comparison of the MB1 and MB4 isolates revealed differences in genome sequence, including gene families that are important for bacterial infection and transmission, thus highlighting differences with functional implications between isolates otherwise classified with the same spoligotype. Strategic protein-targeted analysis using the ESX or type VII secretion system, proteins linking stress response with lipid metabolism, host T cell epitopes of mycobacteria, antigens and peptidoglycan assembly protein identified new genetic markers and candidate vaccine antigens that warrant further study to develop tools to evaluate risks for TB disease caused by M. bovis/M. caprae and for TB control in humans and animals.","[de la Fuente, Jose; Diez-Delgado, Iratxe; Contreras, Marinela; Vicente, Joaquin; Gortazar, Christian] SaBio, Inst Invest Recursos Cineget IREC CSIC UCLM JCCM, Ciudad Real, Spain; [de la Fuente, Jose] Oklahoma State Univ, Ctr Vet Hlth Sci, Dept Vet Pathobiol, Stillwater, OK 74078 USA; [Diez-Delgado, Iratxe] Univ Complutense Madrid, Fac Vet, Dept Sanidad Anim, Madrid, Spain; [Cabezas-Cruz, Alejandro] Univ Lille, Inst Pasteur Lille, Ctr Infect & Immun Lille, INSERM U1019,CNRS UMR 8204, Lille, France; [Tobes, Raquel; Manrique, Marina] Era7 Bioinformat, Oh No Sequences Res Grp, Granada, Spain; [Romero, Beatriz; Bezos, Javier; Dominguez, Lucas] Univ Complutense Madrid, Ctr Vigilancia Sanitaria Veterinaria VISAVET, Madrid, Spain; [Bezos, Javier] MAEVA SERVET SL, Madrid, Spain; [Sevilla, Iker A.; Garrido, Joseba M.; Juste, Ramon] NEIKER Tecnalia, Inst Vasco Invest & Desarrollo Agr, Dept Sanidad Anim, Vizcaya, Spain; [Madico, Guillermo; Jones-Lopez, Edward] Boston Med Ctr, Dept Med, Infect Dis Sect, Boston, MA USA; [Madico, Guillermo; Jones-Lopez, Edward] Boston Univ, Sch Med, Boston, MA 02118 USA","de la Fuente, J (reprint author), SaBio, Inst Invest Recursos Cineget IREC CSIC UCLM JCCM, Ciudad Real, Spain.",Christian.Gortazar@uclm.es,"Bezos, Javier/K-1335-2014; Garrido, Javier Bezos/Q-2536-2019; Romero, Beatriz/J-5942-2015; Rojo, Marinela Contreras/R-4474-2019; Cabezas-Cruz, Alejandro/P-2755-2017; Sevilla, Iker/O-6060-2014; Gortazar, Christian/E-7918-2012","Bezos, Javier/0000-0003-1913-0545; Garrido, Javier Bezos/0000-0003-1913-0545; Romero, Beatriz/0000-0001-5263-1806; Cabezas-Cruz, Alejandro/0000-0002-8660-730X; Sevilla, Iker/0000-0003-3968-3390; Gortazar, Christian/0000-0003-0012-4006; Jones Lopez, Edward/0000-0001-6323-286X","Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad, Spain [AGL2014-56305, IPT-2011-0735-010000]; European Union FP7 ANTIGONE grant [278976]; Horizon 2020 COMPARE Grant [377/14]","This research was supported by grants AGL2014-56305 and IPT-2011-0735-010000 from Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad, Spain, and the European Union FP7 ANTIGONE grant 278976 and Horizon 2020 COMPARE Grant 377/14.

The worldwide studies of its insecticide resistance have demonstrated a strong loss of susceptibility to pyrethroids, the major class of insecticide used for vector control. French overseas territories such as French Guiana (South America), Guadeloupe islands (Lesser Antilles) as well as New Caledonia (Pacific Ocean), have encountered such resistance. Methodology/Principal Findings We initiated a research program on the pyrethroid resistance in French Guiana, Guadeloupe and New Caledonia. Aedes aegypti populations were tested for their deltamethrin resistance level then screened by an improved microarray developed to specifically study metabolic resistance mechanisms. Cytochrome P450 genes were implicated in conferring resistance. CYP6BB2, CYP6M11, CYP6N12, CYP9J9, CYP9J10 and CCE3 genes were upregulated in the resistant populations and were common to other populations at a regional scale. The implication of these genes in resistance phenomenon is therefore strongly suggested. Other genes from detoxification pathways were also differentially regulated. Screening for target site mutations on the voltage-gated sodium channel gene demonstrated the presence of I1016 and C1534. Conclusion/significance This study highlighted the presence of a common set of differentially up-regulated detoxifying genes, mainly cytochrome P450 genes in all three populations. GUA and GUY populations shared a higher number of those genes compared to CAL. Two kdr mutations well known to be associated to pyrethroid resistance were also detected in those two populations but not in CAL. Different selective pressures and genetic backgrounds can explain such differences. These results are also compared with those obtained from other parts of the world and are discussed in the context of integrative research on vector competence.","[Dusfour, Isabelle; Guidez, Amandine; Issaly, Jean; Girod, Romain] Inst Pasteur, Unite Entomol Med, Cayenne, French Guiana; [Zorrilla, Pilar; Robello, Carlos] Inst Pasteur Montevideo, Unidad Biol Mol, Montevideo, Uruguay; [Zorrilla, Pilar; Robello, Carlos] Sch Med, Dept Biochem, Montevideo, Uruguay; [Guillaumot, Laurent] Inst Pasteur Nouvelle Caledonie, Unite Rech & Expertise Entomol Med, Noumea, New Caledonia; [Strode, Clare] Edge Hill Univ, Dept Biol, Ormskirk, Lancs, England","Dusfour, I (reprint author), Inst Pasteur, Unite Entomol Med, Cayenne, French Guiana.",idusfour@pasteur-cayenne.fr,"ROBELLO, CARLOS/M-5609-2019","ROBELLO, CARLOS/0000-0001-6985-6171; Dusfour, Isabelle/0000-0002-5265-8432; Strode, Clare/0000-0003-2833-8073",Institut Pasteur [ACIP-A-03-2010]; "Investissement d'Avenir" grant [ANR-10-LABX-25-01]; European commission within the FP7 [REGPOT-CT-2011-285837-STRonGer],"This work was funded by the Institut Pasteur funds through the ACIP-A-03-2010 (www.pasteur.fr).

Methodology We compared the number and location of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) identified by genomic screening between four pairs of Mycobacterium ulcerans isolates collected at the time of first diagnosis and at recurrence, derived from a collection of almost 5000 well characterized clinical samples from one BU treatment center in Benin. Principal Findings The findings suggest that after surgical treatment-without antibiotics-the second episodes were due to relapse rather than reinfection. Since specific antibiotics were introduced for the treatment of BU, the one patient with a culture available from both disease episodes had M. ulcerans isolates with a genomic distance of 20 SNPs, suggesting the patient was most likely reinfected rather than having a relapse. Conclusions To our knowledge, this study is the first to study recurrences in M. ulcerans using NGS, and to identify exogenous reinfection as causing a recurrence of BU. The occurrence of reinfection highlights the contribution of ongoing exposure to M. ulcerans to disease recurrence, and has implications for vaccine development.","[Eddyani, Miriam; Vandelannoote, Koen; Meehan, Conor J.; Portaels, Francoise; de Jong, Bouke C.] Inst Trop Med, Dept Biomed Sci, B-2000 Antwerp, Belgium; [Bhuju, Sabin; Jarek, Michael; Singh, Mahavir] GMAK, Helmholtz Ctr Infect Res, Braunschweig, Germany; [Porter, Jessica L.; Stinear, Timothy P.] Univ Melbourne, Dept Microbiol & Immunol, Doherty Inst Infect & Immun, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Aguiar, Julia] Ctr Depistage & Traitement Ulcere Buruli Gbemotin, Zagnanado, Benin; [Seemann, Torsten] Univ Melbourne, Victorian Life Sci Computat Initiat, Parkville, Vic 3052, Australia; [de Jong, Bouke C.] NYU, New York, NY USA","Eddyani, M (reprint author), Inst Trop Med, Dept Biomed Sci, B-2000 Antwerp, Belgium.",meddyani@itg.be,"de Jong, Bouke/A-3636-2013; Seemann, Torsten/B-2318-2010","de Jong, Bouke/0000-0002-1017-4675; Seemann, Torsten/0000-0001-6046-610X; Meehan, Conor/0000-0003-0724-8343","UBS Optimus Foundation (Zurich, Switzerland); Department of Economy, Science and Innovation of the Flemish Government (Belgium); VLADOC PhD scholarship of VLIR-UOS (Belgium)","This work was supported by the UBS Optimus Foundation (Zurich, Switzerland) and the Department of Economy, Science and Innovation of the Flemish Government (Belgium).

Studies evaluating the level of knowledge of medical students in clinical and socio-demographic aspects of NTD are lacking. Therefore, a cross-sectional study was conducted among students from a 7 year-curriculum medical school in Peru to assess their knowledge of NTD by using a pilot survey comprised by two blocks of 10 short questions. Block I consisted of socio-demographic and epidemiological questions whereas block II included clinical vignettes. Each correct answer had the value of 1 point. Out of 597 responders (response rate: 68.4%), 583 were considered to have valid surveys (male: female ratio: 1: 1.01; mean age 21 years, SD +/- 2.42). Total knowledge showed a raising trend through the 7-year curriculum. Clinical knowledge seemed to improve towards the end of medical school whereas socio-demographic and epidemiological concepts only showed progress the first 4 years of medical school, remaining static for the rest of the curricular years (p = 0.66). Higher mean scores in socio-demographic and epidemiological knowledge compared to clinical knowledge were seen in the first two years (p< 0.001) whereas the last three years showed higher scores in clinical knowledge (p< 0.001). In conclusion, students from this private medical school gained substantial knowledge in NTD throughout the career which seems to be related to improvement in clinical knowledge rather than to socio-demographic and epidemiological concepts. This study assures the feasibility of measuring the level of knowledge of NTD in medical students and stresses the importance of evaluating education on NTD as it may need more emphasis in epidemiological concepts, especially at developing countries such as Peru where many people are affected by these preventable and treatable diseases.","[Errea, Renato A.; Vasquez-Rios, George; Susana Gallardo, Maria; Cornejo, Marilhia; Urquiaga, Jorge F.; Montoya, Diego; Zamudio, Rodrigo; Samalvides, Frine] Univ Peruana Cayetano Heredia, Fac Med Alberto Hurtado, Lima, Peru; [Errea, Renato A.; Vasquez-Rios, George; Machicado, Jorge D.; Terashima, Angelica; Marcos, Luis A.; Samalvides, Frine] Univ Peruana Cayetano Heredia, Inst Med Trop Alexander von Humboldt, Lima, Peru; [Machicado, Jorge D.] Univ Pittsburgh, Med Ctr, Div Gastroenterol Hepatol & Nutr, Pittsburgh, PA USA; [Marcos, Luis A.] SUNY Stony Brook, Dept Med, Div Infect Dis, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA","Errea, RA (reprint author), Univ Peruana Cayetano Heredia, Fac Med Alberto Hurtado, Lima, Peru.",renato.errea@upch.pe,,,,,,22,0,0,0,1,PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE,SAN FRANCISCO,"1160 BATTERY STREET, STE 100, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94111 USA",1935-2735,,,PLOS NEGLECT TROP D,Plos Neglect.

Anecdotally referred to as a ""silent killer,"" it leads to the development of potentially fatal cardiac disease in approximately 30% of those infected. In an attempt to better understand the potential of Chagas disease as a significant underlying cause of morbidity in Texas, we performed a historical literature review to assess disease burden. Human reports of triatomine bites and disease exposure were found to be prevalent in Texas. Despite current beliefs that Chagas disease is a recently emerging disease, we report historical references dating as far back as 1935. Both imported cases and autochthonous transmission contribute to the historical disease burden in Texas. We end by discussing the current knowledge gaps, and recommend priorities for advancing further epidemiologic studies and their policy implications.","[Garcia, Melissa N.; Woc-Colburn, Laila; Hotez, Peter J.; Murray, Kristy O.] Baylor Coll Med, Dept Pediat, Natl Sch Trop Med, Houston, TX 77030 USA; [Garcia, Melissa N.; Woc-Colburn, Laila; Hotez, Peter J.; Murray, Kristy O.] Texas Childrens Hosp, Houston, TX 77030 USA; [Woc-Colburn, Laila; Aguilar, David] Baylor Coll Med, Dept Med, Houston, TX 77030 USA","Garcia, MN (reprint author), Baylor Coll Med, Dept Pediat, Natl Sch Trop Med, Houston, TX 77030 USA.",mnolan@bcm.edu,,"Woc-Colburn, Laila/0000-0003-2888-7806; Hotez, Peter/0000-0001-8770-1042",NIDDK NIH HHS [P30 DK056338],,,70,21,21,0,8,PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE,SAN FRANCISCO,"1160 BATTERY STREET, STE 100, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94111 USA",1935-2735,,,PLOS NEGLECT TROP D,Plos Neglect.

Although there are many epidemiological studies linking trachoma to factors normally associated with poverty, formal quantitative data linking trachoma to household economic poverty within endemic communities is very limited. Methodology/Principal Findings Two hundred people with trachomatous trichiasis were recruited through community-based screening in Amhara Region, Ethiopia. These were individually matched by age and gender to 200 controls without trichiasis, selected randomly from the same sub-village as the case. Household economic poverty was measured through (a) A broad set of asset-based wealth indicators and relative household economic poverty determined by principal component analysis (PCA, (b) Self-rated wealth, and (c) Peer-rated wealth. Activity participation data were collected using a modified 'Stylised Activity List' developed for the World Bank's Living Standards Measurement Survey. Trichiasis cases were more likely to belong to poorer households by all measures: asset-based analysis (OR = 2.79; 95% CI: 2.06-3.78; p<0.0001), self-rated wealth (OR, 4.41, 95% CI, 2.75-7.07; p< 0.0001) and peer-rated wealth (OR, 8.22, 95% CI, 4.59-14.72; p< 0.0001). Cases had less access to latrines (57% v 76.5%, p = < 0.0001) and higher person-to-roomdensity (4.0 v 3.31; P = 0.0204) than the controls. Compared to controls, cases were significantly less likely to participate in economically productive activities regardless of visual impairment and other health problems, more likely to report difficulty in performing activities and more likely to receive assistance in performing productive activities. Conclusions/Significance This study demonstrated a strong association between trachomatous trichiasis and relative poverty, suggesting a bidirectional causative relationship possibly may exist between poverty and trachoma. Implementation of the full SAFE strategy in the context of general improvements might lead to a virtuous cycle of improving health and wealth. Trachoma is a good proxy of inequality within communities and it could be used to target and evaluate interventions for health and poverty alleviation.","[Habtamu, Esmael; Rajak, Saul N.; Burton, Matthew J.] London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, Int Ctr Eye Hlth, London WC1, England; [Habtamu, Esmael; Wondie, Tariku; Aweke, Sintayehu; Tadesse, Zerihun; Zerihun, Mulat] Carter Ctr, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia; [Zewdie, Zebideru] Amhara Reg Hlth Bur, Bahirdar, Ethiopia; [Callahan, Kelly] Emory Univ, Carter Ctr, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA; [Emerson, Paul M.] Int Trachoma Initiat, Atlanta, GA USA; [Kuper, Hannah; Polack, Sarah] London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, Int Ctr Evidence Disabil, London WC1, England; [Bailey, Robin L.; Mabey, David C.

We measured vision and health-related QoL in a case-control study in Amhara Region, Ethiopia. Methodology/Principal Findings We recruited 1000 adult trichiasis cases and 200 trichiasis-free controls, matched to every fifth trichiasis case on age (+/- two years), sex and location. Vision-related quality of life (VRQoL) and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) were measured using the WHO/PBD-VF20 and WHOQOL-BREF questionnaires. Comparisons were made using linear regression adjusted for age, sex and socioeconomic status. Trichiasis cases had substantially lower VRQoL than controls on all subscales (overall eyesight, visual symptom, general functioning and psychosocial, p<0.0001), even in the sub-group with normal vision (p<0.0001). Lower VRQoL scores in cases were associated with longer trichiasis duration, central corneal opacity, visual impairment and poor contrast sensitivity. Trichiasis cases had lower HRQoL in all domains (Physical-health, Psychological, Social, Environment, p<0.0001), lower overall QoL (mean, 34.5 v 64.6; p<0.0001) and overall health satisfaction (mean, 38.2 v 71.7; p<0.0001). This association persisted in a sub-group analysis of cases and controls with normal vision. Not having a marriage partner (p<0.0001), visual impairment (p = 0.0068), daily labouring (p<0.0001), presence of other health problems (p = 0.0018) and low self-rated wealth (p<0.0001) were independently associated with lower overall QoL scores in cases. Among cases, trichiasis caused 596 (59%) to feel embarrassed, 913 (91.3%) to worry they may lose their remaining eyesight and 681 (68.1%) to have sleep disturbance. Conclusions/Significance Trachomatous trichiasis substantially reduces vision and health related QoL and is disabling, even without visual impairment. Prompt trichiasis intervention is needed both to prevent vision loss and to alleviate physical and psychological suffering, social exclusion and improve overall well-being. Implementation of the full SAFE strategy is needed to prevent the development of trachomatous trichiasis.","[Habtamu, Esmael; Rajak, Saul N.; Burton, Matthew J.] London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, Int Ctr Eye Hlth, London WC1, England; [Habtamu, Esmael; Wondie, Tariku; Aweke, Sintayehu; Tadesse, Zerihun; Zerihun, Mulat] Carter Ctr, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia; [Zewudie, Zebideru; Gebeyehu, Wondimu] Amhara Reg Hlth Bur, Bahirdar, Ethiopia; [Callahan, Kelly] Emory Univ, Carter Ctr, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA; [Emerson, Paul M.] Int Trachoma Initiat, Atlanta, GA USA; [Kuper, Hannah; Polack, Sarah] London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, Int Ctr Evidence Disabil, London WC1, England; [Bailey, Robin L.; Mabey, David C.

In a trial study in which armadillos were artificially infected with M. leprae, these techniques were specific and sensitive to pathogen detection, while more traditional ELISAs were only specific. These assays were then employed in a case study to detect M. leprae as well as MTBC in wild marmosets. All marmosets were negative for M. leprae DNA, but 14 were positive for the mycobacterial rpoB gene assay. Targeted capture and sequencing of rpoB and other MTBC genes validated the presence of mycobacterial DNA in these samples and revealed that qPCR is useful for identifying mycobacterial-infected animal hosts.","[Housman, Genevieve; Malukiewicz, Joanna; Stone, Anne C.] Arizona State Univ, Sch Human Evolut & Social Change, Tempe, AZ 85281 USA; [Malukiewicz, Joanna; Boere, Vanner] Univ Fed Vicosa, Dept Bioquim & Biol Mol, Vicosa, MG, Brazil; [Grativol, Adriana D.; Ruiz-Miranda, Carlos R.] Univ Estadual Norte Fluminense, Ctr Biociencias & Biotecnol, Lab Ciencias Ambientias, Rio De Janeiro, Brazil; [Pereira, Luiz Cezar M.] Univ Fed Vale Sao Francisco, Ctr Conservacao & Manejo Fauna Caatinga, Petrolina, PE, Brazil; [e Silva, Ita de Oliveira] Univ Fed Vicosa, Dept Biol Anim, Vicosa, MG, Brazil; [Truman, Richard] NIAID, HHS HRSA HSB Natl Hansens Dis Program, IAA 2646, Baton Rouge, LA USA","Housman, G (reprint author), Arizona State Univ, Sch Human Evolut & Social Change, Tempe, AZ 85281 USA.",ghousman@asu.edu,"Ruiz, Carlos R/I-4446-2016","Housman, Genevieve/0000-0002-3482-7511; Stone, Anne/0000-0001-8021-8314","National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases [NIAID IAA-2646]; National Science Foundation [NSF BCS-1063939, NSF DDIG-1061508]; Fulbright Scholar Program; International Primatological Society; Arizona State University Chapter of Sigma Xi; Arizona State University Graduate and Professional Student Association","This work was supported by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (www.niaid.nih.gov) [NIAID IAA-2646 to RT]; the National Science Foundation (www.nsf.gov) [NSF BCS-1063939 to ACS and NSF DDIG-1061508 to JM]; the Fulbright Scholar Program (www.cies.org) [Fellowship to JM]; the International Primatological Society (www.internationalprimatologicalsociety.org) [Research Grant to JM]; the Arizona State University Chapter of Sigma Xi (sigmaxi.asu.edu) [GIAR to JM]; and the Arizona State University Graduate and Professional Student Association (gpsa.asu.edu) [Jumpstart and Research Grant to JM].

There has been renewed interest from policy makers to reduce the burden of Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTDs) such as onchocerciasis on individuals and households. This paper provides new information on the patient's perceptions of onchocerciasis and its economic burden on households in South-eastern Nigeria. The information will be useful to health providers and policy makers for evidence-informed resource allocation decisions. Methods Information was generated from a cross-sectional household survey conducted in Achi community, Oji River Local Government Area (LGA) of Enugu State, Southeast Nigeria. A pretested interviewer-administered questionnaire was used to collect data. A total of 747 households were visited randomly and data were collected using pre-tested interviewer administered questionnaire from 370 respondents. The respondents' knowledge of the cause of symptoms of the disease, costs incurred for seeking treatment and productivity losses were elicited. Data were analyzed using tabulations and inferential statistics. A socio-economic status (SES) index was used to disaggregate some key variables by SES quintiles for equity analysis. Results Many people had more than one type of manifestation of onchocerciasis. However, more than half of the respondents (57%) had no knowledge of the cause of their symptoms. Male respondents had significantly more knowledge of the cause of symptoms than females (P = 0.04) but knowledge did not differ across SES (P = 0.82). The average monthly treatment cost per respondent was US$ 14.0. Drug cost (US$ 10) made up about 72% of total treatment cost. The per capita productivity loss among patients was US$ 16 and it was higher in the poorest (Q1) (US$ 20) and the third SES quintiles (Q3) (US$ 21). The average monthly productivity loss among caregivers was US$ 3.5. Conclusion Onchocerciasis still constitutes considerable economic burden on patients due to the high cost of treatment and productivity loss. Prioritizing domestic resource allocation for the treatment of onchocerciasis is important for significant and sustained reduction in the burden of the disease. In addition, focused health promotion interventions such as health education campaigns should be scaled up in onchocerciasis-endemic communities.","[Ibe, Ogochukwu; Onwujekwe, Obinna] Univ Nigeria, Coll Med, Dept Pharmacol & Therapeut, Hlth Policy Res Grp, Enugu, Nigeria; [Onwujekwe, Obinna] Univ Nigeria, Fac Hlth Sci, Dept Hlth Adm & Management, Enugu, Nigeria; [Uzochukwu, Benjamin] Univ Nigeria, Coll Med, Dept Community Med, Enugu, Nigeria; [Ajuba, Miriam] Enugu State Coll Sci & Technol, Dept Community Med, Enugu, Nigeria; [Okonkwo, Paul] Univ Nigeria, Coll Med, Dept Pharmacol & Therapeut, Enugu, Nigeria","Ibe, O (reprint author), Univ Nigeria, Coll Med, Dept Pharmacol & Therapeut, Hlth Policy Res Grp, Enugu, Nigeria.",mypaskie@yahoo.co.uk,,,,,,35,3,3,0,1,PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE,SAN FRANCISCO,"1160 BATTERY STREET, STE 100, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94111 USA",1935-2735,,,PLOS NEGLECT TROP D,Plos Neglect.

Objective To update global and regional coverage estimates of pre-SAC deworming in 2013 by supplementing data from the WHO Preventive Chemotherapy and Transmission Control (PCT) databank with national CHD data. Methods UNICEF country offices (n = 82) were mailed a questionnaire in July 2014 to report on official national biannual CHD deworming coverage as part of the global vitamin A supplementation coverage reporting mechanism. Coverage data obtained were validated and considered for inclusion in the PCT databank in a collaboration between UNICEF and WHO. Descriptive statistical analyses were conducted to update the number of pre-SAC reached and the number of treatments delivered. Results Of the 47 countries that responded to the UNICEF pre-SAC deworming questionnaire, 73 data points from 39 countries were considered for inclusion into the WHO PCT databank. Of these, 21 new data points were from 12 countries were newly integrated into the WHO database. With this integration, deworming coverage among pre-SAC increased to 49.1%, representing an increase in the number of children reached and treatments administered from 63.7 million to 130.7 million and 94.7 million to 234.8 million, respectively. The updated databank comprised 98 mass deworming activities conducted in 55 countries, in which 80.4% of the global pre-SAC population requiring deworming reside. In all, 57 countries requiring deworming were not yet represented in the database. Conclusions With the inclusion of CHD data, global deworming programs are on track to achieving global pre-SAC coverage targets. However, further efforts are needed to improve pre-SAC coverage reporting as well as to sustain and expand deworming delivery through CHDs and other platforms.","[Kumapley, Richard Senam; Kupka, Roland] UNICEF Headquarters, Micronutrients Unit, Nutr Sect, New York, NY 10038 USA; [Dalmiya, Nita] UNICEF Reg Off West & Cent Africa, Nutr Sect, Dakar, Senegal","Kumapley, RS (reprint author), UNICEF Headquarters, Micronutrients Unit, Nutr Sect, New York, NY 10038 USA.",rkupka@unicef.org,,,"Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation [OPP1118856]; Canadian Department of Foreign Affairs, Trade and Development [M013618-003]; Nutrition Section at UNICEF headquarters","This study was supported by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, http://www.gatesfoundation.org/ (OPP1118856) and the Canadian Department of Foreign Affairs, Trade and Development, http://www.international.gc.ca/international/index.aspx?lang=eng (M013618-003).

J,"Kuno, G",,,,"Kuno, Goro",,,A Re-Examination of the History of Etiologic Confusion between Dengue and Chikungunya,PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES,,,English,Review,,,,,,,HEMORRHAGIC-FEVER,"Contrary to the perception of many researchers that the recent invasion of chikungunya (CHIK) in the Western Hemisphere marked the first episode in history, a recent publication reminded them that CHIK had prevailed in the West Indies and southern regions of the United States from 1827-1828 under the guise of ""dengue"" (DEN), and that many old outbreaks of so-called ""dengue"" actually represented the CHIK cases erroneously identified as ""dengue."" In hindsight, this confusion was unavoidable, given that the syndromes of the two diseases-transmitted by the same mosquito vector in urban areas-are very similar, and that specific laboratory-based diagnostic techniques for these diseases did not exist prior to 1940. While past reviewers reclassified problematic ""dengue"" outbreaks as CHIK, primarily based on manifestation of arthralgia as a marker of CHIK, they neither identified the root cause of the alleged misdiagnosis nor did they elaborate on the negative consequences derived from it. This article presents a reconstructed history of the genesis of the clinical definition of dengue by emphasizing problems with the definition, subsequent confusion with CHIK, and the ways in which physicians dealt with the variation in dengue-like (""dengue"") syndromes. Then, the article identifies in those records several factors complicating reclassification, based on current practice and standards. These factors include terms used for characterizing joint problems, style of documenting outbreak data, frequency of manifestation of arthralgia, possible involvement of more than one agent, and occurrence of the principal vector. The analysis of those factors reveals that while some of the old ""dengue"" outbreaks, including the 1827-1828 outbreaks in the Americas, are compatible with CHIK, similar reclassification of other "" dengue"" outbreaks to CHIK is difficult because of a combination of the absence of pathognomonic syndrome in these diseases and conflicting background information.","[Kuno, Goro] Ctr Dis Control & Prevent, Div Vector Borne Infect Dis, Atlanta, GA USA",,gykuno@gmail.com,,,,,,59,17,17,0,4,PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE,SAN FRANCISCO,"1160 BATTERY STREET, STE 100, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94111 USA",1935-2735,,,PLOS NEGLECT TROP D,Plos Neglect.

However, opportunities for broad taxonomic sampling have been scarce, and analyses were based mainly on 12S rDNA and coxI gene sequences. While being suitable for species differentiation, these mitochondrial genes cannot be used to infer phylogenetic hypotheses at higher taxonomic levels. In the present study, 48 species, representing seven of eight subfamilies within the Onchocercidae, were sampled and sequences of seven gene loci (nuclear and mitochondrial) analysed, resulting in the hitherto largest molecular phylogenetic investigation into this family. Although our data support the current hypothesis that the Oswaldofilariinae, Waltonellinae and Icosiellinae subfamilies separated early from the remaining onchocercids, Setariinae was recovered as a well separated clade. Dirofilaria, Loxodontofilaria and Onchocerca constituted a strongly supported clade despite belonging to different subfamilies (Onchocercinae and Dirofilariinae). Finally, the separation between Splendidofilariinae, Dirofilariinae and Onchocercinae will have to be reconsidered.","[Lefoulon, Emilie; Bain, Odile; Bourret, Jerome; Martin, Coralie] Univ Paris 04, Museum Natl Hist Nat, Unite Mol Commun & Adaptat Microorganismes, F-75230 Paris 05, France; [Junker, Kerstin] ARC Onderstepoort Vet Inst, Onderstepoort, South Africa; [Guerrero, Ricardo; Canizales, Israel] Cent Univ Venezuela, Fac Ciencias, Inst Zool & Ecol Trop, Lab Biol Vectores & Parasitos, Caracas, Venezuela; [Kuzmin, Yuriy] Ukrainian Natl Acad Sci, Inst Zool, Kiev, Ukraine; [Satoto, Tri Baskoro T.] Univ Gadjah Mada, Jl Tekn Utara Yogyakarta, Ctr Trop Med, Yogyakarta, Indonesia; [Cardenas-Callirgos, Jorge Manuel] Asociac Peruana Helmintol & Invertebrados Afines, Lima, Peru; [Lima, Sueli de Souza] Univ Fed Juiz de Fora, Inst Ciencias Biol, Dept Zool, LTEH ODILE BAIN, Juiz De Fora, MG, Brazil; [Raccurt, Christian] Lab Natl Sante Publ, Portau Prince, Haiti; [Mutafchiev, Yasen] Bulgarian Acad Sci, Inst Biodivers & Ecosyst Res, Sofia, Bulgaria; [Gavotte, Laurent] Univ Montpellier, F-34059 Montpellier, France","Lefoulon, E (reprint author), Univ Paris 04, Museum Natl Hist Nat, Unite Mol Commun & Adaptat Microorganismes, F-75230 Paris 05, France.",cmartin@mnhn.fr,"Mutafchiev, Yasen/J-7586-2012; martin, coralie/O-3983-2019; Martin, Coralie/N-6293-2018; Kuzmin, Yuriy/H-1736-2015","Mutafchiev, Yasen/0000-0002-7901-7205; martin, coralie/0000-0003-3801-2595; Kuzmin, Yuriy/0000-0002-1723-1265; Lefoulon, Emilie/0000-0002-5246-9914; Guerrero, Ricardo/0000-0003-0925-9476; Laurent, Gavotte/0000-0002-6730-0767",Interdisciplinary Programs of the MNHN; European Community [FP7-HEALTH-EPIAF-243121],"This work was supported by the Interdisciplinary Programs of the MNHN (ATM Biodiversite actuelle et fossile.

However, very little is known about less abundant surface proteins and their role in host-parasite interactions. Methodology/Principal Findings Here, we described a novel family of T. cruzi surface membrane proteins (TcSMP), which are conserved among different T. cruzi lineages and have orthologs in other Trypanosoma species. TcSMP genes are densely clustered within the genome, suggesting that they could have originated by tandem gene duplication. Several lines of evidence indicate that TcSMP is a membrane-spanning protein located at the cellular surface and is released into the extracellular milieu. TcSMP exhibited the key elements typical of surface proteins (N-terminal signal peptide or signal anchor) and a C-terminal hydrophobic sequence predicted to be a trans-membrane domain. Immunofluorescence of live parasites showed that anti-TcSMP antibodies clearly labeled the surface of all T. cruzi developmental forms. TcSMP peptides previously found in a membrane-enriched fraction were identified by proteomic analysis in membrane vesicles as well as in soluble forms in the T. cruzi secretome. TcSMP proteins were also located intracellularly likely associated with membrane-bound structures. We demonstrated that TcSMP proteins were capable of inhibiting metacyclic trypomastigote entry into host cells. TcSMP bound to mammalian cells and triggered Ca2+ signaling and lysosome exocytosis, events that are required for parasitophorous vacuole biogenesis.The effects of TcSMP were of lower magnitude compared to gp82, the major adhesion protein of metacyclic trypomastigotes, suggesting that TcSMP may play an auxiliary role in host cell invasion. Conclusion/Significance We hypothesized that the productive interaction of T. cruzi with host cells that effectively results in internalization may depend on diverse adhesion molecules. In the metacyclic forms, the signaling induced by TcSMP may be additive to that triggered by the major surface molecule gp82, further increasing the host cell responses required for infection.","[Martins, Nadini Oliveira; de Souza, Renata Torres; Cordero, Esteban Mauricio; Maldonado, Danielle Cortez; Cortez, Cristian; Marini, Marjorie Mendes; Ferreira, Eden Ramalho; Bayer-Santos, Ethel; Yoshida, Nobuko; da Silveira, Jose Franco] Univ Fed Sao Paulo, Escola Paulista Med, Dept Microbiol Imunol & Parasitol, Sao Paulo, Brazil; [de Almeida, Igor Correia] Univ Texas El Paso, Dept Biol Sci, Border Biomed Res Ctr, El Paso, TX 79968 USA","Martins, NO (reprint author), Univ Fed Sao Paulo, Escola Paulista Med, Dept Microbiol Imunol & Parasitol, Sao Paulo, Brazil.",jose.franco@unifesp.br,"Cordero, Esteban M./Q-6513-2019; Franco da Silveira, Jose/F-5390-2012; Bayer-Santos, Ethel/O-5505-2014; Cordero, Esteban M/F-2511-2012; Ferreira, Eden/E-5326-2016","Cordero, Esteban M./0000-0002-6099-5113; Bayer-Santos, Ethel/0000-0003-3832-3449; Cordero, Esteban M/0000-0002-6099-5113; Ferreira, Eden/0000-0001-6534-0426; Almeida, Igor/0000-0002-2443-8213","FAPESP [11/51475-3]; CNPq; CAPES; National Institutes of Health (NIH) [R01AI070655-A5, R01AI070655-A5S1]; EC; National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities (NIMHD), a component of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) [2G12MD007592];  [NIH/NIMHD2G12MD007592]","This work was supported by grants from FAPESP (11/51475-3), CNPq and CAPES to JFdS and NY, and the National Institutes of Health (NIH) grants R01AI070655-A5 and R01AI070655-A5S1 to ICdA.

Doublesex (Dsx), a terminal transcription factor in the sex determination pathway, is known to regulate sex-specific gene expression during development of the dengue fever vector mosquito Aedes aegypti. Here, the effects of developmental siRNA-mediated dsx silencing were assessed in adult females. Targeting of dsx during A. aegypti development resulted in decreased female wing size, a correlate for body size, which is typically larger in females. siRNA-mediated targeting of dsx also resulted in decreased length of the adult female proboscis. Although dsx silencing did not impact female membrane blood feeding or mating behavior in the laboratory, decreased fecundity and fertility correlated with decreased ovary length, ovariole length, and ovariole number in dsx knockdown females. Dsx silencing also resulted in disruption of olfactory system development, as evidenced by reduced length of the female antenna and maxillary palp and the sensilla present on these structures, as well as disrupted odorant receptor expression. Female lifespan, a critical component of the ability of A. aegypti to transmit pathogens, was also significantly reduced in adult females following developmental targeting of dsx. The results of this investigation demonstrate that silencing of dsx during A. aegypti development disrupts multiple sex-specific morphological, physiological, and behavioral traits of adult females, a number of which are directly or indirectly linked to mosquito reproduction and pathogen transmission. Moreover, the olfactory phenotypes observed connect Dsx to development of the olfactory system, suggesting that A. aegypti will be an excellent system in which to further assess the developmental genetics of sex-specific chemosensation.","[Mysore, Keshava; Tomchaney, Michael; Adams, Haley; Piscoya, Andres S.; Severson, David W.; Duman-Scheel, Molly] Indiana Univ Sch Med, Dept Med & Mol Genet, South Bend, IN 46617 USA; [Mysore, Keshava; Sun, Longhua; Tomchaney, Michael; Sullivan, Gwyneth; Adams, Haley; Severson, David W.; Syed, Zainulabeuddin; Duman-Scheel, Molly] Univ Notre Dame, Eck Inst Global Hlth, Notre Dame, IN 46556 USA; [Sun, Longhua; Tomchaney, Michael; Adams, Haley; Severson, David W.; Syed, Zainulabeuddin; Duman-Scheel, Molly] Univ Notre Dame, Dept Biol Sci, Notre Dame, IN 46556 USA","Mysore, K (reprint author), Indiana Univ Sch Med, Dept Med & Mol Genet, South Bend, IN 46617 USA.",mscheel@nd.edu,"Mysore, Keshava/P-6248-2019; syed, zainulabeuddin/L-4961-2016","Mysore, Keshava/0000-0003-2794-7029; syed, zainulabeuddin/0000-0002-6235-7115",Indiana University School of Medicine Bert Elwert Award in Medicine Research Enhancement Grant,"This study was funded by an Indiana University School of Medicine Bert Elwert Award in Medicine Research Enhancement Grant to MDS, http://operations.medicine.iu.edu/research-administration/internal-and-local-research-funding/reg/.

This study aimed to identify individual and household level determinants of primary VL in 24 highly endemic villages of Tabarak Allah hospital's catchment area, Gedaref State, Sudan. Methods From September 2012 to July 2013, in an unmatched case-control design, 198 patients with primary VL were compared to 801 controls free of VL symptoms and with a negative VL rapid test. Using random spatial sampling, controls were selected with a distribution of age, sex and village of residence proportionate to the distribution of the target population. Data were collected using a structured questionnaire. Results Children and men were at higher risk of VL. Reporting VL patient(s) in the household in the previous year was the strongest VL risk factor. In a multivariate analysis, VL risk increased with household size, sleep location (outside the yard, not in the farm), evening outdoor activities in the rainy season (playing, watching TV, radio listening), use of ground nut oil as animal repellent and of smoke of Acacia seyal as indoor repellent, presence of dogs in the yard at night, Acacia nilotica in the yard's immediate surroundings and of a forest at eye range. VL risk appeared to decrease with the use of drinking water sources other than the village water tank, a buffer distance from the adjacent house yard, and with the presence of animals other than dogs in the yard at night. In contrast with previous studies, housing factors, mosquito-net use, black cotton soil, ethnicity, socioeconomic index, presence of Balanites aegyptica and Azadirachta indica in the yard were not independent VL determinants. Discussion and conclusion Although these results do not provide evidence of causality, they provide useful suggestions for guiding further intervention studies on VL preventive measures.","[Nackers, Fabienne; Mueller, Yolanda Kathrin; Etard, Jean-Francois] Epictr, Paris, France; [Salih, Niven; Hammam, Omer; Mumina, Ann; Atia, Atia Abdalla] Med Sans Frontieres, Operat Ctr Geneva, Khartoum, Sudan; [Elhag, Mousab Siddig] Fed Minist Hlth, Neglected Trop Dis Div, Khartoum, Sudan; [Elbadawi, Mobarak Elnour] State Minist Hlth, Gedaref, Sudan; [Etard, Jean-Francois] Univ Montpellier, Inst Rech Dev, F-34059 Montpellier, France; [Ritmeijer, Koert] Med Sans Frontieres, Operat Ctr Amsterdam, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Chappuis, Francois] Med Sans Frontieres, Operat Ctr Geneva, Geneva, Switzerland; [Chappuis, Francois] Univ Hosp Geneva, Dept Community Med, Geneva, Switzerland","Nackers, F (reprint author), Epictr, Paris, France.",Fabienne.Nackers@Brussels.msf.org,"Etard, Jean Francois/A-9630-2008; Etard, Jean-Francois/V-4865-2019","Etard, Jean Francois/0000-0002-4873-0788; Etard, Jean-Francois/0000-0002-4873-0788; Mueller, Yolanda/0000-0002-8861-4538","Medecins Sans Frontieres, Switzerland (MSF-OCG)","This study was funded by Medecins Sans Frontieres, Switzerland (MSF-OCG).

Inadequate reporting of key aspects of experimental design may reduce the impact of studies and could act as a barrier to translation of research findings. Reporting of animal use must be as comprehensive as possible in order to take advantage of every study and every animal used. Animal models are essential to understanding and assessing new chemotherapy candidates for Chagas disease pathology, a widespread parasitic disease with few treatment options currently available. A systematic review was carried out to compare ARRIVE guidelines recommendations with information provided in publications of preclinical studies for new anti-Trypanosoma cruzi compounds. A total of 83 publications were reviewed. Before ARRIVE guidelines, 69% of publications failed to report any macroenvironment information, compared to 57% after ARRIVE publication. Similar proportions were observed when evaluating reporting of microenvironmental information (56% vs. 61%). Also, before ARRIVE guidelines publication, only 13% of papers described animal gender, only 18% specified microbiological status and 13% reported randomized treatment assignment, among other essential information missing or incomplete. Unfortunately, publication of ARRIVE guidelines did not seem to enhance reporting quality, compared to papers appeared before ARRIVE publication. Our results suggest that there is a strong need for the scientific community to improve animal use description, animal models employed, transparent reporting and experiment design to facilitate its transfer and application to the affected human population. Full compliance with ARRIVE guidelines, or similar animal research reporting guidelines, would be an excellent start in this direction.","[Nicolas Gulin, Julian Ernesto; Marisa Rocco, Daniela; Garcia-Bournissen, Facundo] Hosp Ninos Dr Ricardo Gutierrez, Serv Parasitol & Enfermedad Chagas, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [Nicolas Gulin, Julian Ernesto; Garcia-Bournissen, Facundo] Consejo Nacl Invest Cient & Tecn, RA-1033 Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [Marisa Rocco, Daniela] Minist Ciencia Tecnol & Innovac Prod, Agencia Nacl Promoc Cient & Tecnol, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina","Gulin, JEN (reprint author), Hosp Ninos Dr Ricardo Gutierrez, Serv Parasitol & Enfermedad Chagas, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina.",jgulin@fvet.uba.ar,"GARCIA-BOURNISSEN, FACUNDO/E-8286-2015","GARCIA-BOURNISSEN, FACUNDO/0000-0002-8732-247X",,,,33,16,17,0,3,PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE,SAN FRANCISCO,"1160 BATTERY STREET, STE 100, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94111 USA",1935-2735,,,PLOS NEGLECT TROP D,Plos Neglect.

DENV is divided into four major serotypes, and infection with one serotype leads to immunity against the same, but not the other serotypes. The specific diagnosis of DENV-infections via antibody-detection is problematic due to the high degree of cross-reactivity displayed by antibodies against related flaviviruses, such as West Nile virus (WNV), Yellow Fever virus (YFV) or Tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV). Especially in areas where several flaviviruses co-circulate or in the context of vaccination e.g. against YFV or TBEV, this severely complicates diagnosis and surveillance. Most flavivirus cross-reactive antibodies are produced against the highly conserved fusion loop (FL) domain in the viral envelope (E) protein. We generated insect-cell derived recombinant E-proteins of the four DENV-serotypes which contain point mutations in the FL domain. By using specific mixtures of these mutant antigens, cross-reactivity against heterologous flaviviruses was strongly reduced, enabling sensitive and specific diagnosis of the DENV-infected serum samples in IgG and IgM-measurements. These results have indications for the development of serological DENV-tests with improved specificity.","[Rockstroh, Alexandra; Ulbert, Sebastian] Fraunhofer Inst Cell Therapy & Immunol, Dept Immunol, Leipzig, Germany; [Barzon, Luisa; Pacenti, Monia; Palu, Giorgio] Univ Padua, Dept Mol Med, Padua, Italy; [Niedrig, Matthias] Robert Koch Inst, Berlin, Germany","Ulbert, S (reprint author), Fraunhofer Inst Cell Therapy & Immunol, Dept Immunol, Leipzig, Germany.",Sebastian.ulbert@izi.fraunhofer.de,"Barzon, Luisa/K-7961-2016","Barzon, Luisa/0000-0003-0720-8456",,,,29,10,11,0,3,PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE,SAN FRANCISCO,"1160 BATTERY STREET, STE 100, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94111 USA",1935-2735,,,PLOS NEGLECT TROP D,Plos Neglect.

In this study, spatial and temporal variations in the incidence of hospitalized cases (IHC) of epilepsy and NCC in Ecuadorian municipalities were analyzed. Additionally, potential socio-economic and landscape indicators were evaluated in order to understand in part the macro-epidemiology of the Taenia solium taeniasis/cysticercosis complex. Methodology Data on the number of hospitalized epilepsy and NCC cases by municipality of residence were obtained from morbidity-hospital systems in Ecuador. SatScan software was used to determine whether variations in the IHC of epilepsy and NCC in space and time. In addition, several socio-economic and landscape variables at municipality level were used to study factors intervening in the macro-epidemiology of these diseases. Negative Binomial regression models through stepwise selection and Bayesian Model Averaging (BMA) were used to explain the variations in the IHC of epilepsy and NCC. Principal findings Different clusters were identified through space and time. Traditional endemic zones for NCC and epilepsy, recognized in other studies were confirmed in our study. However, for both disorders more recent clusters were identified. Among municipalities, an increasing tendency for IHC of epilepsy, and a decreasing tendency for the IHC of NCC were observed over time. In contrast, within municipalities a positive linear relationship between both disorders was found. An increase in the implementation of systems for eliminating excrements would help to reduce the IHC of epilepsy by 1.00% (IC95%; 0.2%-1.8%) and by 5.12% (IC95%; 3.63%-6.59%) for the IHC of NCC. The presence of pig production was related to IHC of NCC. Conclusion/Significance Both disorders were related to the lack of an efficient system for eliminating excrements. Given the appearance of recent epilepsy clusters, these locations should be studied in depth to discriminate epilepsies due to NCC from epilepsies due to other causes. Field studies are needed to evaluate the true prevalence of cysticercosis in humans and pigs in different zones of the country in order to better implement and manage prevention and/or control campaigns.","[Ron-Garrido, Lenin; Coral-Almeida, Marco; Benitez-Ortiz, Washington] Univ Cent Ecuador, Ctr Int Zoonosis, Quito, Ecuador; [Ron-Garrido, Lenin; Coral-Almeida, Marco; Gabriel, Sarah; Dorny, Pierre; Berkvens, Dirk; Abatih, Emmanuel Nji] Inst Trop Med, Dept Biomed Sci, B-2000 Antwerp, Belgium; [Ron-Garrido, Lenin; Saegerman, Claude] Univ Liege, Res Unit Epidemiol & Risk Anal Appl Vet Sci UREAR, Fundamental & Appl Res Anim & Hlth, Fac Vet Med, Liege, Belgium; [Coral-Almeida, Marco] Amer Univ, Escuela Med Vet & Zootecnia, Quito, Ecuador; [Coral-Almeida, Marco; Dorny, Pierre] Univ Ghent, Fac Vet Med, Merelbeke, Belgium","Ron-Garrido, L (reprint author), Univ Cent Ecuador, Ctr Int Zoonosis, Ciudadela Univ, Quito, Ecuador.",marco.coralalmeida@ugent.be,"Dorny, Pierre/B-8590-2008","Coral, Marco/0000-0003-0211-2906","Institute of Tropical Medicine in Antwerp, Belgium; Centro Internacional de Zoonosis of the Central University of Ecuador","This work was financially supported by the Belgian Cooperation in the framework of the Institutional Collaboration between the Institute of Tropical Medicine in Antwerp, Belgium and the Centro Internacional de Zoonosis of the Central University of Ecuador.

The One Health approach is a recommended strategy to identify drivers of the disease and plan for its prevention and control. In that context, the aim of this study was to analyze the distribution of human cases of leptospirosis in the State of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil, and to explore possible drivers. Additionally, it sought to provide further evidence to support interventions and to identify hypotheses for new research at the human-animal-ecosystem interface. Methodology and findings The risk for human infection was described in relation to environmental, socioeconomic, and livestock variables. This ecological study used aggregated data by municipality (all 496). Data were extracted from secondary, publicly available sources. Thematic maps were constructed and univariate analysis performed for all variables. Negative binomial regression was used for multivariable statistical analysis of leptospirosis cases. An annual average of 428 human cases of leptospirosis was reported in the state from 2008 to 2012. The cumulative incidence in rural populations was eight times higher than in urban populations. Variables significantly associated with leptospirosis cases in the final model were: Parana/Paraiba ecoregion (RR: 2.25; CI95%: 2.03-2.49); Neossolo Litolitico soil (RR: 1.93; CI95%: 1.26-2.96); and, to a lesser extent, the production of tobacco (RR: 1.10; CI95%: 1.09-1.11) and rice (RR: 1.003; CI95%: 1.002-1.04). Conclusion Urban cases were concentrated in the capital and rural cases in a specific ecoregion. The major drivers identified in this study were related to environmental and production processes that are permanent features of the state. This study contributes to the basic knowledge on leptospirosis distribution and drivers in the state and encourages a comprehensive approach to address the disease in the animal-human-ecosystem interface.","[Schneider, Maria Cristina; Najera, Patricia; Leone, Mariana; Aldighieri, Sylvain; Espinal, Marcos A.] Pan Amer Hlth Org, Dept Communicable Dis & Hlth Anal, Washington, DC 20037 USA; [Pereira, Martha M.] Fundacao Oswaldo Cruz, Ctr Colaborador Org Mundial Saude, Lab Referencia Nacl Leptospirose, Rio De Janeiro, Brazil; [Machado, Gustavo; Corbellini, Luis G.] Univ Fed Rio Grande do Sul, Dept Vet Prevent Med, Fac Med Vet, Lab Epidemiol Vet, Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil; [dos Anjos, Celso B.] Secretaria Saude Rio Grande do Sul, Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil; [Rodrigues, Rogerio O.] Fundacao Estadual Pesquisa Agr FEPAGRO, Inst Pesquisas Vet Desiderio Finamor, Eldorado Do Sul, RS, Brazil; [Cavagni, Gabriela M.] Secretaria Agr Pecuaria Sul, Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil; [Munoz-Zanzi, Claudia] Univ Minnesota, Sch Publ Hlth, Div Epidemiol & Community Hlth, Minneapolis, MN USA; [Buss, Daniel F.] Fundacao Oswaldo Cruz, Inst Oswaldo Cruz, Lab Avaliacao & Promocao Saude Ambiental, Rio De Janeiro, Brazil","Schneider, MC (reprint author), Pan Amer Hlth Org, Dept Communicable Dis & Hlth Anal, Washington, DC 20037 USA.",schneidc@paho.org,"Machado, Gustavo/F-1009-2010; OLIVEIRA RODRIGUES, ROGERIO/D-3260-2018; Rodrigues, Rogerio/D-7009-2019","Machado, Gustavo/0000-0001-7552-6144; OLIVEIRA RODRIGUES, ROGERIO/0000-0002-5289-4662; Corbellini, Luis Gustavo/0000-0003-3255-6321","CNPq, Brazil","GM received a scholarship from CNPq, Brazil.

In 2011-2012, an outbreak of P. vivax malaria was reported in Evrotas, an agricultural area in Southern Greece, where a large number of immigrants from endemic countries live and work. A total of 46 locally acquired and 38 imported malaria cases were detected. Despite a significant decrease of the number of malaria cases in 2012, a mass drug administration (MDA) program was considered as an additional measure to prevent reestablishment of the disease in the area. During 2013 and 2014, a combination of 3-day chloroquine and 14-day primaquine treatment was administered under direct observation to immigrants living in the epicenter of the 2011 outbreak in Evrotas. Adverse events were managed and recorded on a daily basis. The control measures implemented since 2011 continued during the period of 2013-2014 as a part of a national integrated malaria control program that included active case detection (ACD), vector control measures and community education. The MDA program was started prior to the transmission periods (from May to December). One thousand ninety four (1094) immigrants successfully completed the treatment, corresponding to 87.3% coverage of the target population. A total of 688 adverse events were recorded in 397 (36.2%, 95% C. I.: 33.4-39.1) persons, the vast majority minor, predominantly dizziness and headache for chloroquine (284 events) and abdominal pain (85 events) for primaquine. A single case of primaquine-induced hemolysis was recorded in a person whose initial G6PD test proved incorrect. No malaria cases were recorded in Evrotas, Laconia, in 2013 and 2014, though three locally acquired malaria cases were recorded in other regions of Greece in 2013. Preventive antimalarial MDA to a high-risk population in a low transmission setting appears to have synergized with the usual antimalarial activities to achieve malaria elimination. This study suggests that judicious use of MDA can be a useful addition to the antimalarial armamentarium in areas threatened with the reintroduction of the disease.","[Tseroni, Maria; Kapizioni, Christina; Charvalakou, Maria; Georgitsou, Maria; Panoutsakou, Maria; Psinaki, Ioanna; Tsoromokou, Maria; Karakitsos, George; Mouchtouri, Varvara; Hadjichristodoulou, Christos] Univ Thessaly, Fac Med, Dept Hyg & Epidemiol, Larisa, Greece; [Tseroni, Maria; Baka, Agoritsa; Tsiodras, Sotirios; Pervanidou, Danai; Vakali, Annita; Georgakopoulou, Theano; Kremastinou, Jenny] Hellen Ctr Dis Control & Prevent, Athens, Greece; [Snounou, Georges] Univ Paris 04, Paris, France; [Snounou, Georges] CNRS, INSERM, Ctr Immunol & Malad Infect CIMI Paris, Paris, France; [Mamuris, Zissis] Univ Thessaly, Dept Biochem & Biotechnol, Larisa, Greece; [Papadopoulos, Nikos] Univ Thessaly, Dept Agr Crop Prod & Rural Environm, Sch Agr Sci, Lab Entomol & Agr Zool, Volos, Greece; [Koliopoulos, George; Badieritakis, Evangelos] Benaki Phytopathol Inst, Athens, Greece; [Diamantopoulos, Vasilis] Municipal Evrotas, Laconia Reg Unit, Tripoli, Greece; [Tsakris, Athanasios] Univ Athens, Fac Med, Dept Microbiol, Athens 11528, Greece","Tseroni, M (reprint author), Univ Thessaly, Fac Med, Dept Hyg & Epidemiol, Larisa, Greece.",xhatzi@med.uth.gr,"Ucar, Abdullah/P-8329-2017","Tsiodras, Sotirios/0000-0002-0463-4321",Greece and the European Union-European Regional Development Fund; Integrated Surveillance and control programme for West Nile Virus and malaria in Greece (MALWEST Project) [MIS 365280],"The data collected in the context of ""Integrated Surveillance and control programme for West Nile Virus and malaria in Greece MIS 365280 (MALWEST Project)"" (http://www.malwest.gr/) which is implemented through the Operational Programme entitled ""Human Resources Development"" of National Strategic Reference Framework"" (NSRF) 2007-2013.

We evaluated fluorescent thin layer chromatography (f-TLC) for detection of mycolactone in the laboratory using samples from patients with Buruli ulcer and patients with similar lesions that gave a negative result on PCR for the IS2404 repeat sequence of M. ulcerans Methodology/Principal findings Mycolactone and DNA extracts from fine needle aspiration (FNA), swabs and biopsy specimen were used to determine the sensitivity and specificity of f-TLC when compared with PCR for the IS2404. For 71 IS2404 PCR positive and 28 PCR negative samples the sensitivity was 73.2% and specificity of 85.7% for f-TLC. The sensitivity was similar for swabs (73%), FNAs (75%) and biopsies (70%). Conclusions We have shown that mycolactone can be detected from M. ulcerans infected skin tissue by f-TLC technique. The technique is simple, easy to perform and read with minimal costs. In this study it was undertaken by a member of the group from each endemic country.

Rabies was laboratory-confirmed in 70 animals (9%) and an additional 36 cases were identified based on clinical diagnosis (5%), representing an 18-fold increase in reporting of rabid animals compared to the three years before the program was implemented. Dogs were the most frequent rabid animal (90%). Testing and observation ruled out rabies in 61% of animals investigated. A total of 639 bite victims were reported to the program and an additional 364 bite victims who had not sought medical care were identified during the course of investigations. Only 31% of people with likely rabies exposures had initiated rabies post-exposure prophylaxis prior to the investigation. Rabies is a neglected disease in-part due to a lack of surveillance and understanding about the burden. The surveillance methods employed by this program established a much higher burden of canine rabies in Haiti than previously recognized. The active, community-based bite investigations identified numerous additional rabies exposures and bite victims were referred for appropriate medical care, averting potential human rabies deaths. The use of community-based rabies surveillance programs such as HARSP should be considered in canine rabies endemic countries.","[Wallace, Ryan M.; Reses, Hannah; Franka, Richard; Orciari, Lillian; Blanton, Jesse D.] US Ctr Dis Control & Prevent, Poxvirus & Rabies Branch, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA; [Dilius, Pierre; Francisco, Calvin; Ludder, Fleurinord; Haim, Joseph; Millien, Max] Minist Agr Resources Nat & Dev Rural, Dept Anim Hlth, Port Au Prince, Haiti; [Fenelon, Natael; Destine, Apollon] Minist Sante Publ & Populat, Dept Epidemiol & Lab Res, Port Au Prince, Haiti; [Etheart, Melissa] US Ctr Dis Control & Prevent, Haiti Off, Port Au Prince, Haiti; [Crowdis, Kelly] Christian Vet Mission, Port Au Prince, Haiti; [Vilas, Victor Del Rio] Pan Amer Hlth Org, Pan Amer Foot & Mouth Dis Ctr, Rio De Janeiro, Brazil","Wallace, RM (reprint author), US Ctr Dis Control & Prevent, Poxvirus & Rabies Branch, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA.",euk5@cdc.gov,"MILLIEN, Max F./V-6088-2019","Blanton, Jesse/0000-0002-2634-355X; del rio vilas, victor/0000-0002-1674-9951",Haiti Animal Rabies Surveillance System,"The authors would like to acknowledge the many people who played integral roles in the development and support of the Haiti Animal Rabies Surveillance System:; Inger Damon, Mary Reynolds, Darin Carroll, Pam Yager, Ashutosh Wadhwa, James Ellison, Terquana Sanders, Jessie Dyer, Elsie Simmons, Sergio Recuenco, Michael Niezgoda, Brian Wheeler, Kitty Middleton, Roopal Patel, David Lowrance, Zara Ahmed, Rob Burris, the US Embassy Carpool and Stephanie Salyer-US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; Joceline Pierre-Louis, Jacques Boncy, Paul Adrien-Ministere de la Sante Publique et de la Population; Marco Vigilato and Jean Marie Rwangabwoba-Pan American Health Association.

The genus Leptospira includes at least 21 species clustered into three groups-pathogens, non-pathogens, and intermediates-based on 16S rRNA phylogeny. Research on Leptospira is difficult due to slow growth and poor transformability of the pathogens. Recent identification of extrachromosomal elements besides the two chromosomes in L. interrogans has provided new insight into genome complexity of the genus Leptospira. The large size, low copy number, and high similarity of the sequence of these extrachromosomal elements with the chromosomes present challenges in isolating and detecting them without careful genome assembly. In this study, two extrachromosomal elements were identified in L. borgpetersenii serovar Ballum strain 56604 through whole genome assembly combined with S1 nuclease digestion following pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (S1-PFGE) analysis. Further, extrachromosomal elements in additional 15 Chinese epidemic strains of Leptospira, comprising L. borgpetersenii, L. weilii, and L. interrogans, were successfully separated and identified, independent of genome sequence data. Southern blot hybridization with extrachromosomal element-specific probes, designated as lcp1, lcp2 and lcp3-rep, further confirmed their occurrences as extrachromosomal elements. In total, 24 plasmids were detected in 13 out of 15 tested strains, among which 11 can hybridize with the lcp1-rep probe and 11 with the lcp2-rep probe, whereas two can hybridize with the lcp3-rep probe. None of them are likely to be species-specific. Blastp search of the lcp1, lcp2, and lcp3-rep genes with a nonredundant protein database of Leptospira species genomes showed that their homologous sequences are widely distributed among clades of pathogens but not non-pathogens or intermediates. These results suggest that the plasmids are widely distributed in Leptospira species, and further elucidation of their biological significance might contribute to our understanding of biology and infectivity of pathogenic spirochetes.","[Wang, Yanzhuo; Zhuang, Xuran; Zhang, Yan; Zhu, Yongzhang; He, Ping; Dong, Ke; Guo, Xiaokui; Qin, Jinhong] Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Sch Med, Inst Med Sci, Dept Microbiol & Immunol, Shanghai 200030, Peoples R China; [Zhong, Yi] Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, Computat Biol Dept, New York, NY 10021 USA; [Zhang, Cuicai] Chinese Ctr Dis Control & Prevent ICDC, CCDC, Natl Inst Communicable Dis Control & Prevent, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Zeng, Lingbing] Nanchang Univ, Affiliated Hosp 1, Nanchang, Peoples R China; [Pal, Utpal] Univ Maryland, Dept Vet Med, College Pk & Virginia Maryland Reg Coll Vet Med, College Pk, MD 20742 USA","Wang, YZ (reprint author), Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Sch Med, Inst Med Sci, Dept Microbiol & Immunol, Shanghai 200030, Peoples R China.",upal@umd.edu; xkguo@shsmu.edu.cn; jinhongqin@sjtu.edu.cn,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China [81261160321, 81171587, 81271793, 81201334, 81471908]; Research Fund for the Doctoral Program of Higher Education of China [201200731100719]; Natural Science Foundation of Shanghai [13ZR1423000]","This work was supported by grants: the National Natural Science Foundation of China (grant numbers 81261160321, 81171587, 81271793, 81201334, 81471908) to XG, KD and PH; http://www.nsfc.gov.cn/; Research Fund for the Doctoral Program of Higher Education of China (grant number 201200731100719) to XG; http://www.cutech.edu.cn/; the Natural Science Foundation of Shanghai (grant number 13ZR1423000) to PH; http://www.stcsm.gov.cn/.

In areas highly endemic for loaisis in DRC and Cameroon, a relationship has been envisaged between high L. loa microfilaria (Mf) loads and ICT positivity. However, similar associations have not been demonstrated from other areas with contrasting levels of L. loa endemicity. This study investigated the cross-reactivity of ICT when mapping lymphatic filariasis (LF) in areas with contrasting endemicity levels of loiasis and mansonellosis in Cameroon. Methodology/Principal Findings A cross-sectional study to assess the prevalence and intensity of W. bancrofti, L. loa and M. perstans was carried out in 42 villages across three regions (East, North-west and Southwest) of the Cameroon rainforest domain. Diurnal blood was collected from participants for the detection of circulating filarial antigen (CFA) by ICT and assessment of Mf using a thick blood smear. Clinical manifestations of LF were also assessed. ICT positives and patients clinically diagnosed with lymphoedema were further subjected to night blood collection for the detection ofW. bancrofti Mf. Overall, 2190 individuals took part in the study. Overall, 24 individuals residing in 14 communities were tested positive by ICT, with prevalence rates ranging from 0% in the South-west to 2.1% in the North-west. Lymphoedema were diagnosed in 20 individuals with the majority of cases found in the North-west (11/20), and none of them were tested positive by ICT. No Mf of W. bancrofti were found in the night blood of any individual with a positive ICT result or clinical lymphoedema. Positive ICT results were strongly associated with high L. loa Mf intensity with 21 subjects having more than 8,000 L. loa Mf ml/blood (Odds ratio = 15.4; 95% CI: 6.1-39.0; p < 0.001). Similarly, a strong positive association (Spearman's rho = 0.900; p = 0.037) was observed between the prevalence of L. loa and ICT positivity by area: a rate of 1% or more of positive ICT results was found only in areas with an L. loa Mf prevalence above 15%. In contrast, there was no association between ICT positivity and M. perstans prevalence (Spearman's rho = -0.200; p = 0.747) and Mf density (Odds ratio = 1.8; 95% CI: 0.8-4.2; p = 0.192). Conclusions/Significance This study has confirmed the strong association between the ICT positivity and L. loa intensity (Mf/ml of blood) at the individual level. Furthermore, the study has demonstrated that ICT positivity is strongly associated with high L. loa prevalence. These results suggest that the main confounding factor for positive ICT test card results are high levels of L. loa. The findings may indicate that W. bancrofti is much less prevalent in the Central African region where L. loa is highly endemic than previously assumed and accuratere-mapping of the region would be very useful for shrinking of the map of LF distribution.","[Wanji, Samuel; Njouendou, Abdel Jelil; Ndongmo, Patrick W.

An experimental model of this condition would greatly aid the definition of the optimal management of this important clinical presentation. Methodology/Principle Findings Fifteen baboons (Papio anubis) were infected with 600 infective larvae (L3) isolated from Chrysops vector flies. Animals were observed for any clinical changes; blood samples were collected every 1-2 months for 22 months, and analysed for parasitological, hematological and biochemical profiles using standard techniques. All animals became patent but remained clinically normal throughout the study. The parasitological pre-patent period was between 4-8 months, with a majority (60%) of animals becoming patent by 5 months post infection (MPI); all animals were patent by 8 MPI. Microfilarial loads increased steadily in all animals and reached a peak at 18 MPI. By 10 MPI > 70% of animals had mf > 8,000 mf/mL, and at 18 MPI > 70% of animals had mf > 30,000mf/mL with 50% of these animals with mf > 50,000mf/ mL. Absolute eosinophil, creatinine, Ca2+ and K+ levels were generally above normal values (NV). Positive associations were seen between microfilariaemia and eosinophilia, Hb, Ca2+, and gamma-GT values, whilst significant negative associations were seen between microfilariaemia and potassium, glucose and mononuclear leukocyte levels. Conclusions Infection of splenectomised baboons with L. loa can induce levels of circulating microfilariae, and corresponding haematological profiles, which parallel those seen in those humans in danger of the severe post-microfilariacide clinical responses. Utilization of this experimental model could contribute to the improved management of the loiasis related adverse responses in humans.","[Wanji, Samuel; Tendongfor, Nicholas; Kengne-Ouafo, Arnaud; Datchoua-Poutcheu, Fabrice; Enyong, Peter] Univ Buea, Fac Sci, Dept Microbiol & Parasitol, Parasites & Vectors Res Unit, South West Region, Cameroon; [Wanji, Samuel; Eyong, Ebanga-Echi; Tendongfor, Nicholas; Ngwa, Che; Esuka, Elive; Kengne-Ouafo, Arnaud; Datchoua-Poutcheu, Fabrice; Enyong, Peter] Res Fdn Trop Dis & Environm REFOTDE, South West Region, Cameroon; [Eyong, Ebanga-Echi] Univ Bamenda, Dept Biol Sci, Fac Sci, North West Region, Cameroon; [Eyong, Ebanga-Echi] Univ Buea, Dept Zool & Anim Physiol, Fac Sci, South West Region, Cameroon; [Hopkins, Adrian] Mectizan Donat Programme, Decatur, GA USA; [Mackenzie, Charles D.] Michigan State Univ, Dept Pathobiol & Diagnost Invest, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA","Wanji, S (reprint author), Univ Buea, Fac Sci, Dept Microbiol & Parasitol, Parasites & Vectors Res Unit, South West Region, Cameroon.",swanji@yahoo.fr,,,Merck Co.

Methodology/Principal Findings To better understand the genetic relationships between earlier and more recent circulating strains, patterns of virus movement, as well as the molecular basis of MVEV evolution, complete pre-membrane (prM) and Envelope (Env) genes were sequenced from sixty-six MVEV strains from different regions of the Australasian region, isolated over a sixty year period (1951-2011). Phylogenetic analyses indicated that, of the four recognized genotypes, only G1 and G2 are contemporary. G1 viruses were dominant over the sampling period and found across the known geographic range of MVEV. Two distinct sub-lineages of G1 were observed (1A and 1B). Although G1B strains have been isolated from across mainland Australia, Australian G1A strains have not been detected outside northwest Australia. Similarly, G2 is comprised of only Western Australian isolates from mosquitoes, suggesting G1B and G2 viruses have geographic or ecological restrictions. No evidence of recombination was found and a single amino acid substitution in the Env protein (S332G) was found to be under positive selection, while several others were found to be under directional evolution. Evolutionary analyses indicated that extant genotypes of MVEV began to diverge from a common ancestor approximately 200 years ago. G2 was the first genotype to diverge, followed by G3 and G4, and finally G1, from which subtypes G1A and G1B diverged between 1964 and 1994. Conclusions/Significance The results of this study provides new insights into the genetic diversity and evolution of MVEV. The demonstration of co-circulation of all contemporary genetic lineages of MVEV in northwestern Australia, supports the contention that this region is the enzootic focus for this virus.","[Williams, David T.; Durr, Peter A.] CSIRO, Australian Anim Hlth Lab, Geelong, Vic, Australia; [Diviney, Sinead M.; Niazi, Aziz-ur-Rahman; Mackenzie, John S.] Curtin Univ, Fac Hlth Sci, Perth, WA 6845, Australia; [Chua, Beng Hooi] Curtin Univ, Off Res & Dev, Perth, WA 6845, Australia; [Herring, Belinda] Univ Sydney, Infect Dis & Immunol, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia; [Pyke, Alyssa] Queensland Hlth Forens & Sci Serv, Publ Hlth Virol, Coopers Plains, Qld, Australia; [Doggett, Stephen L.] Univ Sydney, Dept Med Entomol, Westmead Hosp, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia; [Doggett, Stephen L.] Inst Clin Pathol & Med Res, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Johansen, Cheryl A.] Univ Western Australia, Arbovirus Surveillance & Res Lab, Sch Pathol & Lab Med, Perth, WA 6009, Australia","Williams, DT (reprint author), CSIRO, Australian Anim Hlth Lab, Geelong, Vic, Australia.",d.williams@csiro.au; sinead.diviney@googlemail.com,"Durr, Peter/O-2948-2014; Williams, David T/H-6750-2013; /S-4986-2019; Johansen, Cheryl/A-2208-2009; Williams, Sinead M/P-7694-2018","Durr, Peter/0000-0003-0851-5300; Williams, David T/0000-0002-7169-149X; /0000-0002-5918-2190; Williams, Sinead M/0000-0003-2011-5289; Pyke, Alyssa/0000-0003-3512-4321",Curtin University of Technology Internal Research Scheme; Western Australia Premier's Research Fellowship; Western Australian Department of Health; NSW Ministry of Health,"DTW received funding from the Curtin University of Technology Internal Research Scheme (www.curtin.edu.au); AuRN received an Australian Biosecurity Cooperative Research Centre PhD Scholarship (http://trove.nla.gov.au/people/1471363?c=people; JSM recieved funding from the Western Australia Premier's Research Fellowship (https://www.dpc.wa.gov.au/science/FundingPrograms/Pages/WAFellowshipsProgram.aspx); CAJ received funding from the Western Australian Department of Health (ww2.health.wa.gov.au); SLD was funded by the NSW Ministry of Health (www.health.nsw.gov.au).

Methods We conducted a retrospective analysis of data collected in Esmeraldas (Ecuador) during surveys conducted in areas where ivermectin was annually administered to the entire population for the control of onchocerciasis. Data from 5 surveys, conducted between 1990 (before the start of the distribution of ivermectin) and 2013 (six years after the interruption of the intervention) were analyzed. The surveys also comprised areas where ivermectin was not distributed because onchocerciasis was not endemic. Different laboratory techniques were used in the different surveys (direct fecal smear, formol-ether concentration, IFAT and IVD ELISA for Strongyloides stercoralis). Results In the areas where ivermectin was distributed the strongyloidiasis prevalence fell from 6.8% in 1990 to zero in 1996 and 1999. In 2013 prevalence in children was zero with stool examination and 1.3% with serology, in adult 0.7% and 2.7%. In areas not covered by ivermectin distribution the prevalence was 23.5% and 16.1% in 1996 and 1999, respectively. In 2013 the prevalence was 0.6% with fecal exam and 9.3% with serology in children and 2.3% and 17.9% in adults. Regarding other soil transmitted helminthiases: in areas where ivermectin was distributed the prevalence of T. trichiura was significantly reduced, while A. lumbricoides and hookworms were seemingly unaffected.

Rabies elimination can be achieved through the mass vaccination of dogs, but maintaining the critical threshold of vaccination coverage for herd immunity in these populations is hampered by their rapid turnover. Knowledge of the population dynamics of free-roaming dog populations can inform effective planning and implementation of mass dog vaccination campaigns to control rabies. Methodology/Principal Findings We implemented a health and demographic surveillance system in dogs that monitored the entire owned dog population within a defined geographic area in a community in Mpumalanga Province, South Africa. We quantified demographic rates over a 24-month period, from 1st January 2012 through 1st January 2014, and assessed their implications for rabies control by simulating the decline in vaccination coverage over time. During this period, the population declined by 10%. Annual population growth rates were + 18.6% in 2012 and -24.5% in 2013. Crude annual birth rates (per 1,000 dog-years of observation) were 451 in 2012 and 313 in 2013. Crude annual death rates were 406 in 2012 and 568 in 2013. Females suffered a significantly higher mortality rate in 2013 than males (mortality rate ratio [MRR] = 1.54, 95% CI = 1.28-1.85). In the age class 0-3 months, the mortality rate of dogs vaccinated against rabies was significantly lower than that of unvaccinated dogs (2012: MRR = 0.11, 95% CI = 0.05-0.21; 2013: MRR = 0.31, 95% CI = 0.11-0.69). The results of the simulation showed that achieving a 70% vaccination coverage during annual campaigns would maintain coverage above the critical threshold for at least 12 months. Conclusions and Significance Our findings provide an evidence base for the World Health Organization's empirically-derived target of 70% vaccination coverage during annual campaigns. Achieving this will be effective even in highly dynamic populations with extremely high growth rates and rapid turnover. This increases confidence in the feasibility of dog rabies elimination in Africa through mass vaccination.","[Conan, Anne; van Rooyen, Jacques] Univ Pretoria, Fac Vet Sci, Dept Vet Trop Dis, ZA-0002 Pretoria, South Africa; [Akerele, Oluyemisi] Gauteng Dept Agr & Rural Dev, Gauteng, South Africa; [Simpson, Greg] Univ Pretoria, Fac Vet Studies, Ctr Vet Wildlife Studies, ZA-0002 Pretoria, South Africa; [Reininghaus, Bjorn] Mpumalanga Vet Serv, Dept Agr Rural Dev Land & Environm Affairs, Thulamahashe, South Africa; [Conan, Anne; Knobel, Darryn] Ross Univ, Sch Vet Med, Ctr Conservat Med & Ecosyst Hlth, Basseterre, St Kitts & Nevi","Conan, A (reprint author), Ross Univ, Sch Vet Med, Ctr Conservat Med & Ecosyst Hlth, Basseterre, St Kitts & Nevi.",dknobel@rossvet.edu.kn,"Knobel, Darryn/O-7057-2014","Knobel, Darryn/0000-0002-0425-3799; Simpson, Gregory/0000-0001-8089-7193",Morris Animal Foundation [D12CA-312],"This study was funded by a First Investigator Award to DK (grant no.

Current diagnostic and surveillance systems in much of sub-Saharan Africa are not designed to identify or report non-Pf human malaria infections accurately, resulting in a dearth of routine epidemiological data about their significance. The high prevalence of Duffy negativity provided a rationale for excluding the possibility of Plasmodium vivax (Pv) transmission. However, review of varied evidence sources including traveller infections, community prevalence surveys, local clinical case reports, entomological and serological studies contradicts this viewpoint. Here, these data reports are weighted in a unified framework to reflect the strength of evidence of indigenous Pv transmission in terms of diagnostic specificity, size of individual reports and corroboration between evidence sources. Direct evidence was reported from 21 of the 47 malaria-endemic countries studied, while 42 countries were attributed with infections of visiting travellers. Overall, moderate to conclusive evidence of transmission was available from 18 countries, distributed across all parts of the continent. Approximately 86.6 million Duffy positive hosts were at risk of infection in Africa in 2015. Analysis of the mechanisms sustaining Pv transmission across this continent of low frequency of susceptible hosts found that reports of Pv prevalence were consistent with transmission being potentially limited to Duffy positive populations. Finally, reports of apparent Duffy-independent transmission are discussed. While Pv is evidently not a major malaria parasite across most of sub-Saharan Africa, the evidence presented here highlights its widespread low-level endemicity. An increased awareness of Pv as a potential malaria parasite, coupled with policy shifts towards species-specific diagnostics and reporting, will allow a robust assessment of the public health significance of Pv, as well as the other neglected non-Pf parasites, which are currently invisible to most public health authorities in Africa, but which can cause severe clinical illness and require specific control interventions.","[Howes, Rosalind E.; Battle, Katherine E.; Mappin, Bonnie; Gething, Peter W.; Smith, David L.] Univ Oxford, Dept Zool, Spatial Ecol & Epidemiol Grp, Oxford, England; [Howes, Rosalind E.; Zimmerman, Peter A.] Case Western Reserve Univ, Ctr Global Hlth & Dis, Cleveland, OH 44106 USA; [Reiner, Robert C., Jr.] Indiana Univ, Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Epidemiol & Biostat, Bloomington, IN USA; [Reiner, Robert C., Jr.; Tatem, Andrew J.; Smith, David L.; Hay, Simon I.] NIH, Fogarty Int Ctr, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; [Longbottom, Joshua; Hay, Simon I.] Univ Oxford, Wellcome Trust Ctr Human Genet, Oxford, England; [Ordanovich, Dariya; Tatem, Andrew J.] Univ Southampton, Dept Geog & Environm, Southampton, Hants, England; [Tatem, Andrew J.] Flowminder Fdn, Stockholm, Sweden; [Drakeley, Chris] London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, Malaria Ctr, London WC1, England; [Smith, David L.] Sanaria Inst Global Hlth & Trop Med, Rockville, MD USA; [Smith, David L.; Hay, Simon I.] Univ Washington, Inst Hlth Metr & Evaluat, Seattle, WA 98195 USA","Howes, RE (reprint author), Univ Oxford, Dept Zool, Spatial Ecol & Epidemiol Grp, S Parks Rd, Oxford, England.",rosalind.howes@zoo.ox.ac.uk,"Menard, Didier/O-3294-2013; Hay, Simon I/F-8967-2015; Smith, David/L-8850-2013","Menard, Didier/0000-0003-1357-4495; Hay, Simon I/0000-0002-0611-7272; Smith, David/0000-0003-4367-3849; Longbottom, Joshua/0000-0002-4151-9031; Gething, Peter/0000-0001-6759-5449; Zimmerman, Peter/0000-0002-5349-4513; Battle, Katherine/0000-0003-2401-2615","Wellcome Trust [095066, 091924]; NIH [R01 AI097366]; Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation [OPP1106427, 1032350, OPP1068048, OPP1106023, OPP1110495]; UK Medical Research Council (MRC) [K00669X]; UK Department for International Development (DFID) [K00669X]; RAPIDD program of the Science & Technology Directorate, Department of Homeland Security; Fogarty International Center, National Institutes of Health, USA","REH is funded by a Wellcome Trust (www.wellcome.ac.uk) Senior Research Fellowship to SIH (095066) and an NIH (www.nih.gov) grant to PAZ (R01 AI097366).

A peculiar feature of chronic CE is the coexistence of Th1 and Th2 responses. It has been suggested that Th1 cytokines are related to disease resistance, whereas Th2 cytokines are related to disease susceptibility and chronicity. The aim of this study was to evaluate, by multi-parametric flow cytometry (FACS), the presence of CE specific immune signatures. Methodology/Principal Findings We enrolled 54 subjects with suspected CE; 42 of them had a confirmed diagnosis, whereas 12 were classified as NO-CE. Based on the ultrasonography images, CE patients were further categorized as being in ""active stages"" (25) and ""inactive stages"" (17). The ability of CD4(+) T-cells to produce IFN-gamma, IL-2, TNF-alpha, Th2 cytokines or IL-10 was assessed by FACS on antigen-specific T-cells after overnight stimulation with Antigen B (AgB) of E. granulosus. Cytokine profiles were evaluated in all the enrolled subjects. The results show that none of the NO-CE subjects had a detectable AgB-specific response. Among the CE patients, the frequency and proportions of AgB-specific CD4(+) T-cells producing IL-2(+) TNF-alpha(+)Th2(+) or TNF-alpha(+)Th2(+) were significantly increased in the ""active stages"" group compared to the "" inactive stages"" group. Moreover, an increased proportion of the total polyfunctional subsets, as triple-and double-functional CD4 T-cells, was found in CE patients with active disease. The response to the mitogen, used as a control stimulus to evaluate the immune competence status, was characterized by the same cytokine subsets in all the subjects enrolled, independent of CE. Conclusions We demonstrate, for the first time to our knowledge, that polyfunctional T-cell subsets as IL-2(+) TNF-alpha(+) Th2(+) triple- positive and TNF-alpha(+) Th2(+) double-positive specific T-cells associate with cyst biological activity. These results contribute to increase knowledge of CE immunophatogenesis and the disease outcome in terms of control and persistence.","[Petrone, Linda; Vanini, Valentina; Petruccioli, Elisa; Goletti, Delia] L Spallanzani Natl Inst Infect Dis INMI, Dept Epidemiol & Preclin Res, Translat Res Unit, Rome, Italy; [Ettorre, Giuseppe Maria] Polo Osped Interaziendale San Camillo INMI Lazzar, POIT, Surg Unit, Rome, Italy; [Ettorre, Giuseppe Maria] Polo Osped Interaziendale San Camillo INMI Lazzar, POIT, Transplantat Interaziendale Dept, Rome, Italy; [Schinina, Vincenzo; Rizzi, Elisa Busi] IRCCS, L Spallanzani Natl Inst Infect Dis INMI, Dept Radiol, Rome, Italy; [Ludovisi, Alessandra; Pozio, Edoardo] IRCCS, Ist Super Sanita, Dept Infect Parasit & Immunomediated Dis, Rome, Italy; [Corpolongo, Angela] IRCCS, Natl Inst Infect Dis INMI, Clin Dept, Rome, Italy; [Ippolito, Giuseppe] IRCCS, Natl Inst Infect Dis INMI, Sci Direct, Rome, Italy; [Teggi, Antonella] Univ Roma La Sapienza, St Andrea Hosp, Dept Infect & Trop Dis, Rome, Italy","Petrone, L (reprint author), L Spallanzani Natl Inst Infect Dis INMI, Dept Epidemiol & Preclin Res, Translat Res Unit, Rome, Italy.",delia.goletti@inmi.it,"Ippolito, Giuseppe/J-7207-2017; Vanini, Valentina/K-4475-2016","Vanini, Valentina/0000-0001-8476-964X; Ippolito, Giuseppe/0000-0002-1076-2979; Ettorre, Giuseppe Maria/0000-0002-7501-5472","European Community [HEALTH-F3-2009-241642]; Italian Ministry of Health (Linea 1, Ricerca Corrente)","The study was supported by grants from the European Community (HEALTH-F3-2009-241642) and the Italian Ministry of Health (Linea 1, Ricerca Corrente).

Two communities in each woreda were purposely selected using the World Health Organization (WHO) mapping strategy for LF based on sampling 100 individuals per community and two purposely selected communities per woreda. Overall, 130 166 people were examined in 1315 communities in 658 woredas. In total, 140 people were found to be positive for circulating LF antigen by immunochromatographic card test (ICT) in 89 communities. Based on WHO guidelines, 75 of the 658 woredas surveyed in the nine regions were found to be endemic for LF with a 2016 projected population of 9 267 410 residing in areas of active disease transmission. Combining these results with other data it is estimated that 11 580 010 people in 112 woredas will be exposed to infection in 2016. Conclusions We have conducted nationwide mapping of LF in Ethiopia and demonstrated that the number of people living in LF endemic areas is 60% lower than current estimates. We also showed that integrated mapping of multiple NTDs is feasible and cost effective and if properly planned, can be quickly achieved at national scale.","[Rebollo, Maria P.; Bockarie, Moses J.] Univ Liverpool, Liverpool Sch Trop Med, Dept Parasitol, Ctr Neglected Trop Dis, Liverpool L3 5QA, Merseyside, England; [Sime, Heven; Assefa, Ashenafi; Kebede, Amha] Ethiopian Publ Hlth Inst, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia; [Cano, Jorge; Brooker, Simon J.] London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, London WC1, England; [Deribe, Kebede; Davey, Gail] Brighton & Sussex Med Sch, Brighton, E Sussex, England; [Deribe, Kebede] Univ Addis Ababa, Sch Publ Hlth, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia; [Gonzalez-Escalada, Alba] Rey Juan Carlos Univ, Fac Infect & Trop Dis, Madrid, Spain; [Shafi, Oumer] Fed Minist Hlth, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia","Rebollo, MP (reprint author), Task Force Global Hlth, Neglected Trop Dis Support Ctr, Decatur, GA 30030 USA.",moses.bockarie@lstmed.ac.uk,"Deribe, Kebede/K-7055-2019; Deribe, Kebede/I-5422-2019; Cano, Jorge/E-2962-2016","Deribe, Kebede/0000-0002-8526-6996; Cano, Jorge/0000-0001-9864-5058",DFID; End Fund; Wellcome Trust; Medical Research Council [G1001337],"This study was supported by funding from DFID, End Fund and Wellcome Trust.

At initial presentation, it is difficult to distinguish chikungunya fever (CHIKF) from other acute undifferentiated febrile illnesses (AUFIs), including life-threatening dengue disease. We characterised and compared dengue virus (DENV) and CHIKV infections in 158 patients presenting with suspected dengue fever (DF) and CHIKF at a major hospital in T&T, and performed phylogenetic analyses on CHIKV genomic sequences recovered from 8 individuals. The characteristics of patients with and without PCR-confirmed CHIKV were compared using Pearson's chi(2) and student's t-tests, and adjusted odds ratios (aORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were determined using logistic regression. We then compared signs and symptoms of people with RT-qPCR-confirmed CHIKV and DENV infections using the Mann-Whitney U, Pearson's chi(2) and Fisher's exact tests. Among the 158 persons there were 8 (6%) RT-qPCR-confirmed DENV and 30 (22%) RT-qPCR-confirmed CHIKV infections. Phylogenetic analyses showed that the CHIKV strains belonged to the Asian genotype and were most closely related to a British Virgin Islands strain isolated at the beginning of the 2013/14 outbreak in the Americas. Compared to persons who were RT-qPCR-negative for CHIKV, RT-qPCR-positive individuals were significantly more likely to have joint pain (aOR: 4.52 [95% CI: 1.28-16.00]), less likely to be interviewed at a later stage of illness (days post onset of fever-aOR: 0.56 [0.40-0.78]) and had a lower white blood cell count (aOR: 0.83 [0.71-0.96]). Among the 38 patients with RT-qPCR-confirmed CHIKV or DENV, there were no significant differences in symptomatic presentation. However when individuals with serological evidence of recent DENV or CHIKV infection were included in the analyses, there were key differences in clinical presentation between CHIKF and other AUFIs including DF, which can be used to triage patients for appropriate care in the clinical setting.","[Sahadeo, Nikita; Allicock, Orchid M.; Badal, Kimberly; Foster, Jerome E.; Carrington, Christine V.

Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the multidrug resistance gene, Pvmdr1 are putative determinants of CQR but the extent of their emergence at population level remains to be explored. Objective In this study we describe the prevalence of SNPs in the Pvmdr1 among samples collected in seven P. vivax endemic countries and we looked for molecular evidence of drug selection by characterising polymorphism at microsatellite (MS) loci flanking the Pvmdr1 gene. Methods We examined the prevalence of SNPs in the Pvmdr1 gene among 267 samples collected from Pakistan, Afghanistan, Sri Lanka, Nepal, Sudan, Sao Tome and Ecuador. We measured and diversity in four microsatellite (MS) markers flanking the Pvmdr1 gene to look evidence of selection on mutant alleles. Results SNP polymorphism in the Pvmdr1 gene was largely confined to codons T958M, Y976F and F1076L. Only 2.4% of samples were wildtype at all three codons (TYF, n = 5), 13.3% (n = 28) of the samples were single mutant MYF, 63.0% of samples (n = 133) were double mutant MYL, and 21.3%(n = 45) were triple mutant MFL. Clear geographic differences in the prevalence of these Pvmdr mutation combinations were observed. Significant linkage disequilibrium (LD) between Pvmdr1 and MS alleles was found in populations sampled in Ecuador, Nepal and Sri Lanka, while significant LD between Pvmdr1 and the combined 4 MS locus haplotype was only seen in Ecuador and Sri Lanka. When combining the 5 loci, high level diversity, measured as expected heterozygosity (He), was seen in the complete sample set (H-e = 0.99), while H-e estimates for individual loci ranged from 0.00-0.93. Although Pvmdr1 haplotypes were not consistently associated with specific flanking MS alleles, there was significant differentiation between geographic sites which could indicate directional selection through local drug pressure. Conclusions Our observations suggest that Pvmdr1 mutations emerged independently on multiple occasions even within the same population. In Sri Lanka population analysis at multiple sites showed evidence of local selection and geographical dispersal of Pvmdr1 mutations between sites.","[Schousboe, Mette L.; Ranjitkar, Samir; Alifrangis, Michael] Univ Copenhagen, Inst Microbiol & Immunol, Ctr Med Parasitol, Copenhagen, Denmark; [Schousboe, Mette L.; Ranjitkar, Samir; Alifrangis, Michael] Copenhagen Univ Hosp, Dept Infect Dis, Copenhagen, Denmark; [Rajakaruna, Rupika S.] Univ Peradeniya, Dept Zool, Peradeniya, Sri Lanka; [Amerasinghe, Priyanie H.] Int Water Management Inst, Hyderabad, Andhra Pradesh, India; [Morales, Francisco] Univ San Francisco Quito Robles & Pampite, Cumbaya, Ecuador; [Pearce, Richard; Leslie, Toby; Rowland, Mark; Roper, Cally] London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, Fac Infect & Trop Dis, London WC1, England; [Ord, Rosalyn] New York Blood Ctr, Lindsley F Kimball Res Inst, Blood Borne Parasites, New York, NY 10021 USA; [Gadalla, Nahla B.] NIAID, Lab Malaria & Vector Res, NIH, Rockville, MD USA; [Konradsen, Flemming; Bygbjerg, Ib C.] Univ Copenhagen, Inst Publ Hlth, Sect Global Hlth, Copenhagen, Denmark","Schousboe, ML (reprint author), Univ Copenhagen, Inst Microbiol & Immunol, Ctr Med Parasitol, Copenhagen, Denmark.",Cally.Roper@lshtm.ac.uk,,"Konradsen, Flemming/0000-0003-1036-6949; Alifrangis, Michael/0000-0002-3835-3333; Bygbjerg, Ib/0000-0001-9100-2754; Roper, Cally/0000-0002-6545-309X","Danish Agency for Science, Technology and Innovation","The study have received funding from the Danish Agency for Science, Technology and Innovation (MLS).

An area-wide integrated pest management campaign against Glossina palpalis gambiensis has been implemented in Senegal since 2010 that includes a sterile insect technique (SIT) component. The SIT can only be successful when the sterile males that are destined for release have a flight ability, survival and competitiveness that are as close as possible to that of their wild male counterparts. Methodology/Principal Findings Tests were developed to assess the quality of G.p. gambiensis males that emerged from pupae that were produced and irradiated in Burkina Faso and Slovakia (irradiation done in Seibersdorf, Austria) and transported weekly under chilled conditions to Dakar, Senegal. For each consignment a sample of 50 pupae was used for a quality control test (QC group). To assess flight ability, the pupae were put in a cylinder filtering emerged flies that were able to escape the cylinder. The survival of these flyers was thereafter monitored under stress conditions (without feeding). Remaining pupae were emerged and released in the target area of the eradication programme (RF group). The following parameter values were obtained for the QC flies: average emergence rate more than 69%, median survival of 6 days, and average flight ability of more than 35%. The quality protocol was a good proxy of fly quality, explaining a large part of the variances of the examined parameters. Conclusions/Significance The quality protocol described here will allow the accurate monitoring of the quality of shipped sterile male tsetse used in operational eradication programmes in the framework of the Pan-African Tsetse and Trypanosomosis Eradication Campaign.","[Seck, Momar Talla; Bassene, Mireille D.; Bouyer, Jeremy; Gimonneau, Geoffrey] Inst Senegalais Rech Agr, Lab Natl Elevage & Rech Vet, Serv Bioecol & Pathol Parasitaires, Dakar, Senegal; [Pagabeleguem, Soumaila; Sidibe, Issa] Pan African Tsetse & Trypanosomosis Eradicat Camp, Bobo Dioulasso, Burkina Faso; [Pagabeleguem, Soumaila; Bouyer, Jeremy; Gimonneau, Geoffrey] Ctr Cooperat Int Rech Agr Dev, Unite Mixte Rech Controle Malad Anim Exot & Emerg, Montpellier, France; [Pagabeleguem, Soumaila; Bouyer, Jeremy; Gimonneau, Geoffrey] INRA, Unit Mixte Rech Malad Anim Exot & Emergentes 1309, F-34060 Montpellier, France; [Sall, Baba] Direct Serv Vet, Dakar, Senegal; [Vreysen, Marc J.

Transmission is governed by the spatial distribution of specific freshwater snails that act as intermediate hosts and human water contact patterns. Remote sensing data have been utilized for spatially explicit risk profiling of schistosomiasis. We investigated the potential of remote sensing to characterize habitat conditions of parasite and intermediate host snails and discuss the relevance for public health. Methodology We employed high-resolution remote sensing data, environmental field measurements, and ecological data to model environmental suitability for schistosomiasis-related parasite and snail species. The model was developed for Burkina Faso using a habitat suitability index (HSI). The plausibility of remote sensing habitat variables was validated using field measurements. The established model was transferred to different ecological settings in Cote d'Ivoire and validated against readily available survey data from school-aged children. Principal Findings Environmental suitability for schistosomiasis transmission was spatially delineated and quantified by seven habitat variables derived from remote sensing data. The strengths and weaknesses highlighted by the plausibility analysis showed that temporal dynamic water and vegetation measures were particularly useful to model parasite and snail habitat suitability, whereas the measurement of water surface temperature and topographic variables did not perform appropriately. The transferability of the model showed significant relations between the HSI and infection prevalence in study sites of Cote d'Ivoire. Conclusions/Significance A predictive map of environmental suitability for schistosomiasis transmission can support measures to gain and sustain control. This is particularly relevant as emphasis is shifting from morbidity control to interrupting transmission. Further validation of our mechanistic model needs to be complemented by field data of parasite- and snail-related fitness. Our model provides a useful tool to monitor the development of new hotspots of potential schistosomiasis transmission based on regularly updated remote sensing data.","[Walz, Yvonne; Wegmann, Martin; Dech, Stefan] Univ Wurzburg, Inst Geog & Geol, Dept Remote Sensing, D-97070 Wurzburg, Germany; [Walz, Yvonne] United Nations Univ, Inst Environm & Human Secur, Bonn, Germany; [Dech, Stefan] German Aerosp Ctr, German Remote Sensing Data Ctr, Oberpfaffenhofen, Germany; [Vounatsou, Penelope; Utzinger, Juerg; Raso, Giovanna] Swiss Trop & Publ Hlth Inst, Dept Epidemiol & Publ Hlth, Basel, Switzerland; [Vounatsou, Penelope; Utzinger, Juerg; Raso, Giovanna] Univ Basel, Basel, Switzerland; [Poda, Jean-Noel] Inst Rech Sci Sante, Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso; [N'Goran, Ellezer K.] Univ Felix Houphouet Boigny, Unite Format & Rech Biosci, Abidjan, Cote Ivoire; [N'Goran, Ellezer K.] Ctr Suisse Rech Sci Cote dIvoire, Abidjan, Cote Ivoire","Walz, Y (reprint author), Univ Wurzburg, Inst Geog & Geol, Dept Remote Sensing, D-97070 Wurzburg, Germany.",yvonne.walz@uni-wuerzburg.de,,"Wegmann, Martin/0000-0003-0335-9601; Vounatsou, Penelope/0000-0002-4904-5352",Equal Opportunities for Women in Research and Training programme at the University of Wurzburg; German Research Foundation (DFG); University of Wuerzburg,"YW received funding through a PhD scholarship from the ""Equal Opportunities for Women in Research and Training"" programme at the University of Wurzburg.

To improve our understanding of the dispersal ecology of mosquitoes and to inform appropriate release strategies of 'genetically sterile' male Aedes aegypti detailed knowledge of the dispersal ability of the released insects is needed. Methodology/Principal Findings The dispersal ability of released 'genetically sterile' male Aedes aegypti at a field site in Brazil has been estimated. Dispersal kernels embedded within a generalized linear model framework were used to analyse data collected from three large scale mark release recapture studies. The methodology has been applied to previously published dispersal data to compare the dispersal ability of 'genetically sterile' male Aedes aegypti in contrasting environments. We parameterised dispersal kernels and estimated the mean distance travelled for insects in Brazil: 52.8m (95% CI: 49.9m, 56.8m) and Malaysia: 58.0m (95% CI: 51.1m, 71.0m). Conclusions/Significance Our results provide specific, detailed estimates of the dispersal characteristics of released 'genetically sterile' male Aedes aegypti in the field. The comparative analysis indicates that despite differing environments and recapture rates, key features of the insects' dispersal kernels are conserved across the two studies. The results can be used to inform both risk assessments and release programmes using ` genetically sterile' male Aedes aegypti.","[Winskill, Peter; Donnelly, Christl A.] Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Ctr Outbreak Anal & Modelling, MRC, Dept Infect Dis Epidemiol,Sch Publ Hlth,Fac Med, London, England; [Winskill, Peter; Alphey, Luke; McKemey, Andrew R.] Oxitec Ltd, Oxford, England; [Carvalho, Danilo O.] Univ Fed Rio de Janeiro, Inst Nacl Ciencia & Tecnol Entomol Mol, Rio De Janeiro, Brazil; [Capurro, Margareth L.] Univ Sao Paulo, Dept Parasitol, Sao Paulo, Brazil; [Capurro, Margareth L.] Inst Nacl Ciencia & Tecnol Entomol Mol, Rio De Janeiro, Brazil; [Alphey, Luke] Pirbright Inst, Woking, Surrey, England; [Alphey, Luke] Univ Oxford, Dept Zool, Oxford, England","Winskill, P (reprint author), Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Ctr Outbreak Anal & Modelling, MRC, Dept Infect Dis Epidemiol,Sch Publ Hlth,Fac Med, St Marys Campus, London, England.",c.donnelly@imperial.ac.uk; Andrew.McKemey@oxitec.com,"Capurro, Margareth/M-5286-2019","Alphey, Luke/0000-0002-2916-3802; Carvalho, Danilo Oliveira/0000-0001-8168-4050","BBSRC [BB/I015957/1]; Medical Research Council; SESAB - Health Secretary of Bahia State [0300110300917-033/2011]; Medical Research Council [MR/K010174/1B, MR/K010174/1]","PW was funded by the BBSRC (Training Grant, No. BB/I015957/1).

CHIKV that is generated in mosquito or mammalian cells differs in glycosylation patterns of viral proteins, which may affect its replication and virulence. Herein, we compare replication, pathogenicity, and receptor binding of CHIKV generated in Vero cells (mammal) or C6/36 cells (mosquito) through a single passage. We demonstrate that mosquito cell-derived CHIKV (CHIKVmos) has slower replication than mammalian cell-derived CHIKV (CHIKVvero), when tested in both human and murine cell lines. Consistent with this, CHIKVmos infection in both cell lines produce less cytopathic effects and reduced antiviral responses. In addition, infection in mice show that CHIKVmos produces a lower level of viremia and less severe footpad swelling when compared with CHIKVvero. Interestingly, CHIKVmos has impaired ability to bind to glycosaminoglycan (GAG) receptors on mammalian cells. However, sequencing analysis shows that this impairment is not due to a mutation in the CHIKV E2 gene, which encodes for the viral receptor binding protein. More-over, CHIKVmos progenies can regain GAG receptor binding capability and can replicate similarly to CHIKVvero after a single passage in mammalian cells. Furthermore, CHIKVvero and CHIKVmos no longer differ in replication when N-glycosylation of viral proteins was inhibited by growing these viruses in the presence of tunicamycin. Collectively, these results suggest that N-glycosylation of viral proteins within mosquito cells can result in loss of GAG receptor binding capability of CHIKV and reduction of its infectivity in mammalian cells.","[Acharya, Dhiraj; Paul, Amber M.; Bai, Fengwei] Univ So Mississippi, Dept Biol Sci, Hattiesburg, MS 39406 USA; [Anderson, John F.] Connecticut Agr Expt Stn, Dept Entomol, New Haven, CT 06504 USA; [Huang, Faqing] Univ So Mississippi, Dept Chem & Biochem, Hattiesburg, MS 39406 USA","Acharya, D (reprint author), Univ So Mississippi, Dept Biol Sci, Hattiesburg, MS 39406 USA.",fengwei.bai@usm.edu,,"Paul, Amber/0000-0002-1657-3618",The University of Southern Mississippi [DE01363],"This work was supported by a new faculty startup fund (DE01363 to FB) from The University of Southern Mississippi (www.usm.edu).

Methods/Principal Findings We conducted a cross-sectional survey to investigate the seroprevalence of brucellosis and Coxiella burnetii in humans and livestock in six secure districts in Herat from 26th December 2012-17th January 2013. A total of 204 households with livestock were surveyed in six Kuchi and five sedentary type villages. Blood samples from 1,017 humans, 1,143 sheep, 876 goats and 344 cattle were tested for brucellosis and Q fever. About one in six households (15.7%) had at least one Brucella seropositive person, about one in eight households (12.3%) had at least one Brucella seropositive animal and about one in four (24.5%) had either seropositive animals or humans. Ninety-seven percent of households had at least one C. burnetii seropositive person and 98.5% of households had one or more C. burnetii seropositive animals. Forty-seven householders had serological evidence of exposure to both C. burnetii and Brucella and eight animals were serologically positive for both diseases. Drinking unpasteurised milk (OR 1.6), treating animals for ticks (OR 1.4), milking sheep (OR 1.4), male gender (OR 1.4) and seropositivity to Brucella (OR 4.3) were identified as risk factors for seropositivity to C. burnetii in householders. Household factors associated with households having either Brucella seropositive animals or humans were Kuchi households (OR 2.5), having <= 4 rooms in the house ( OR 2.9) and not owning land (OR 2.9). Conclusions The results from this study provide baseline information for the planning and monitoring of future interventions against these diseases. The implementation of this study greatly improved collaboration, coordination and capability of veterinary and public health professionals from government, NGOs and donor funded projects.","[Akbarian, Zarif; Noormal, Bashir; Saeed, Islam; Shahab, Zabiullah] Afghan Natl Publ Hlth Inst, Minist Publ Hlth, Kabul, Afghanistan; [Ziay, Ghulam] Cent Vet Diagnost & Res Lab, Kabul, Afghanistan; [Schauwers, Willy; Dennison, Tania] Anim Hlth Dev Program, Kabul, Afghanistan; [Qanee, Abul Hussain] Minist Agr Irrigat & Livestock, Gen Directorate Anim Hlth & Prod, Kabul, Afghanistan; [Dohoo, Ian] Univ Prince Edward Isl, Charlottetown, PE C1A 4P3, Canada; [Jackson, Ronald] Massey Univ, EpiCtr, Palmerston North, New Zealand","Akbarian, Z (reprint author), Afghan Natl Publ Hlth Inst, Minist Publ Hlth, Kabul, Afghanistan.",Ron.Jackson@xtra.co.nz,,,European Commission under the Avian and Human Influenza Trust Fund,"This study was funded by the European Commission under the Avian and Human Influenza Trust Fund and administered by the World Bank.

The parasite is not typically recovered in affected tissues, so detection of parasite-specific antibodies is usually necessary for establishing a diagnosis. The most reliable immunodiagnostic methods use the Toxocara excretory-secretory antigens (TES-Ag) in ELISA formats to detect Toxocara-specific antibodies. To eliminate the need for native parasite materials, we identified and purified immunodiagnostic antigens using 2D gel electrophoresis followed by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry. Three predominant immunoreactive proteins were found in the TES; all three had been previously described in the literature: Tc-CTL-1, Tc-TES-26, and Tc-MUC-3. We generated Escherichia coli expressed recombinant proteins for evaluation in Luminex based immunoassays. We were unable to produce a functional assay with the Tc-MUC-3 recombinant protein. Tc-CTL-1 and Tc-TES-26 were successfully coupled and tested using defined serum batteries. The use of both proteins together generated better results than if the proteins were used individually. The sensitivity and specificity of the assay for detecting visceral larval migrans using Tc-CTL-1 plus Tc-TES-26 was 99% and 94%, respectively; the sensitivity for detecting ocular larval migrans was 64%. The combined performance of the new assay was superior to the currently available EIA and could potentially be employed to replace current assays that rely on native TES-Ag.","[Anderson, John P.; Rascoe, Lisa N.; Levert, Keith; Chastain, Holly M.; Rivera, Hilda N.; McAuliffe, Isabel; Wiegand, Ryan E.; Wilkins, Patricia P.; Handali, Sukwan] Ctr Dis Control & Prevent, Div Parasit Dis & Malaria, Atlanta, GA USA; [Reed, Matthew S.; Pohl, Jan] Ctr Dis Control & Prevent, Natl Ctr Emerging & Zoonot Infect Dis, Atlanta, GA USA; [Zhan, Bin; Hotez, Peter J.] Baylor Coll Med, Natl Sch Trop Med, Houston, TX 77030 USA","Anderson, JP (reprint author), Ctr Dis Control & Prevent, Div Parasit Dis & Malaria, Atlanta, GA USA.",ahi0@cdc.gov,,"Hotez, Peter/0000-0001-8770-1042",NIDDK NIH HHS [P30 DK056338],,,36,9,9,0,11,PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE,SAN FRANCISCO,"1160 BATTERY STREET, STE 100, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94111 USA",1935-2735,,,PLOS NEGLECT TROP D,Plos Neglect.

Methods The clinical and parasitological outcomes, and infectiousness to sandflies, were observed in 54 colonized animals of three species (18 Necromys lasiurus, 18 Nectomys squamipes and 18 Rattus rattus) experimentally infected with high (5.5x10(6)/ml) or low (2.8x10(5)/ml) dose L. (V.) braziliensis (MBOL/BR/2000/CPqAM95) inoculum. Clinical signs of infection were monitored daily. Whole animal xenodiagnoses were performed 6 months post inoculation using Lutzomyia longipalpis originating from flies caught in Passira, Pernambuco, after this parasite evaluation was performed at necropsy. Heterogeneities in Leishmania parasite loads were measured by quantitative PCR in ear skin, liver and spleen tissues. Results All three rodent species proved to establish infection characterized by short-term self-resolving skin lesions, located on ears and tail but not on footpads (one site of inoculation), and variable parasite loads detected in all three tissues with maximum burdens of 8.1x10(3) (skin), 2.8x10(3) (spleen), and 8.9x10(2) (liver). All three host species, 18/18 N. lasiurus, 10/18 N. squamipes and 6/18 R. rattus, also proved infectious to sandflies in cross-sectional study. R. rattus supported significantly lower tissue parasite loads compared to those in N. lasiurus and N. squamipes, and N. lasiurus appeared to be more infectious, on average, than either N. squamipes or R. rattus. Conclusions A multi-host reservoir of cutaneous leishmaniasis is indicated in this region of Brazil, though with apparent differences in the competence between the rodent species. The results provide preliminary insights into links between sylvatic and peri-domestic transmission cycles associated with overlaps in the rodent species' ecological niches.","[Andrade, Maria S.; Brito, Maria E.

Personal protection of individuals, particularly when outside, is challenging. Here we assess the efficacy and durability of different types of insecticide-treated clothing on laboratory-reared Ae. aegypti. Methods Standardised World Health Organisation Pesticide Evaluation Scheme (WHOPES) cone tests and arm-in-cage assays were used to assess knockdown (KD) and mortality of Ae. aegypti tested against factory-treated fabric, home-dipped fabric and microencapsulated fabric. Based on the testing of these three different treatment types, the most protective was selected for further analysis using arm-in cage assays with the effect of washing, ultra-violet light, and ironing investigated using high pressure liquid chromatography. Results Efficacy varied between the microencapsulated and factory dipped fabrics in cone testing. Factory-dipped clothing showed the greatest effect on KD (3 min 38.1%; 1 hour 96.5%) and mortality (97.1%) with no significant difference between this and the factory dipped school uniforms. Factory-dipped clothing was therefore selected for further testing. Factory dipped clothing provided 59% (95% CI = 49.2%-66.9%) reduction in landing and a 100% reduction in biting in arm-in-cage tests. Washing duration and technique had a significant effect, with insecticidal longevity shown to be greater with machine washing (LW50 = 33.4) compared to simulated hand washing (LW50 = 17.6). Ironing significantly reduced permethrin content after 1 week of simulated use, with a 96.7% decrease after 3 months although UV exposure did not reduce permethrin content within clothing significantly after 3 months simulated use. Conclusion Permethrin-treated clothing may be a promising intervention in reducing dengue transmission. However, our findings also suggest that clothing may provide only short-term protection due to the effect of washing and ironing, highlighting the need for improved fabric treatment techniques.","[Banks, Sarah DeRaedt; Orsborne, James; Kaur, Harparkash; Logan, James G.] Univ London London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, Dept Dis Control, London WC1E 7HT, England; [Orsborne, James; Logan, James G.] Univ London London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, Arctec, London WC1E 7HT, England; [Gezan, Salvador A.] Univ Florida, SFRC, Gainesville, FL USA; [Wilder-Smith, Annelies] Umea Univ, Dept Global Hlth & Epidemiol, Umea, Sweden; [Wilder-Smith, Annelies] Nanyang Technol Univ, Lee Kong Chian Sch Med, Singapore 639798, Singapore; [Lindsey, Steve W.] Univ Durham, Sch Biol & Biomed Sci, Durham, England","Banks, SD (reprint author), Univ London London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, Dept Dis Control, Keppel St, London WC1E 7HT, England.",james.logan@lshtm.ac.uk,"Wilder-Smith, Annelies/F-8751-2015",,European Union [282589]; Dengue Tools,"This study was funded by the European Union Seventh Framework Programme FP7/2007-2013 under grant agreement 282589, with partners from Dengue Tools (http://www.denguetools.net/).

After constructing a low-passage GFP-labeled strain of B. bacilliformis, we artificially infected Lutzomyia verrucarum and L. longipalpis populations, and subsequently monitored colonization of sand flies by fluorescence microscopy. Initially, colonization of the two fly species was indistinguishable, with bacteria exhibiting a high degree of motility, yet still confined to the abdominal midgut. After 48h, B. bacilliformis transitioned from bacillus-shape to a non-motile, small coccoid form and appeared to be digested along with the blood meal in both fly species. Differences in colonization patterns became evident at 72h when B. bacilliformis was observed at relatively high density outside the peritrophic membrane in the lumen of the midgut in L. verrucarum, but colonization of L. longipalpis was limited to the blood meal within the intra-peritrophic space of the abdominal midgut, and the majority of bacteria were digested along with the blood meal by day 7. The viability of B. bacilliformis in L. longipalpis was assessed by artificially infecting, homogenizing, and plating for determination of colony-forming units in individual flies over a 13-d time course. Bacteria remained viable at relatively high density for approximately seven days, suggesting that L. longipalpis could potentially serve as a vector. The capacity of L. longipalpis to transmit viable B. bacilliformis from infected to uninfected meals was analyzed via interrupted feeds. No viable bacteria were retrieved from uninfected blood meals in these experiments. This study provides significant information toward understanding colonization of sand flies by B. bacilliformis and also demonstrates the utility of L. longipalpis as a user-friendly, live-vector model system for studying this severely neglected tropical disease.","[Battisti, James M.; Minnick, Michael F.] Univ Montana, Div Biol Sci, Missoula, MT 59812 USA; [Lawyer, Phillip G.] NIAID, Parasit Dis Lab, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA","Battisti, JM (reprint author), Univ Montana, Div Biol Sci, Missoula, MT 59812 USA.",jim.battisti@umontana.edu,,,National Institutes of Health [AI095804],"JMB and MFM are supported by National Institutes of Health Grant AI095804.

Although regulatory T (Treg) cells were shown to control immunity against PCM, deleterious or protective effects were described in different experimental settings. To clarify the function of Treg cells in pulmonary PCM, loss and gain-of-function approaches were performed with Foxp3GFP knock-in mice and immunodeficient Rag1(-/-)mice, respectively, which were intratracheally infected with 10(6) yeast cells. The activity of Foxp3-expressing Treg cells in pulmonary PCM was determined in Foxp3GFP transgenic mice. First, it was verified that natural Treg cells migrate to the lungs of infected mice, where they become activated. Depletion of Treg cells led to reduced fungal load, diminished pathogen dissemination and increased Th1/Th2/Th17 immunity. Further, adoptive transfer of diverse T cell subsets to Rag1(-/-)mice subsequently infected by the pulmonary route demonstrated that isolated CD4(+) Foxp3(+) Treg cells were able to confer some degree of immunoprotection and that CD4(+) Foxp3-T cells alone reduced fungal growth and enhanced T cell immunity, but induced vigorous inflammatory reactions in the lungs. Nevertheless, transfer of Treg cells combined with CD4(+) Foxp3-T cells generated more efficient and balanced immune Th1/Th2/Th17 responses able to limit pathogen growth and excessive tissue inflammation, leading to regressive disease and increased survival rates. Altogether, these loss-and gain-of-function approaches allow us to clearly demonstrate the dual role of Treg cells in pulmonary PCM, their deleterious effects by impairing T cell immunity and pathogen eradication, and their protective role by suppressing exacerbated tissue inflammation.","[Bazan, Silvia B.; Costa, Tania A.; de Araujo, Eliseu Frank; Feriotti, Claudia; Loures, Flavio V.; Calich, Vera L.

Whereas recurrences were rarely observed, paradoxical reactions and functional limitations frequently occurred. Although systematic BUD control in Togo was established as early as 2007, treatment outcome has not been reviewed to date. Therefore, a pilot project on post-treatment follow-up of BUD patients in Togo aimed to evaluate treatment outcomes and to provide recommendations for optimization of treatment success. Methodology/Principal Findings Out of 199 laboratory confirmed BUD patients, 129 could be enrolled in the study. The lesions of 109 patients (84.5%) were completely healed without any complications, 5 patients (3.9%) had secondary lesions and 15 patients (11.6%) had functional limitations. Edema, category III ulcers >15cm, healing times >180 days and a limitation of movement at time of discharge constituted the main risk factors significantly associated with BUD related functional limitations (P<0.01). Review of all BUD related documentation revealed major shortcomings, in particular concerning medical records on adjuvant surgical and physiotherapeutic treatment. Conclusions/Significance This study presents the first systematic analysis of treatment outcome of BUD patients from Togo. Median times to healing and the absence of recurrences were in line with findings reported by other investigators. The percentage of functional limitations of 11.6% was lower than in other studies, and edema, category III ulcers, healing time >180 days and limitation of movement at discharge constituted the main risk factors for functional limitations in Togolese BUD patients. Standardized treatment plans, patient assessment and follow-up, as well as improved management of medical records are recommended to allow for intensified monitoring of disease progression and healing process, to facilitate implementation of therapeutic measures and to optimize treatment success.","[Beissner, Marcus; Arens, Nathalie; Bauer, Malkin; Herbinger, Karl-Heinz; Loesher, Thomas; Bretzel, Gisela] Univ Munich, Univ Hosp, Dept Infect Dis & Trop Med DITM, Munich, Germany; [Wiedemann, Franz; Nitschke, Joerg] German Leprosy & TB Relief Assoc, Togo Off DAHW T, Lome, Togo; [Kobara, Basile] Programme Natl Lutte Ulcere Buruli Lepre & Pian P, Lome, Togo; [Badziklou, Kossi; Kere, Abiba Banla] Minist Sante, Natl Inst Hyg, Lome, Togo","Beissner, M (reprint author), Univ Munich, Univ Hosp, Dept Infect Dis & Trop Med DITM, Munich, Germany.",beissner@lrz.uni-muenchen.de,,,European Community [241500],"The research leading to these results has received funding from the European Community's Seventh Framework Programme (FP7/2010-2013) under grant agreement No 241500 (BuruliVac).

We report a case of rhinoen-tomophthoromycosis from Gabon and suggest a staging system, which provides information on the prognosis and duration of antifungal therapy. Methods We present a case of rhinoentomophthoromycosis including the histopathology, mycology, and course of disease. For the suggested staging system, all cases on confirmed rhinoentomophthoromycosis published in the literature without language restriction were eligible. Exclusion criteria were missing data on (i) duration of disease before correct diagnosis, (ii) outcome, and (iii) confirmation of entomophthoralean fungus infection by histopathology and/or mycology. We classified cases into atypical (orbital cellulitis, severe pain, fever, dissemination), early, intermediate, and late disease based on the duration of symptoms before diagnosis. The outcome was evaluated for each stage of disease. Findings The literature search of the Medpilot database was conducted on January 13, 2014, (updated on January 18, 2015). The search yielded 8,333 results including 198 cases from 117 papers; of these, 145 met our inclusion criteria and were included in the final analysis. Median duration of treatment was 4, 3, 4, and 5 months in atypical, early, intermediate, and late disease, respectively. Cure rates were clearly associated with stage of disease and were 57%, 100%, 82%, and 43% in atypical, early, intermediate, and late disease, respectively. Conclusion We suggest a clinical staging system that underlines the benefit of early case detection and may guide the duration of antifungal treatment. The scientific value of this classification is its capacity to structure and harmonize the clinical and research approach towards rhinoentomophthoromycosis.","[Blumentrath, Christian G.; Grobusch, Martin P.; Zoleko-Manego, Rella; Kremsner, Peter G.] Univ Tubingen, Inst Tropenmed, Tubingen, Germany; [Blumentrath, Christian G.; Grobusch, Martin P.; Zoleko-Manego, Rella; Kremsner, Peter G.] Deutsch Zentrum Infekt Forsch, Tubingen, Germany; [Blumentrath, Christian G.; Grobusch, Martin P.; Zoleko-Manego, Rella; Kremsner, Peter G.; Schaumburg, Frieder] Albert Schweitzer Hosp Lambarene, Ctr Rech Med Lambarene CERMEL, Lambarene, Gabon; [Blumentrath, Christian G.; Matsiegui, Pierre-Blaise; Zoleko-Manego, Rella] Ctr Rech Med Ngounie, Fougamou, Gabon; [Grobusch, Martin P.] Univ Amsterdam, Acad Med Ctr, Div Internal Med, Ctr Trop Med & Travel Med,Dept Infect Dis, NL-1105 AZ Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Pahlke, Friedrich] Evidat, Stat Apps & Consulting, Sereetz, Germany; [Nzenze-Afene, Solange] Univ Sci Sante, Dept Parasitol Mycol & Med Trop, Libreville, Gabon; [Mabicka, Barthelemy] Univ Sci Sante, Dept Anat Pathol & Histol & Embryol, Libreville, Gabon; [Sanguinetti, Maurizio] Univ Cattolica Sacro Cuore, Inst Microbiol, Rome, Italy; [Schaumburg, Frieder] Univ Hosp Munster, Inst Med Microbiol, Munster, Germany","Blumentrath, CG (reprint author), Univ Tubingen, Inst Tropenmed, Tubingen, Germany.",frieder.schaumburg@ukmuenster.de,"Sanguinetti, Maurizio/A-1453-2019; Schaumburg, Frieder/E-4464-2016","Sanguinetti, Maurizio/0000-0002-9780-7059; Blumentrath, Christian Georg/0000-0001-8532-7958",,,,28,3,3,0,4,PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE,SAN FRANCISCO,"1160 BATTERY STREET, STE 100, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94111 USA",1935-2735,,,PLOS NEGLECT TROP D,Plos Neglect.

Objectives To assess the burden and risk factors of schistosomiasis and intestinal parasitic helminthes in the children of Cubal, Angola, and to compare different diagnostic approaches for urinary schistosomiasis under field conditions. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted. Urine and faeces samples of school children were microscopically studied. A random sample of children was obtained from an alphabetically arranged list of children, taking one of two children. Urine dipstick, colorimetric test and macrohaematuria were considered as indirect diagnostic methods and compared to direct urine examination. Possible risk factors for the infection were sex, age, distance to the river and previous treatment with praziquantel; the assessment was performed using Chi-square test. Results A total of 785 (61.18%) children showed S. haematobium eggs in urine; children living within 500 meters from the river had a higher odds for infection: Odds ratio 1.97 (1.45-2.7 CI 95%); urine dipstick showed sensitivity of 96% and specificity of 61.3%, with a positive predictive value; colorimetric test showed sensitivity of 52.5%, specificity of 74.6% and a positive predictive value of 77%. Proteinuria was present in 653 (51.1%) children, being more frequent in children with S. haematobium in urine (75.2%); 32 of 191 stool samples (16%) showed the presence of other intestinal parasites and 8 (4%) for S. haematobium. Conclusions Prevalence of urinary schistosomiasis in our study area is much higher than the national average, considering it as a high-risk community. Proximity to a source of water was a risk factor for the infection. Indirect tests, as urine dipstick and colorimetric test, were useful tools for diagnosis, due to ease of use and low cost. Proteinuria was a common finding, probably showing an early structural damage due to schistosomiasis in this group of children.","[Bocanegra, Cristina] PROSICS Barcelona, Special Program Infect Dis Drassanes Vall dHebron, Barcelona, Spain; [Bocanegra, Cristina; Gallego, Sara; Moreno, Milagros; Sikaleta, Nicolau; Nindia, Arlette; Tchipita, Daniel; Joromba, Morais; Kavaya, Sebastiao; Lopez, Teresa] Hosp Nossa Senhora Paz, Cubal, Angola; [Mendioroz, Jacobo] Univ Hosp Vall dHebron, Dept Epidemiol, Barcelona, Spain; [Sulleiro, Elena] PROSICS Barcelona, Dept Microbiol, Univ Hosp Vall dHebron, Barcelona, Spain; [Salvador, Fernando; Sanchez Montalva, Adrian; Molina, Israel] PROSICS Barcelona, Dept Infect Dis, Univ Hosp Vall dHebron, Barcelona, Spain","Bocanegra, C (reprint author), PROSICS Barcelona, Special Program Infect Dis Drassanes Vall dHebron, Barcelona, Spain.",cristinabocanegra@gmail.com,,"Salvador, Fernando/0000-0002-0546-1354; Sulleiro, Elena/0000-0002-9783-6060; Molina Romero, Israel/0000-0001-6642-7515; Mendioroz, Jacobo/0000-0002-8883-2180",,,,27,7,7,0,5,PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE,SAN FRANCISCO,"1160 BATTERY STREET, STE 100, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94111 USA",1935-2735,,,PLOS NEGLECT TROP D,Plos Neglect.

Complement inhibitors are necessary to avoid the excessive consumption and activation of this system on host cells. Leptospirosis is a worldwide zoonosis caused by spirochetes from the genus Leptospira. Pathogenic leptospires are able to escape from complement activation by binding to host complement inhibitors Factor H [FH] and C4b-binding protein (C4BP) while non-pathogenic leptospires are rapidly killed in the presence of fresh serum. In this study, we demonstrate that complement control protein domains (CCP) 7 and 8 of C4BP alpha-chain interact with the outer membrane proteins LcpA, LigA and LigB from the pathogenic leptospire L. interrogans. The interaction between C4BP and LcpA, LigA and LigB is sensitive to ionic strength and inhibited by heparin. We fine mapped the LigA and LigB domains involved in its binding to C4BP and heparin and found that both interactions are mediated through the bacterial immunoglobulin-like (Big) domains 7 and 8 (LigA7-8 and LigB7-8) of both LigA and LigB and also through LigB9-10. Therefore, C4BP and heparin may share the same binding sites on Lig proteins.","[Breda, Leandro C.

Current research has focused largely on wildlife and vector-borne zoonotic diseases, neglecting to investigate landscape disturbance and environmental bacterial infections. One example is Buruli ulcer (BU) disease, a necrotizing skin disease caused by the environmental pathogen Mycobacterium ulcerans (MU). Empirical and anecdotal observations have linked BU incidence to landscape disturbance, but potential relationships have not been quantified as they relate to land cover configurations. Methodology/Principal Findings A landscape ecological approach utilizing Bayesian hierarchical models with spatial random effects was used to test study hypotheses that land cover configurations indicative of anthropogenic disturbance were related to Buruli ulcer (BU) disease in southern Benin, and that a spatial structure existed for drivers of BU case distribution in the region. A final objective was to generate a continuous, risk map across the study region. Results suggested that villages surrounded by naturally shaped, or undisturbed rather than disturbed, wetland patches at a distance within 1200m were at a higher risk for BU, and study outcomes supported the hypothesis that a spatial structure exists for the drivers behind BU risk in the region. The risk surface corresponded to known BU endemicity in Benin and identified moderate risk areas within the boundary of Togo. Conclusions/Significance This study was a first attempt to link land cover configurations representative of anthropogenic disturbances to BU prevalence. Study results identified several significant variables, including the presence of natural wetland areas, warranting future investigations into these factors at additional spatial and temporal scales. A major contribution of this study included the incorporation of a spatial modeling component that predicted BU rates to new locations without strong knowledge of environmental factors contributing to disease distribution.","[Campbell, Lindsay P.] Univ Kansas, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Lawrence, KS 66045 USA; [Campbell, Lindsay P.] Univ Kansas, Biodivers Inst, Lawrence, KS 66045 USA; [Finley, Andrew O.] Michigan State Univ, Dept Forestry, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Finley, Andrew O.; Qi, Jiaguo] Michigan State Univ, Dept Geog, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Benbow, M.

The current outbreak of leishmaniasis in Fuenlabrada (in the southwest of the region of Madrid, Spain) has involved 600 clinical cases since late 2009 (prevalence 0.2%). It may therefore be wise to monitor the town's transplanted population for Leishmania infantum; its members are immunosuppressed and at greater risk of infection and relapse following treatment. The present work examines the use of cytokine release assays to determine the prevalence of Leishmania infection in this population, and to confirm recovery following treatment for visceral leishmaniasis (VL). The humoral and cellular immune responses to L. infantum were characterized in 63 solid organ transplant (SOT) recipients from Fuenlabrada, 57 of whom reported no previous episode of VL (NVL subjects), and six of whom had been cured of VL (CVL subjects). Seventeen subjects (12 NVL and 5 CVL) showed a patent lymphoproliferative response to soluble Leishmania antigen (SLA). Stimulation of peripheral blood mononuclear cell cultures and of whole blood with SLA led to the production of different combinations of cytokines that might serve to confirm Leishmania infection or recovery from VL and help prevent cured patients from relapsing into this serious condition.","[Carrillo, Eugenia; Fernandez, Laura; Moreno, Javier] Inst Salud Carlos III, Ctr Nacl Microbiol, WHO Collaborating Ctr Leishmaniasis, Madrid, Spain; [Carrasco-Anton, Nerea; Lopez-Medrano, Francisco; Maria Aguado, Jose] Univ Complutense Madrid, Hosp Univ Octubre 12, Unidad Enfermedades Infecciosas, Madrid, Spain; [Salto, Efren] Univ Complutense Madrid, Hosp Univ Octubre 12, Microbiol Serv, Madrid, Spain; [Victor San Martin, Juan] Hosp Fuenlabrada, Med Interna Serv, Madrid, Spain; [Alvar, Jorge] Drugs Neglected Dis Initiat, Visceral Leishmaniasis Program, Geneva, Switzerland","Carrillo, E (reprint author), Inst Salud Carlos III, Ctr Nacl Microbiol, WHO Collaborating Ctr Leishmaniasis, Madrid, Spain.",ecarrillo@isciii.es,"Carrillo, Eugenia/F-2058-2018","Carrillo, Eugenia/0000-0002-7869-7915; Moreno, Javier/0000-0003-0087-4659; San Martin, Juan Victor/0000-0003-4457-5124","WHO [APW-2012/271093]; Instituto de Salud Carlos III via the Tropical Diseases Research Network [RICET RD12/0018/0003, RD12/0018/0008]; Instituto de Salud Carlos III via ISCIII-AES project Impact of leishmaniasis outbreak in the southwest of Madrid in the immunosuppressed population [PI13/00440]; VII PN I+D+I; FEDER Funds [RICET RD12/0018/0003]","We gratefully acknowledge the financial support of WHO via the APW-2012/271093 project and of the Instituto de Salud Carlos III via the Tropical Diseases Research Network (RICET RD12/0018/0003 and RD12/0018/0008) (URL) (www.ricet.es/en/) and via ISCIII-AES project Impact of leishmaniasis outbreak in the southwest of Madrid in the immunosuppressed population (PI13/00440).

A set of 10 treponemal genome sequences including those of 4 Treponema pallidum ssp. pallidum (TPA) strains (Nichols, DAL-1, Mexico A, SS14), 4 T. p. ssp. pertenue (TPE) strains (CDC-2, Gauthier, Samoa D, Fribourg-Blanc), 1 T. p. ssp. endemicum (TEN) strain (Bosnia A) and one strain (Cuniculi A) of Treponema paraluisleporidarum ecovar Cuniculus (TPLC) were examined with respect to the presence of nucleotide intrastrain heterogeneous sites. Methodology/Principal Findings The number of identified intrastrain heterogeneous sites in individual genomes ranged between 0 and 7. Altogether, 23 intrastrain heterogeneous sites (in 17 genes) were found in 5 out of 10 investigated treponemal genomes including TPA strains Nichols (n = 5), DAL-1 (n = 4), and SS14 (n = 7), TPE strain Samoa D (n = 1), and TEN strain Bosnia A (n = 5). Although only one heterogeneous site was identified among 4 tested TPE strains, 16 such sites were identified among 4 TPA strains. Heterogeneous sites were mostly strain-specific and were identified in four tpr genes (tprC, GI, I, K), in genes involved in bacterial motility and chemotaxis (fliI, cheC-fliY), in genes involved in cell structure (murC), translation (prfA), general and DNA metabolism (putative SAM dependent methyltransferase, topA), and in seven hypothetical genes.

Methods We sampled 1,832 individuals aged 5-90 years from 30 communities in Mayuge District, Uganda. Demographic, village, and parasitological data were collected. Infection risk factors were compared in ordinal logistic regressions. Anaemia and infection intensities were analyzed in multilevel models, and population attributable fractions were estimated. Findings Household and village-level predictors of Schistosoma mansoni and hookworm were opposite in direction or significant for single infections. S. mansoni was found primarily in children, whereas hookworm was prevalent amongst the elderly. Anaemia was more prevalent in individuals with S. mansoni and increased by 2.86 fold (p-value< 0.001) with heavy S. mansoni infection intensity. Individuals with heavy hookworm were 1.65 times (p-value = 0.008) more likely to have anaemia than uninfected participants. Amongst individuals with heavy S. mansoni infection intensity, 32.0% (p-value< 0.001) of anaemia could be attributed to S. mansoni. For people with heavy hookworm infections, 23.7% (p-value = 0.002) of anaemia could be attributed to hookworm. A greater fraction of anaemia (24.9%, p-value = 0.002) was attributable to heavy hookworm infections in adults (excluding pregnant women) as opposed to heavy hookworm infections in school-aged children and pregnant women (20.2%, p-value = 0.001). Conclusion Community-based surveys captured anaemia in children and adults affected by S. mansoni and hookworm infections. For areas endemic with schistosomiasis or hookworm infections, WHO guidelines should include adults for treatment in helminth control programmes.","[Chami, Goylette F.; Bulte, Erwin; Kontoleon, Andreas A.] Univ Cabridge, Dept Land Econ, Cambridge, England; [Chami, Goylette F.; Dunne, David W.] Univ Cambridge, Dept Pathol, Cambridge CB2 1QP, England; [Fenwick, Alan; Kabatereine, Narcis B.] Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Schistosomiasis Control Initiat, London, England; [Bulte, Erwin] Wageningen Univ, Dev Econ Grp, NL-6700 AP Wageningen, Netherlands; [Kabatereine, Narcis B.; Tukahebwa, Edridah M.] Uganda Minist Hlth, Vector Control Div, Bilharzia & Worm Control Programme, Kampala, Uganda","Chami, GF (reprint author), Univ Cabridge, Dept Land Econ, Cambridge, England.",gjc36@cam.ac.uk; dwd10@cam.ac.uk,,"Chami, Goylette/0000-0002-4653-0846; Bulte, Erwin/0000-0001-9491-5268; Dunne, David/0000-0002-8940-9886",Vice Chancellor's Fund of the University of Cambridge; Schistosomiasis Control Initiative; Wellcome Trust [083931/Z/07/Z]; Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (N.W.O. grant) [452-04-333],"This work was supported by the Vice Chancellor's Fund of the University of Cambridge, the Schistosomiasis Control Initiative, the Wellcome Trust (Programme grant 083931/Z/07/Z to DWD), and the Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (N.W.O. grant 452-04-333 to EB).

Whole organism data suggest its anthelmintic action is underpinned by a selective activation of the nematode isoform of an evolutionary conserved Ca2+-activated K+ channel, SLO-1. To test this at the molecular level we compared the actions of emodepside at heterologously expressed SLO-1 alpha subunit orthologues from nematode (Caenorhabditis elegans), Drosophila melanogaster and human using whole cell voltage clamp. Intriguingly we found that emodepside modulated nematode (Ce slo-1), insect (Drosophila, Dm slo) and human (hum kcnma1) SLO channels but that there are discrete differences in the features of the modulation that are consistent with its anthelmintic efficacy. Nematode SLO-1 currents required 100 mu M intracellular Ca2+ and were strongly facilitated by emodepside (100 nM; + 73.0 +/- 17.4%; n = 9; p< 0.001). Drosophila Slo currents on the other hand were activated by emodepside (10 mu M) in the presence of 52 nM Ca2+ but were inhibited in the presence of 290 nM Ca2+ and exhibited a characteristic loss of rectification. Human Slo required 300nM Ca2+ and emodepside transiently facilitated currents (100nM; + 33.5 +/- 9%; n = 8; p< 0.05) followed by a sustained inhibition (-52.6 +/- 9.8%; n = 8; p< 0.001). This first cross phyla comparison of the actions of emodepside at nematode, insect and human channels provides new mechanistic insight into the compound's complex modulation of SLO channels. Consistent with whole organism behavioural studies on C. elegans, it indicates its anthelmintic action derives from a strong activation of SLO current, not observed in the human channel. These data provide an important benchmark for the wider deployment of emodepside as an anthelmintic treatment.","[Crisford, Anna; Ndukwe, Kelechi; O'Connor, Vincent; Walker, Robert J.; Holden-Dye, Lindy] Univ Southampton, Ctr Biol Sci, Southampton, Hants, England; [Ebbinghaus-Kintscher, Ulrich; Schoenhense, Eva; Raming, Klaus] Bayer CropSci Aktiengesell, BCS AG R&D SMR PC PCB PB, Monheim, Germany; [Harder, Achim] Bayer Anim Hlth GmbH, BHC GDD AH PARA AR, Monheim, Germany; [O'Kelly, Ita] Southampton Gen Hosp, Fac Med, Southampton SO9 4XY, Hants, England","Crisford, A (reprint author), Univ Southampton, Ctr Biol Sci, Southampton, Hants, England.",lmhd@soton.ac.uk,,,National Institute of Health; Bayer AnimalHealth; Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council [BB/J008168/1],"KN was funded by the National Institute of Health.

Vaccination of domestic pigs has been suggested as a ""one health"" strategy to reduce viral disease transmission to humans. The efficiency of two lentiviral TRIP/JEV vectors expressing the JEV envelope prM and E glycoproteins at eliciting protective humoral response was assessed in a mouse model and piglets. Methodology/Principal Findings A gene encoding the envelope proteins prM and E from a genotype 3 JEV strain was inserted into a lentiviral TRIP vector. Two lentiviral vectors TRIP/JEV were generated, each expressing the prM signal peptide followed by the prM protein and the E glycoprotein, the latter being expressed either in its native form or lacking its two C-terminal transmembrane domains. In vitro transduction of cells with the TRIP/JEV vector expressing the native prM and E resulted in the efficient secretion of virus-like particles of Japanese encephalitis virus. Immunization of BALB/c mice with TRIP/JEV vectors resulted in the production of IgGs against Japanese encephalitis virus, and the injection of a second dose one month after the prime injection greatly boosted antibody titers. The TRIP/JEV vectors elicited neutralizing antibodies against JEV strains belonging to genotypes 1, 3, and 5. Immunization of piglets with two doses of the lentiviral vector expressing JEV virus-like particles led to high titers of anti-JEV antibodies, that had efficient neutralizing activity regardless of the JEV genotype tested. Conclusions/Significance Immunization of pigs with the lentiviral vector expressing JEV virus-like particles is particularly efficient to prime antigen-specific humoral immunity and trigger neutralizing antibody responses against JEV genotypes 1, 3, and 5. The titers of neutralizing antibodies elicited by the TRIP/JEV vector are sufficient to confer protection in domestic pigs against different genotypes of JEV and this could be of a great utility in endemic regions where more than one genotype is circulating.","[de Wispelaere, Melissanne; Frenkiel, Marie-Pascale; Paulous, Sylvie; Despres, Philippe] Inst Pasteur, Interact Mol Flavivirus Hotes, Paris, France; [Ricklin, Meret; Garcia-Nicolas, Obdulio; Summerfield, Artur] Inst Immunol & Virol, Mittelhausern, Switzerland; [Souque, Philippe; Charneau, Pierre] Inst Pasteur, Virol Mol & Vaccinol, Paris, France; [Summerfield, Artur] Univ Bern, Vetsuisse Fac, Dept Infect Dis & Pathobiol, Bern, Switzerland","de Wispelaere, M (reprint author), Inst Pasteur, Interact Mol Flavivirus Hotes, Paris, France.",pierre.charneau@pasteur.fr; philippe.despres@pasteur.fr,"CHARNEAU, Pierre/M-1565-2017; Summerfield, Artur/H-6025-2019; de Wispelaere, Melissanne/S-3117-2019","CHARNEAU, Pierre/0000-0003-1184-5773; Summerfield, Artur/0000-0001-8292-4634; de Wispelaere, Melissanne/0000-0002-0682-3054",European Union [278433-PREDEMICS]; European Commission CORDIS,"The research leading to these results and MdW, MR received funding from the European Union's Seventh Framework Program for research, technological development and demonstration under Grant Agreement no 278433-PREDEMICS. website: http://predemics.biomedtrain.eu, European Commission CORDIS: http://cordis.europa.eu/result/rcn/55956_en.html.

We previously showed that a genetically attenuated Yersinia pseudotuberculosis producing the Yersinia pestis F1 antigen was an efficient live oral vaccine against pneumonic plague. This candidate vaccine however failed to confer full protection against bubonic plague and did not produce F1 stably. Methodology/Principal Findings The caf operon encoding F1 was inserted into the chromosome of a genetically attenuated Y. pseudotuberculosis, yielding the VTnF1 strain, which stably produced the F1 capsule. Given orally to mice, VTnF1 persisted two weeks in the mouse gut and induced a high humoral response targeting both F1 and other Y. pestis antigens. The strong cellular response elicited was directed mostly against targets other than F1, but also against F1. It involved cells with a Th1-Th17 effector profile, producing IFN gamma, IL-17, and IL-10. A single oral dose (10(8) CFU) of VTnF1 conferred 100% protection against pneumonic plague using a high-dose challenge (3,300 LD50) caused by the fully virulent Y. pestis CO92. Moreover, vaccination protected 100% of mice from bubonic plague caused by a challenge with 100 LD50 Y. pestis and 93% against a high-dose infection (10,000 LD50). Protection involved fast-acting mechanisms controlling Y. pestis spread out of the injection site, and the protection provided was long-lasting, with 93% and 50% of mice surviving bubonic and pneumonic plague respectively, six months after vaccination. Vaccinated mice also survived bubonic and pneumonic plague caused by a high-dose of non-encapsulated (F1(-)) Y. pestis. Significance VTnF1 is an easy-to-produce, genetically stable plague vaccine candidate, providing a highly efficient and long-lasting protection against both bubonic and pneumonic plague caused by wild type or un-encapsulated (F1-negative) Y. pestis. To our knowledge, VTnF1 is the only plague vaccine ever reported that could provide high and durable protection against the two forms of plague after a single oral administration.","[Derbise, Anne; Hanada, Yuri; Khalife, Manal; Carniel, Elisabeth; Demeure, Christian E.] Inst Pasteur, Unite Rech Yersinia, Paris, France","Derbise, A (reprint author), Inst Pasteur, Unite Rech Yersinia, Paris, France.",cdemeure@pasteur.fr,,,,,,50,10,11,0,7,PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE,SAN FRANCISCO,"1160 BATTERY STREET, STE 100, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94111 USA",1935-2735,,,PLOS NEGLECT TROP D,Plos Neglect.

The co-infection leads to profound immunosuppression and high rate of annual VL recurrence. This study assessed the effectiveness, safety and feasibility of monthly pentamidine infusions to prevent recurrence of VL in HIV co-infected patients. Methods A single-arm, open-label trial was conducted at two leishmaniasis treatment centers in northwest Ethiopia. HIV-infected patients with a VL episode were included after parasitological cure. Monthly infusions of 4mg/kg pentamidine-isethionate diluted in normal-saline were started for 12months. All received antiretroviral therapy (ART). Time-to-relapse or death was the primary end point. Results Seventy-four patients were included. The probability of relapse-free survival at 6months and at 12 months was 79% and 71% respectively. Renal failure, a possible drug-related serious adverse event, occurred in two patients with severe pneumonia. Forty-one patients completed the regimen taking at least 11 of the 12 doses. Main reasons to discontinue were: 15 relapsed, five died and seven became lost to follow-up. More patients failed among those with a CD4+cell count <= 50cells/mu l, 5/7 (71.4%) than those with counts above 200 cells/mu l, 2/12 (16.7%), (p = 0.005). Conclusion Pentamidine secondary prophylaxis led to a 29% failure rate within one year, much lower than reported in historical controls (50%-100%). Patients with low CD4+cell counts are at increased risk of relapse despite effective initial VL treatment, ART and secondary prophylaxis. VL should be detected and treated early enough in patients with HIV infection before profound immune deficiency installs.","[Diro, Ermias; Mohammed, Rezika; Fikre, Helina] Univ Gondar, Gondar, Ethiopia; [Diro, Ermias; Boelaert, Marleen; Ravinetto, Raffaella; De Crop, Maaike; Colebunders, Robert; van Loen, Harry; Menten, Joris; Lynen, Lutgarde; van Griensven, Johan] Inst Trop Med, B-2000 Antwerp, Belgium; [Ritmeijer, Koert] Med Frontieres, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Alves, Fabiana] Drugs Neglected Dis Initiat, Geneva, Switzerland; [Abongomera, Charles; Adera, Cherinet] Med Frontieres, Abdurafi, Ethiopia; [Ravinetto, Raffaella] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Dept Pharmaceut & Pharmacol Sci, Leuven, Belgium; [Hailu, Asrat] Univ Addis Ababa, Sch Med, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia","Diro, E (reprint author), Univ Gondar, Gondar, Ethiopia.",Ermi_diro@yahoo.com,"Boelaert, Marleen/E-2698-2012","Boelaert, Marleen/0000-0001-8051-6776",European Union [305178]; Drugs for Neglected Diseases initiative; Belgian Directorate General for Development Cooperation,"This work was supported by the European Union Seventh Framework Programme (FP7/2007-2013) under grant agreement no 305178 via AfriCoLeish project, and the Drugs for Neglected Diseases initiative.

As such, it was mainly found associated with rice culture, recreational activities and flooding. This is also the reason why it has mainly been investigated in temperate as well as warm and humid regions, while arid zones have been only very occasionally monitored for this disease. In particular, data for West African countries are extremely scarce. Here, we took advantage of an extensive survey of urban rodents in Niamey, Niger, in order to look for rodent-borne pathogenic Leptospira species presence and distribution across the city. To do so, we used high throughput bacterial 16S-based metabarcoding, lipL32 gene-targeting RT-PCR, rrs gene sequencing and VNTR typing as well as GIS-based multivariate spatial analysis. Our results show that leptospires seem absent from the core city where usual Leptospira reservoir rodent species (namely R. rattus and M. natalensis) are yet abundant. On the contrary, L. kirschneri was detected in Arvicanthis niloticus and Cricetomys gambianus, two rodent species that are restricted to irrigated cultures within the city. Moreover, the VNTR profiles showed that rodent-borne leptospires in Niamey belong to previously undescribed serovars. Altogether, our study points towards the importance of market gardening in maintain and circulation of leptospirosis within Sahelian cities. In Africa, irrigated urban agriculture constitutes a pivotal source of food supply, especially in the context of the ongoing extensive urbanization of the continent. With this in mind, we speculate that leptospirosis may represent a zoonotic disease of concern also in arid regions that would deserve to be more rigorously surveyed, especially in urban agricultural settings.","[Dobigny, Gauthier] UMR IRD INRA CIRAD SupAgro Montpellier, Ctr Biol Gest Populat, Inst Rech Dev, Montferrier Sur Lez, France; [Garba, Madougou] Minist Agr, Direct Gen Protect Vegetaux, Niamey, Niger; [Tatard, Caroline; Loiseau, Anne; Galan, Max; Rossi, Jean-Pierre] CBGP, Inst Natl Rech Agron, Montferrier Sur Lez, France; [Kadaoure, Ibrahima] USAid Fews Net, Ctr Reg Agrhymet, Niamey, Niger; [Picardeau, Mathieu] Inst Pasteur, Unite Biol Spirochetes, Ctr Natl Ref, Paris, France; [Picardeau, Mathieu] Ctr Collaborateur IOMS Leptospirose, Paris, France; [Bertherat, Eric] WHO, CH-1211 Geneva, Switzerland","Dobigny, G (reprint author), UMR IRD INRA CIRAD SupAgro Montpellier, Ctr Biol Gest Populat, Inst Rech Dev, Campus Int Baillarguet CS30016, Montferrier Sur Lez, France.",gauthier.dobigny@ird.fr,,,"Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement (France); 'BEST' from the ""Service de Renforcement des Capacites"" (Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement), France","Lab and field work were funded by the ""Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement"" (France).

Recent evidence has shown a potential risk of increased incidence in central Africa. Despite attempts to isolate the virus from wild rodents and other small mammals, no reservoir host has been identified. In 2003, Monkeypox virus (MPXV) was accidentally introduced into the U.S. via the pet trade and was associated with the Gambian pouched rat (Cricetomys gambianus). Therefore, we investigated the potential reservoir competence of the Gambian pouched rat for MPXV by utilizing a combination of in vivo and in vitro methods. We inoculated three animals by the intradermal route and three animals by the intranasal route, with one mock-infected control for each route. Bioluminescent imaging (BLI) was used to track replicating virus in infected animals and virological assays (e.g. real time PCR, cell culture) were used to determine viral load in blood, urine, ocular, nasal, oral, and rectal swabs. Intradermal inoculation resulted in clinical signs of monkeypox infection in two of three animals. One severely ill animal was euthanized and the other affected animal recovered. In contrast, intranasal inoculation resulted in subclinical infection in all three animals. All animals, regardless of apparent or inapparent infection, shed virus in oral and nasal secretions. Additionally, BLI identified viral replication in the skin without grossly visible lesions. These results suggest that Gambian pouched rats may play an important role in transmission of the virus to humans, as they are hunted for consumption and it is possible for MPXV-infected pouched rats to shed infectious virus without displaying overt clinical signs.","[Falendysz, Elizabeth A.; Rocke, Tonie E.] US Geol Survey, Natl Wildlife Hlth Ctr, Madison, WI USA; [Lopera, Juan G.; Lorenzsonn, Faye; Osorio, Jorge E.] Univ Wisconsin, Sch Vet Med, Dept Pathobiol Sci, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Salzer, Johanna S.; Hutson, Christina L.; Doty, Jeffrey; Gallardo-Romero, Nadia; Carroll, Darin S.] Ctr Dis Control & Prevent, Poxvirus & Rabies Branch, Div High Consequence Pathogens & Pathol, Natl Ctr Zoonot & Vector Borne & Enter Dis, Atlanta, GA USA","Falendysz, EA (reprint author), US Geol Survey, Natl Wildlife Hlth Ctr, Madison, WI USA.",trocke@usgs.gov,,"Falendysz, Elizabeth/0000-0003-2895-8918; Rocke, Tonie/0000-0003-3933-1563",National Institutes of Health [NIH R01 TW 8859-3],"This study was funded by the National Institutes of Health (www.NIH.gov), grant number NIH R01 TW 8859-3.

We used a panel of monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) to map the antigenic structure of live JEV virus, untreated control virus (UCV), formalin-inactivated commercial vaccine (FICV), and formalin-inactivated virus (FIV). The binding activity of T16 MAb against Nakayama-derived FICV and several strains of FIV was significantly lower compared to live virus and UCV. T16 MAb, a weakly neutralizing JEV serocomplex antibody, was found to inhibit JEV infection at the post-attachment step. The T16 epitope was mapped to amino acids 329, 331, and 389 within domain III (EDIII) of the envelope (E) glycoprotein. When we explored the effect of formalin inactivation on the immunogenicity of JEV, we found that Nakayama-derived FICV, FIV, and UCV all exhibited similar immunogenicity in a mouse model, inducing anti-JEV and anti-EDII 101/ 106/107 epitope-specific antibodies. However, the EDIII 329/331/389 epitope-specific IgG antibody and neutralizing antibody titers were significantly lower for FICV-immunized and FIV-immunized mouse serum than for UCV-immunized. Formalin inactivation seems to alter the antigenic structure of the E protein, which may reduce the potency of commercially available JEV vaccines. Virus inactivation by H2O2, but not by UV or by short-duration and higher temperature formalin treatment, is able to maintain the antigenic structure of the JEV E protein. Thus, an alternative inactivation method, such as H2O2, which is able to maintain the integrity of the E protein may be essential to improving the potency of inactivated JEV vaccines.","[Fan, Yi-Chin; Chiou, Shyan-Song] Natl Chung Hsing Univ, Grad Inst Microbiol & Publ Hlth, Taichung 40227, Taiwan; [Chiu, Hsien-Chung] Natl Def Med Ctr, Sch Dent, Dept Periodontol, Taipei, Taiwan; [Chiu, Hsien-Chung] Triserv Gen Hosp, Taipei, Taiwan; [Chen, Li-Kuang] Tzu Chi Univ, Coll Med, Hualien, Taiwan; [Chang, Gwong-Jen J.] Ctr Dis Control & Prevent, Arboviral Dis Branch, Ft Collins, CO USA","Fan, YC (reprint author), Natl Chung Hsing Univ, Grad Inst Microbiol & Publ Hlth, Taichung 40227, Taiwan.",sschiou@dragon.nchu.edu.tw,,"Fan, Yi-Chin/0000-0003-1866-0800",,,,88,14,14,1,7,PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE,SAN FRANCISCO,"1160 BATTERY STREET, STE 100, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94111 USA",1935-2735,,,PLOS NEGLECT TROP D,Plos Neglect.

CL causes enormous suffering in many countries worldwide. There is no licensed vaccine against CL, and the chemotherapy options show limited efficacy and high toxicity. Localization of the parasites inside host cells is a barrier to most standard chemo- and immune-based interventions. Hence, novel drugs, which are safe, effective and readily accessible to third-world countries and/or drug delivery technologies for effective CL treatments are desperately needed. Methodology/Principal Findings Here we evaluated the antileishmanial properties and delivery potential of polyhexamethylene biguanide (PHMB; polyhexanide), a widely used antimicrobial and wound antiseptic, in the Leishmania model. PHMB showed an inherent antileishmanial activity at submicromolar concentrations. Our data revealed that PHMB kills Leishmania major (L. major) via a dual mechanism involving disruption of membrane integrity and selective chromosome condensation and damage. PHMB's DNA binding and host cell entry properties were further exploited to improve the delivery and immunomodulatory activities of unmethylated cytosine-phosphate-guanine oligodeoxynucleotides (CpG ODN). PHMB spontaneously bound CpG ODN, forming stable nanopolyplexes that enhanced uptake of CpG ODN, potentiated antimicrobial killing and reduced host cell toxicity of PHMB. Conclusions Given its low cost and long history of safe topical use, PHMB holds promise as a drug for CL therapy and delivery vehicle for nucleic acid immunomodulators.","[Firdessa, Rebuma; Schultheis, Martina; Roeger, Bianca; Oelschlaeger, Tobias A.; Moll, Heidrun] Univ Wurzburg, Inst Mol Infect Biol, D-97070 Wurzburg, Germany; [Good, Liam; Chindera, Kantaraja; Kamaruzzaman, Nor Fadhilah] Univ London, Royal Vet Coll, London, England; [Amstalden, Maria Cecilia; Hecht, Nina; Meinel, Lorenz; Luehmann, Tessa] Univ Wurzburg, Inst Pharm & Food Chem, D-97070 Wurzburg, Germany","Firdessa, R (reprint author), Univ Wurzburg, Inst Mol Infect Biol, D-97070 Wurzburg, Germany.",lgood@rvc.ac.uk; heidrun.moll@uni-wuerzburg.de,"Kamarulzaman, Shahrul/B-9728-2010; Firdessa, Rebuma/P-6238-2019; Meinel, Lorenz/D-9997-2015","Meinel, Lorenz/0000-0002-7549-7627; KAMARUZZAMAN, NOR FADHILAH/0000-0002-3092-1201; Fite, Rebuma Firdessa/0000-0003-2523-165X","German Excellence Initiative; Science without Borders Program; CAPES Foundation; Ministry of Education of Brazil, Brasilia; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) [SFB 630]","RF was supported by fellowships of the German Excellence Initiative to the Graduate School of Life Sciences and DAAD STIBET Abschlussbeihilfe, University of Wurzburg, Germany.

There is no standard guideline for diagnosis and treatment for PKDL. A species-specific PCR on slit skin smear demonstrated a sensitivity of 93.8%, but it has not been applied for routine diagnostic purpose. The study was conducted to determine the actual disease burden in an endemic area of Malda district, West Bengal, comparison of the three diagnostic tools for PKDL case detection and pattern of lesion regression after treatment. The prevalence of PKDL was determined by active surveillance and confirmed by PCR based diagnosis. Patients were treated with either sodium stibogluconate (SSG) or oral miltefosine and followed up for two years to observe lesion regression period. Twenty six PKDL cases were detected with a prevalence rate of 27.5% among the antileishmanial antibody positive cases. Among three diagnostic methods used, PCR is highly sensitive (88.46%) for case confirmation. In majority of the cases skin lesions persisted after treatment completion which gradually disappeared during 6-12 months post treatment period. Reappearance of lesions noted in two cases after 1.5 years of miltefosine treatment. A significant number of PKDL patients would remain undiagnosed without active mass surveys. Such surveys are required in other endemic areas to attain the ultimate goal of eliminating Kala-azar. PCR-based method is helpful in confirming diagnosis of PKDL, referral laboratory at district or state level can achieve it. So a well-designed study with higher number of samples is essential to establish when/whether PKDL patients are free from parasite after treatment and to determine which PKDL patients need treatment for longer period.","[Ganguly, Swagata; Saha, Pabitra; Chatterjee, Moytrey; Roy, Surajit; Kundu, Pratip K.; Bera, Dilip K.; Maji, Ardhendu K.] Calcutta Sch Trop Med, Dept Microbiol, Kolkata, W Bengal, India; [Ganguly, Swagata] NRS Med Coll Hosp, Dept Microbiol, Kolkata, W Bengal, India; [Saha, Pabitra] APC Roy Govt Coll, Dept Zool, Siliguri, W Bengal, India; [Ghosh, Tamal Kanti] Medinipur Med Coll, West Medinipur, W Bengal, India; [Guha, Subhasish K.] Calcutta Sch Trop Med, Dept Trop Med, Kolkata, W Bengal, India; [Basu, Nandita] Calcutta Sch Trop Med, Dept Pathol, Kolkata, W Bengal, India","Ganguly, S (reprint author), Calcutta Sch Trop Med, Dept Microbiol, Kolkata, W Bengal, India.",swagatamedicine@gmail.com,"Saha, Pabitra/J-6766-2019",,Indian Council of Medical Research.,"The study was funded by the Indian Council of Medical Research.

Releases of Metarhizium anisopliae-exposed Ae. aegypti males to disseminate conidia among female mosquitoes by mating represents a promising biological control approach against this important vector. A better understanding of fungus virulence and impact on reproductive parameters of Ae. aegypti, is need before testing auto-dissemination strategies. Methodology/Principal Findings Mortality, mating competitiveness, sperm production, and the capacity to auto-disseminate the fungus to females up to the 5thcopulation, were compared between Aedes aegypti males exposed to 5.96 x 10(7) conidia per cm(2) of M. anisopliae and uninfected males. Half (50%) of fungus-exposed males (FEMs) died within the first 4 days post-exposure (PE). FEMs required 34% more time to successively copulate with 5 females (165 +/- 3 minutes) than uninfected males (109 +/- 3 minutes). Additionally, fungus infection reduced the sperm production by 87% at 5 days PE. Some beneficial impacts were observed, FEMs were able to successfully compete with uninfected males in cages, inseminating an equivalent number of females (about 25%). Under semi-field conditions, the ability of FEMs to search for and inseminate females was also equivalent to uninfected males (both inseminating about 40% females); but for the remaining females that were not inseminated, evidence of tarsal contact (transfer of fluorescent dust) was significantly greater in FEMs compared to controls. The estimated conidia load of a female exposed on the 5th copulation was 5,200 mL(-1) which was sufficient to cause mortality. Conclusion/Significance Our study is the first to demonstrate auto-dissemination of M. anisopliae through transfer of fungus from males to female Ae. aegypti during mating under semi-field conditions. Our results suggest that auto-dissemination studies using releases of FEMs inside households could successfully infect wild Ae. aegypti females, providing another viable biological control tool for this important the dengue vector.","[Garza-Hernandez, Javier A.; Reyes-Villanueva, Filiberto; Rodriguez-Perez, Mario A.] Inst Politecn Nacl, Lab Biomed Mol, Ctr Biotecnol Genom, Tamaulipas, Mexico; [Russell, Tanya L.] James Cook Univ, Fac Med Hlth & Mol Sci, Cairns, Qld, Australia; [Braks, Marieta A.

However, few studies have looked into the epidemiology, vectors and transmission risks in this region. In this study we describe the triatomine household infestation in Loja province, determine the rate of Trypanosoma cruzi infection in triatomines and study the risk factors associated with infestation. Methodology/Principal Findings An entomological survey found four triatomine species (Rhodnius ecuadoriensis, Triatoma carrioni, Panstrongylus chinai, and P. rufotuberculatus) infesting domiciles in 68% of the 92 rural communities examined. Nine percent of domiciles were infested, and nymphs were observed in 80% of the infested domiciles. Triatomines were found in all ecological regions below 2,200 masl. We found R. ecuadoriensis (275 to 1948 masl) and T. carrioni (831 to 2242 masl) mostly in bedrooms within the domicile, and they were abundant in chicken coops near the domicile. Established colonies of P. chinai (175 to 2003 masl) and P. rufotuberculatus (404 to 1613 masl) also were found in the domicile. Triatomine infestation was associated with surrogate poverty indicators, such as poor sanitary infrastructure (lack of latrine/toilet [w = 0.95], sewage to environment [w = 1.0]). Vegetation type was a determinant of infestation [w = 1.0] and vector control program insecticide spraying was a protective factor [w = 1.0]. Of the 754 triatomines analyzed, 11% were infected with Trypanosoma cruzi and 2% were infected with T. rangeli. Conclusions/Significance To date, only limited vector control efforts have been implemented. Together with recent reports of widespread sylvatic triatomine infestation and frequent post-intervention reinfestation, these results show that an estimated 100,000 people living in rural areas of southern Ecuador are at high risk for T. cruzi infection. Therefore, there is a need for a systematic, sustained, and monitored vector control intervention that is coupled with improvement of socio-economic conditions.","[Grijalva, Mario J.; Ocana-Mayorga, Sofia] Ohio Univ, Trop Dis Inst, Dept Biomed Sci, Heritage Coll Osteopath Med, Athens, OH 45701 USA; [Grijalva, Mario J.; Villacis, Anita G.; Ocana-Mayorga, Sofia; Yumiseva, Cesar A.; Moncayo, Ana L.; Baus, Esteban G.] Pontifical Catholic Univ Ecuador, Ctr Infect & Chron Dis Res, Sch Biol Sci, Quito, Ecuador","Grijalva, MJ (reprint author), Ohio Univ, Trop Dis Inst, Dept Biomed Sci, Heritage Coll Osteopath Med, Athens, OH 45701 USA.",grijalva@ohio.edu,"Grijalva, Mario J/U-8356-2018","Grijalva, Mario J/0000-0003-1964-1425; Ocana-Mayorga, Sofia/0000-0003-3861-9784; Moncayo, Ana/0000-0003-3592-7503; Baus, Esteban/0000-0001-7787-9883; Yumiseva, Cesar/0000-0002-2857-3922","UNICEF/UNPD/World Bank/WHO Special Programme for Research and Training in Tropical Diseases (TDR) [A20785]; Pan American Health Organization [A60655]; National Chagas Control Program-Ecuadorian Ministry of Health, Pontifical Catholic University of Ecuador; Plan Internacional Ecuador; Childrens Heartlink USA; Division of Microbiology and Infectious Diseases, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health (DMID/NIADID/NIH) [AI077896-01]","This work received financial support from the UNICEF/UNPD/World Bank/WHO Special Programme for Research and Training in Tropical Diseases (TDR) [A20785], Pan American Health Organization [A60655], the National Chagas Control Program-Ecuadorian Ministry of Health, Pontifical Catholic University of Ecuador [http://www.puce.edu.ec], Plan Internacional Ecuador [http://www.plan.org.ec/], Childrens Heartlink USA [http://www.childrensheartlink.org/] and the Division of Microbiology and Infectious Diseases, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health (DMID/NIADID/NIH) [AI077896-01].

Therefore, the disease remains heavily neglected in Mozambique, and no recent study has been conducted. Methods Between January and September 2013, acute febrile patients with no other evident cause of fever and attending a health center in a suburban area of Maputo city, Mozambique, were consecutively invited to participate. Paired acute and convalescent serum samples were requested from each participant. Convalescent samples were initially screened for anti-CHIKV IgG using a commercial indirect immunofluorescence test, and if positive, the corresponding acute sample was screened using the same test. Results Four hundred patients were enrolled. The median age of study participants was 26 years (IQR: 21-33 years) and 57.5% (224/391) were female. Paired blood samples were obtained from 209 patients, of which 26.4% (55/208) were presented anti-CHIKV IgG antibodies in the convalescent sample. Seroconversion or a four-fold titer rise was confirmed in 9 (4.3%) patients. Conclusion The results of this study strongly suggest that CHIKV is circulating in southern Mozambique. We recommend that CHIKV should be considered in the differential diagnosis of acute febrile illness in Mozambique and that systematic surveillance for CHIKV should be implemented.","[Gudo, Eduardo Samo; Pinto, Gabriela; Mandlaze, Arcildo; Muianga, Argentina Felisbela] Minist Hlth, Natl Inst Hlth, Maputo, Mozambique; [Vene, Sirkka; Falk, Kerstin] Publ Hlth Agcy Sweden, Stockholm, Sweden; [Cliff, Julie] Eduardo Mondlane Univ, Fac Med, Maputo, Mozambique; [Falk, Kerstin] Karolinska Inst, Stockholm, Sweden","Gudo, ES (reprint author), Minist Hlth, Natl Inst Hlth, Maputo, Mozambique.",esamogudojr@gmail.com,,,European Foundation Initiative for Nelgected Tropical Disease,"ESG received funds from European Foundation Initiative for Nelgected Tropical Disease, http://www.ntd-africa.net.

Although Monkeypox virus (MPXV) and monkeypox disease in humans have been well characterized, little is known about its natural history, or its maintenance in animal populations of sylvatic reservoir(s). In 2003, several species of rodents imported from Ghana were involved in a monkeypox outbreak in the United States with individuals of three African rodent genera (Cricetomys, Graphiurus, Funisciurus) shown to be infected with MPXV. Here, we examine the course of MPXV infection in Cricetomys gambianus (pouched Gambian rats) and this rodent species' competence as a host for the virus. We obtained ten Gambian rats from an introduced colony in Grassy Key, Florida and infected eight of these via scarification with a challenge dose of 4X10(4) plaque forming units (pfu) from either of the two primary clades of MPXV: Congo Basin (C-MPXV: n = 4) or West African (W-MPXV: n = 4); an additional 2 animals served as PBS controls. Viral shedding and the effect of infection on activity and physiological aspects of the animals were measured. MPXV challenged animals had significantly higher core body temperatures, reduced activity and increased weight loss than PBS controls. Viable virus was found in samples taken from animals in both experimental groups (C-MPXV and W-MPXV) between 3 and 27 days post infection (p.i.) (up to 1X10(8) pfu/ml), with viral DNA found until day 56 p.i. The results from this work show that Cricetomys gambianus (and by inference, probably the closely related species, Cricetomys emini) can be infected with MPXV and shed viable virus particles; thus suggesting that these animals may be involved in the maintenance of MPXV in wildlife mammalian populations. More research is needed to elucidate the epidemiology of MPXV and the role of Gambian rats and other species.","[Hutson, Christina L.; Nakazawa, Yoshinori J.; Self, Joshua; Olson, Victoria A.; Regnery, Russell L.; Braden, Zachary; Weiss, Sonja; Karem, Kevin L.; Damon, Inger K.; Carroll, Darin S.] Ctr Dis Control & Prevent, Poxvirus & Rabies Branch, Atlanta, GA USA; [Malekani, Jean] Univ Kinshasa, Dept Biol, Kinshasa, DEM REP CONGO; [Jackson, Eddie; Tate, Mallory] Ctr Dis Control & Prevent, Anim Resources Branch, Atlanta, GA USA; [Rocke, Tonie E.] US Geol Survey, Natl Wildlife Hlth Ctr, Madison, WI USA; [Osorio, Jorge E.] Univ Wisconsin, Sch Vet Med, Dept Pathobiol Sci, Madison, WI 53706 USA","Hutson, CL (reprint author), Ctr Dis Control & Prevent, Poxvirus & Rabies Branch, Atlanta, GA USA.",zuu6@cdc.gov,,"Rocke, Tonie/0000-0003-3933-1563",National Institutes of Health (NIH) [1R01TW008859-01],"This research was supported by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) grant 1R01TW008859-01 (""Sylvatic Reservoirs of Human Monkeypox"").

Methodology This Phase IIIb, open-label, multi-center, single-arm trial assessed the efficacy and safety of PMIM administered at 11 mg/kg (paromomycin base) intramuscularly once daily for 21 consecutive days to children and adults with VL in a rural outpatient setting in Bangladesh. Patients >= 5 and <= 55 years were eligible if they had signs and symptoms of VL (intermittent fever, weight loss/decreased appetite, and enlarged spleen), positive rK39 test, and were living in VL-endemic areas. Compliance was the percentage of enrolled patients who received 21 daily injections over no more than 22 days. Efficacy was evaluated by initial clinical response, defined as resolution of fever and reduction of splenomegaly at end of treatment, and final clinical response, defined as the absence of new clinical signs and symptoms of VL 6 months after end of treatment. Safety was assessed by evaluation of adverse events. Principal Findings A total of 120 subjects (49% pediatric) were enrolled. Treatment compliance was 98.3%. Initial clinical response in the Intent-to-Treat population was 98.3%, and final clinical response 6 months after end of treatment was 94.2%. Of the 119 subjects who received >= 1 dose of PMIM, 28.6% reported at least one adverse event. Injection site pain was the most commonly reported adverse event. Reversible renal impairment and/or hearing loss were reported in 2 subjects. Conclusions/Significance PMIM was an effective and safe treatment for VL in Bangladesh. The short treatment duration and lower cost of PMIM compared with other treatment options may make this drug a preferred treatment to be investigated as part of a combination therapy regimen.

Although the viral RNA was detected in free-living and parasitic ticks, the vector for SFTSV remains unsettled. Methodology/Principal Findings Firstly, an experimental infection study in goats was conducted in a bio-safety level-2 (BSL-2) facility to investigate virus transmission between animals. The results showed that infected animals did not shed virus to the outside through respiratory or digestive tract route, and the control animals did not get infected. Then, a natural infection study was carried out in the SFTSV endemic region. A cohort of naive goats was used as sentinel animals in the study site. A variety of daily samples including goat sera, ticks and mosquitoes were collected for viral RNA and antibody (from serum only) detection, and virus isolation. We detected viral RNA from free-living and parasitic ticks rather than mosquitoes, and from goats after ticks' infestation. We also observed sero-conversion in all members of the animal cohort subsequently. The S segment sequences of the two recovered viral isolates from one infected goat and its parasitic ticks showed a 100% homology at the nucleic acid level. Conclusions/Significance In our natural infection study, close contact between goats does not appear to transmit SFTSV, however, the naive animals were infected after ticks' infestation and two viral isolates derived from an infected goat and its parasitic ticks shared 100% of sequence identity.These data demonstrate that the etiologic agent for goat cohort's natural infection comes from environmental factors. Of these, ticks, especially the predominant species Haemaphysalis longicornis, probably act as vector for this pathogen. The findings in this study may help local health authorities formulate and focus preventive measures to contain this infection.","[Jiao, Yongjun; Qi, Xian; Liu, Dapeng; Zeng, Xiaoyan; Guo, Xiling; Shi, Zhiyang; Wang, Hua; Zhou, Minghao] Minist Hlth, Inst Pathogen Microbiol, Jiangsu Prov Ctr Dis Prevent & Control, Key Lab Enter Pathogen Microbiol, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Han, Yewu] Xuyi Cty Ctr Dis Prevent & Control, Huaian, Peoples R China","Jiao, YJ (reprint author), Minist Hlth, Inst Pathogen Microbiol, Jiangsu Prov Ctr Dis Prevent & Control, Key Lab Enter Pathogen Microbiol, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",zmh@jscdc.cn,,,Jiangsu Science and Technology Department (Jiangsu Province community development project) [BE2012768]; Jiangsu Provincial Commission of Health and Family Planning (Jiangsu Province Outstanding Medical Academic Leader Program) [RC2011082]; Ministry of Science and Technology People's Republic of China (National Mega-Project for Infectious Diseases) [2013ZX09102029]; National Natural Science Foundation [31570926],"For the financial support of this study, YJ received funding from Jiangsu Science and Technology Department (Jiangsu Province community development project, BE2012768. www.jstd.gov.cn); Jiangsu Provincial Commission of Health and Family Planning (Jiangsu Province Outstanding Medical Academic Leader Program, RC2011082, www.jswst.gov.cn); Ministry of Science and Technology People's Republic of China (National Mega-Project for Infectious Diseases, 2013ZX09102029, www.most.gov.cn); and National Natural Science Foundation grant number 31570926.

At a global level, the efforts against LF are designed as an elimination program. However, current efforts appear to aim for elimination in some but not all endemic areas. With the 2020 goal of elimination looming, we set out to develop plausible scale-up scenarios to reach global elimination and eradication. We predict the duration of mass drug administration (MDA) necessary to reach local elimination for a variety of transmission archetypes using an existing model of LF transmission, estimate the number of treatments required for each scenario, and consider implications of rapid scale-up. Methodology We have defined four scenarios that differ in their geographic coverage and rate of scale-up. For each scenario, country-specific simulations and calculations were performed that took into account the pre-intervention transmission intensity, the different vector genera, drug regimen, achieved level of population coverage, previous progress toward elimination, and potential programmatic delays due to mapping, operations, and administration. Principal Findings Our results indicate that eliminating LF by 2020 is unlikely. If MDA programs are drastically scaled up and expanded, the final round of MDA for LF eradication could be delivered in 2028 after 4,159 million treatments. However, if the current rate of scale-up is maintained, the final round of MDA to eradicate LF may not occur until 2050. Conclusions/Significance Rapid scale-up of MDA will decrease the amount of time and treatments required to reach LF eradication. It may also propel the program towards success, as the risk of failure is likely to increase with extended program duration.","[Kastner, Randee J.; Stone, Christopher M.; Steinmann, Peter; Tanner, Marcel; Tediosi, Fabrizio] Swiss Trop & Publ Hlth Inst, Dept Epidemiol & Publ Hlth, Basel, Switzerland; [Kastner, Randee J.; Stone, Christopher M.; Steinmann, Peter; Tanner, Marcel; Tediosi, Fabrizio] Univ Basel, Basel, Switzerland","Kastner, RJ (reprint author), Swiss Trop & Publ Hlth Inst, Dept Epidemiol & Publ Hlth, Basel, Switzerland.",fabrizio.tediosi@unibas.ch,"Tediosi, Fabrizio/L-1505-2015","Tediosi, Fabrizio/0000-0001-8671-9400; Stone, Christopher/0000-0001-9535-2583","Eradication Investment Case (EIC) of Onchocheriasis, Lymphatic Filariasis and Human African Trypanosomiasis; Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation (BMGF) [OPP1037660]","This work was funded by Eradication Investment Case (EIC) of Onchocheriasis, Lymphatic Filariasis and Human African Trypanosomiasis, and grant #OPP1037660 of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation (BMGF).

We report the outcomes against scabies of two oral ivermectin mass drug administrations (MDAs) delivered 12 months apart in a remote Australian Aboriginal community. Methods Utilizing a before and after study design, we measured scabies prevalence through population census with sequential MDAs at baseline and month 12. Surveys at months 6 and 18 determined disease acquisition and treatment failures. Scabies infestations were diagnosed clinically with additional laboratory investigations for crusted scabies. Non-pregnant participants weighing >= 15 kg were administered a single 200 mu g/kg ivermectin dose, repeated after 2-3 weeks if scabies was diagnosed, others followed a standard alternative algorithm. Principal Findings We saw > 1000 participants at each population census. Scabies prevalence fell from 4% at baseline to 1% at month 6. Prevalence rose to 9% at month 12 amongst the baseline cohort in association with an identified exposure to a presumptive crusted scabies case with a higher prevalence of 14% amongst new entries to the cohort. At month 18, scabies prevalence fell to 2%. Scabies acquisitions six months after each MDA were 1% and 2% whilst treatment failures were 6% and 5% respectively. Conclusion Scabies prevalence reduced in the six months after each MDA with a low risk of acquisition (1-2%). However, in a setting where living conditions are conducive to high scabies transmissibility, exposure to presumptive crusted scabies and population mobility, a sustained reduction in prevalence was not achieved.","[Kearns, Therese M.; Holt, Deborah C.; Currie, Bart J.; Gundjirryirr, Roslyn; Bundhala, Leanne; Chatfield, Mark; Andrews, Ross M.] Charles Darwin Univ, Menzies Sch Hlth Res, Darwin, NT 0909, Australia; [Speare, Richard] James Cook Univ, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia; [Cheng, Allen C.] Monash Univ, Melbourne, Vic 3004, Australia; [McCarthy, James] QIMR Berghofer Med Res Inst, Brisbane, Qld, Australia; [Carapetis, Jonathan R.] Univ Western Australia, Telethon Kids Inst, Perth, WA 6009, Australia; [Carapetis, Jonathan R.] Princess Margaret Hosp Children, Perth, WA, Australia; [Page, Wendy; Mulholland, Eddie] Miwatj Hlth Aboriginal Corp, Nhulunbuy, Australia; [Shield, Jennifer] La Trobe Univ, Bendigo, Australia","Kearns, TM (reprint author), Charles Darwin Univ, Menzies Sch Hlth Res, Darwin, NT 0909, Australia.",therese.kearns@menzies.edu.au,"Page, Wendy Ann/O-2756-2014; Chatfield, Mark/N-2278-2013; Kearns, Therese/N-2308-2013","Page, Wendy Ann/0000-0002-5669-529X; Chatfield, Mark/0000-0002-0004-6274; Kearns, Therese/0000-0003-0862-7572; McCarthy, James/0000-0001-6596-9718; Cheng, Allen/0000-0003-3152-116X; Speare, Rick/0000-0002-9993-1213","National Health and Medical Research Council [GTN0605804, GNT0545239]; Cooperative Research Centre for Aboriginal Health [HS331]; Northern Territory Research Innovation Board and Fund","This work was supported by National Health and Medical Research Council (GTN0605804 - TMK RS ACC JM JRC DCH BJC WP EM RMA & GNT0545239 - TMK) https://www.nhmrc.gov.au/; Cooperative Research Centre for Aboriginal Health (HS331 - RMA) http://www.lowitja.org.au/; and Northern Territory Research Innovation Board and Fund (Grant round 6-2008 - TMK) http://www.bulletpoint.com.au/northern-territory-research-and-innovation-fund/.

Along with the inclusion of short cycle human-to-human transmission and long cycle human-to-environment and environment-to-human transmission, this novel dynamic model incorporates both the reported cholera incidence and remote sensing data from the Ouest Department of Haiti between 2010 to 2014. The model has separate compartments for infectious individuals that include different levels of infectivity to reflect the distribution of symptomatic and asymptomatic cases in the population. The environmental compartment, which serves as a source of exposure to toxigenic V. cholerae, is also modeled separately based on the biology of causative bacterium, the shedding of V. cholerae O1 by humans into the environment, as well as the effects of precipitation and water temperature on the concentration and survival of V. cholerae in aquatic reservoirs. Although the number of reported cholera cases has declined compared to the initial outbreak in 2010, the increase in the number of susceptible population members and the presence of toxigenic V. cholerae in the environment estimated by the model indicate that without further improvements to drinking water and sanitation infrastructures, intermittent cholera outbreaks are likely to continue in Haiti.","[Kirpich, Alexander; Yang, Yang; Longini, Ira M.] Univ Florida, Dept Biostat, Coll Publ Hlth & Hlth Profess, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; [Kirpich, Alexander; Yang, Yang; Longini, Ira M.] Univ Florida, Coll Med, Gainesville, FL USA; [Kirpich, Alexander; Weppelmann, Thomas A.; Yang, Yang; Ali, Afsar; Morris, J.

During co-infection, interactions between these two species are possible, yet the extent to which such interactions influence disease dynamics or the outcome of control efforts remains poorly understood. Methodology/Principal Findings Here we analyse epidemiological data from three West African countries co-endemic for urogenital and intestinal schistosomiasis (Senegal, Niger and Mali) to test whether the impact of praziquantel (PZQ) treatment, subsequent levels of re-infection or long-term infection dynamics are altered by co-infection. In all countries, positive associations between the two species prevailed at baseline: infection by one species tended to predict infection intensity for the other, with the strength of association varying across sites. Encouragingly, we found little evidence that co-infection influenced PZQ efficacy: species-specific egg reduction rates (ERR) and cure rates (CR) did not differ significantly with co-infection, and variation in treatment success was largely geographical. In Senegal, despite positive associations at baseline, children with S. mansoni co-infection at the time of treatment were less intensely re-infected by S. haematobium than those with single infections, suggesting competition between the species may occur post-treatment. Furthermore, the proportion of schistosome infections attributable to S. mansoni increased over time in all three countries examined. Conclusions/Significance These findings suggest that while co-infection between urinary and intestinal schistosomes may not directly affect PZQ treatment efficacy, competitive interspecific interactions may influence epidemiological patterns of re-infection post-treatment. While re-infection patterns differed most strongly according to geographic location, interspecific interactions also seem to play a role, and could cause the community composition in mixed species settings to shift as disease control efforts intensify, a situation with implications for future disease management in this multi-species system.","[Knowles, Sarah C.

More precisely describing the population biology and reproductive mode of such pests is not only a matter of pure science, but can also be useful for understanding parasite adaptation, as well as how parasitism, specialization (parasite specificity), and complex life cycles evolve over time. Studying this parasite's reproductive strategies and population structure can also contribute key information to the understanding of the epidemiology of associated diseases; it can also provide clues for elaborating control programs and predicting the probability of success for control campaigns (such as vaccines and drug therapies), along with emergence or reemergence risks. Population genetics tools, if appropriately used, can provide precise and useful information in these investigations. In this paper, we revisit recent data collected during population genetics surveys of different Trypanosoma species in sub-Saharan Africa. Reproductive modes and population structure depend not only on the taxon but also on the geographical location and data quality (absence or presence of DNA amplification failures). We conclude on issues regarding future directions of research, in particular vis-a-vis genotyping and sampling strategies, which are still relevant yet, too often, neglected issues.","[Koffi, Mathurin] Univ Jean Lorougnon GUEDE, UFR Environm Sante, Lab Interact Hote Microorganismes Environm & Evol, Daloa, Cote Ivoire; [De Meeus, Thierry; Sere, Modou; Kabore, Jacques; Jamonneau, Vincent] IRD, Ctr Int Rech Dev Elevage Zone Subhumide CIRDES, UMR IRD CIRAD INTERTRYP 177, Bobo Dioulasso, Burkina Faso; [De Meeus, Thierry; Bucheton, Bruno; Solano, Philippe] IRD, CIRAD INTERTRYP UMR177, Montpellier, France; [Bucheton, Bruno; Camara, Mamadou] Programme Natl Lutte Trypanosomiase Humaine Afric, Conakry, Guinea; [Simo, Gustave] Univ Dschang, Fac Sci, Dept Biochem, Dschang, Cameroon; [Njiokou, Flobert] Univ Yaounde I, Fac Sci, Dept Anim Biol & Physiol, Yaounde, Cameroon; [Salim, Bashir] Univ Khartoum, Dept Parasitol, Fac Vet Med, Khartoum, Sudan; [Salim, Bashir] Agr Res Council, Onderstepoort Vet Inst, Parasites Vectors & Vector Borne Dis, Onderstepoort, South Africa; [Kabore, Jacques; Belem, Adrien Marie Gaston] Univ Polytech Bobo Dioulasso, UFR Sci & Tech, Bobo Dioulasso, Burkina Faso; [MacLeod, Annette] Univ Glasgow, Wellcome Ctr Mol Parasitol, Glasgow, Lanark, Scotland","Koffi, M (reprint author), Univ Jean Lorougnon GUEDE, UFR Environm Sante, Lab Interact Hote Microorganismes Environm & Evol, Daloa, Cote Ivoire.",m9koffi@yahoo.fr; thierry.demeeus@ird.fr,"solano, philippe/B-2328-2010; Jamonneau, Vincent/K-1124-2016","solano, philippe/0000-0002-4351-3506; Jamonneau, Vincent/0000-0001-8427-0769","AIRD (Agence Inter-etablissements de Recherche pour le Developpement); IRD (Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement); AIRD-CIRAD, ""Programme Doctorants du Sud"" [772689J]; ANR (Agence Nationale de la Recherche) Clonix project ""Revisiting the Population Genetics and Genomics of clonal organisms"" [ANR-11-566 BSV7-007]","This study was funded by a grant from the PEERS (Programme d'Excellence pour l'Enseignement et la Recherche au Sud) TAO (Trypanosomes et tsetses en Afrique de l'Ouest: apport de la genetique des populations) of the AIRD (Agence Inter-etablissements de Recherche pour le Developpement).

As clinical symptoms are usually non-specific, new diagnostic and prognostic markers are urgently needed to enhance the number of identified cases and optimise treatment. This is particularly important for disease caused by Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense, where indirect immunodiagnostic approaches have to date been unsuccessful. We have conducted global metabolic profiling of plasma from T.b.rhodesiense HAT patients and endemic controls, using H-1 nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and ultra-performance liquid chromatography, coupled with mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS) and identified differences in the lipid, amino acid and metabolite profiles. Altogether 16 significantly disease discriminatory metabolite markers were found using NMR, and a further 37 lipid markers via UPLC-MS. These included significantly higher levels of phenylalanine, formate, creatinine, N-acetylated glycoprotein and triglycerides in patients relative to controls. HAT patients also displayed lower concentrations of histidine, sphingomyelins, lysopho-sphatidylcholines, and several polyunsaturated phosphatidylcholines. While the disease metabolite profile was partially consistent with previous data published in experimental rodent infection, we also found unique lipid and amino acid profile markers highlighting subtle but important differences between the host response to trypanosome infections between animal models and natural human infections. Our results demonstrate the potential of metabolic profiling in the identification of novel diagnostic biomarkers and the elucidation of pathogenetic mechanisms in this disease.","[Lamour, Sabrina D.; Vorkas, Panagiotis A.; Saric, Jasmina; Holmes, Elaine] Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Dept Surg & Canc, Div Computat & Syst Med, Sect Biomol Med, London, England; [Gomez-Romero, Maria; Alibu, Vincent P.] Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Dept Med, Sect Hepatol & Gastroenterol, London, England; [Sternberg, Jeremy M.] Univ Aberdeen, Inst Environm & Biol Sci, Aberdeen, Scotland","Lamour, SD (reprint author), Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Dept Surg & Canc, Div Computat & Syst Med, Sect Biomol Med, London, England.",j.sternberg@abdn.ac.uk,,"Vorkas, Panagiotis/0000-0002-3523-0936; Gomez Romero, Maria/0000-0003-4884-7721; Sternberg, Jeremy/0000-0002-1596-3622",Wellcome Trust [082786]; MRC Doctoral Training Award [G1000390]; Medical Research Council [1248541],"JMS and VPA were supported by a Wellcome Trust (www.wellcome.ac.uk) project grant 082786.

It occurs in many parts of the world where pastoral activities predominate, including the Rio Negro province of Argentina. Although CE control activities have been undertaken in the western regions of Rio Negro for more than two decades, the disease continues to remain prevalent in both the human and livestock animal populations. Vaccination of animal intermediate hosts of CE with the EG95 vaccine may provide a new opportunity to improve the effectiveness of CE control measures, although data are lacking about field application of the vaccine. Aims Evaluate the impact of EG95 vaccination in sheep on the transmission of Echinococcus granulosus in a field environment. Methodology Two trial sites were established in western Rio Negro province within indigenous communities. Vaccination of lambs born into one trial site was introduced and continued for 6 years. Prior to initiation of the trial, and at the end of the trial, the prevalence of CE in sheep was determined by necropsy. Weaned lambs received two injections of EG95 vaccine, approximately one month apart, and a single booster injection one year later. Vaccination was not implemented at the second trial site. A total of 2725 animals were vaccinated in the first year. Animals from this cohort as well as age-matched sheep from the control area were evaluated by necropsy. Key results Introduction of the vaccine led to a statistically significant in the number and size of hydatid cysts in comparison to the situation prior to the introduction of the vaccine, or compared to CE prevalence in the control area where the vaccine was not applied. The prevalence of infection in the vaccinated area was also significantly reduced by 62% compared to the re-intervention level, being lower than the prevalence seen in the control area, although the difference from the control area after the intervention was not significant possibly due to limitations in the numbers of animals available for necropsy. Conclusions Vaccination of sheep with the EG95 vaccine provides a valuable new tool which improves the effectiveness of CE control activities. Vaccination was effective even in a difficult, remote environment where only approximately half the lambs born into the communities were fully vaccinated.","[Larrieu, Edmundo; Garcia Cachau, Mariela; Lamberti, Roberto; Gino, Lilia] Univ Nacl La Pampa, Fac Ciencias Vet, Gen Pico, Argentina; [Larrieu, Edmundo; Crowley, Pablo] Univ Nacl Rio Negro, Escuela Vet, Choele Choel, Argentina; [Mujica, Guillermo; Seleiman, Marcos; Herrero, Eduardo; Luis Labanchi, Jose; Araya, Daniel; Sepulveda, Luis; Grizmado, Claudia; Calabro, Arnoldo; Talmon, Gabriel] Minist Salud, Viedma, Provincia De Ri, Argentina; [Gauci, Charles G.; Donadeu, Meritxell; Lightowlers, Marshall W.] Univ Melbourne, Fac Vet & Agr Sci, Werribee, Vic, Australia; [Vizcaychipi, Katherina; Cespedes, Graciela; Santillan, Graciela] INEI ANLIS, Dept Parasitol, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [Veronica Poggio, Thelma] Cesar Milstein CONICET, Inst Ciencia & Tecnol, Ctr Virol Anim CEVAN, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina","Larrieu, E (reprint author), Univ Nacl La Pampa, Fac Ciencias Vet, Gen Pico, Argentina.",ejlarrieu@hotmail.com,,"Gauci, Charles/0000-0001-5097-2164",National University of La Pampa [089/ 2013],"Research project approved and funded by the National University of La Pampa (Resolution 089/ 2013).

However, the real CE epidemiological situation is not well established. In fact, it is possible that CE is a re-emerging disease due to the weakness of current control programs. Methodology We performed a retrospective observational study of inpatients diagnosed with CE from January 2000 to December 2012 in the Western Spain Public Health-Care System. Principal findings During the study period, 5510 cases of CE were diagnosed and 3161 (57.4%) of the cases were males. The age mean and standard deviation were 67.8 +/- 16.98 years old, respectively, and 634 patients (11.5%) were younger than 45 years old. A total of 1568 patients (28.5%) had CE as the primary diagnosis, and it was most frequently described in patients <45 years old. Futhermore, a secondary diagnosis of CE was usually found in patients >70 year old associated with other causes of comorbidity. The period incidence rate was 17 cases per 105 person-years and was significantly higher when compared to the incidence declared through the Notifiable Disease System (1.88 cases per 10(5) person-years; p<0.001). Conclusions CE in western Spain is an underestimated parasitic disease. It has an active transmission, with an occurrence in pediatric cases, but has decreased in the recent years. The systematic search of Hospital Discharge Records of the National Health System Register (HDR) may be a more accurate method than other methods for the estimation of the incidence of CE in endemic areas.","[Lopez-Bernus, Amparo; Carpio-Perez, Adela; Velasco-Tirado, Virginia; Romero-Alegria, Angela] IBSAL, Med Interna Serv, CAUSA, CIETUS, Salamanca, Spain; [Belhassen-Garcia, Moncef; Cordero-Sanchez, Miguel] IBSAL, Med Interna Serv, Secc Enfermedades Infecciosas, CAUSA,CIETUS, Salamanca, Spain; [Alonso-Sardon, Montserrat] Univ Salamanca, Area Med Prevent & Salud Publ, CIETUS, IBSAL, E-37008 Salamanca, Spain; [Muro, Antonio] Univ Salamanca, Lab Inmunol Parasitaria & Mol, CIETUS, IBSAL,Fac Farm, E-37008 Salamanca, Spain; [Pardo-Lledias, Javier] CAUPA Hosp Gen Palencia Rio Carrion, Med Interna Serv, Palencia, Spain","Lopez-Bernus, A (reprint author), IBSAL, Med Interna Serv, CAUSA, CIETUS, Salamanca, Spain.",mbelhassen@hotmail.com,"Alonso-Sardon, Montserrat/E-2185-2018","Belhassen-Garcia, Moncef/0000-0002-2230-1256; Muro, Antonio/0000-0003-0244-4740; Velasco Tirado, Virginia/0000-0001-7175-1758",,,,22,9,9,0,0,PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE,SAN FRANCISCO,"1160 BATTERY STREET, STE 100, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94111 USA",1935-2735,,,PLOS NEGLECT TROP D,Plos Neglect.

Although the Leishmania parasite modulates macrophage functions to ensure its survival, what remains an unanswered yet pertinent question is whether these macrophages are deactivated or alternatively activated. This study aimed to characterize the functional plasticity and polarization of monocytes/macrophages and delineate their importance in the immunopathogenesis of Post kala-azar dermal leishmaniasis (PKDL), a chronic dermatosis of human leishmaniasis. Monocytes from PKDL patients showed a decreased expression of TLR-2/4, along with an attenuated generation of reactive oxidative/nitrosative species. At disease presentation, an increased mRNA expression of classical M2 markers CD206, ARG1 and PPARG in monocytes and lesional macrophages indicated M2 polarization of macrophages which was corroborated by increased expression of CD206 and arginase-1. Furthermore, altered vitamin D signaling was a key feature in PKDL, as disease presentation was associated with raised plasma levels of monohydroxylated vitamin D-3 and vitamin D3-associated genes, features of M2 polarization. Taken together, in PKDL, monocyte/macrophage subsets appear to be alternatively activated, a phenotype that might sustain disease chronicity. Importantly, repolarization of these monocytes to M1 by antileishmanial drugs suggests that switching from M2 to M1 phenotype might represent a therapeutic opportunity, worthy of future pharmacological consideration.","[Mukhopadhyay, Debanjan; Mukherjee, Shibabrata; Roy, Susmita; Kundu, Sunanda; Sarkar, Avijit; Chatterjee, Mitali] Postgrad Inst Med Educ & Res, Dept Pharmacol, Kolkata, W Bengal, India; [Dalton, Jane E.; Kaye, Paul M.] Univ York, Hull York Med Sch, Ctr Immunol & Infect, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England; [Dalton, Jane E.; Kaye, Paul M.] Univ York, Dept Biol, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England; [Das, Nilay K.] Calcutta Med Coll, Dept Dermatol, Kolkata, W Bengal, India","Mukhopadhyay, D (reprint author), Postgrad Inst Med Educ & Res, Dept Pharmacol, Kolkata, W Bengal, India.",paul.kaye@york.ac.uk; ilatim@vsnl.net,"Mukhopadhyay, Debanjan/S-3347-2019","Mukhopadhyay, Debanjan/0000-0002-8921-4106; Kaye, Paul/0000-0002-8796-4755; Mukherjee, Shibabrata/0000-0003-1654-091X; Dalton, Jane/0000-0001-9115-8855","Indian Council of Medical Research, Govt. of India [5/8-7(250)2012-ECD-II]; Council of Scientific & Industrial Research, Govt. of India [27 (0227)/10/EMR-II]; UK Medical Research Council [G1000230]; Medical Research Council [G1000230]","This work was supported by: Indian Council of Medical Research, Govt. of India (5/8-7(250)2012-ECD-II (MC), Council of Scientific & Industrial Research, Govt. of India (27 (0227)/10/EMR-II (MC), UK Medical Research Council G1000230 (PMK).

Animal reservoirs of Tunga penetrans differ among endemic areas and their role in the epidemiology of tungiasis had never been investigated in Uganda. Methods and Findings To identify the major animal reservoirs of Tunga penetrans and their relative importance in the transmission of tungiasis in Uganda, a cross sectional study was conducted in animal rearing households in 10 endemic villages in Bugiri District. T. penetrans infections were detected in pigs, dogs, goats and a cat. The prevalences of households with tungiasis ranged from 0% to 71.4% (median 22.2) for animals and from 5 to 71.4% (median 27.8%) for humans. The prevalence of human tungiasis also varied among the population of the villages (median 7%, range 1.3-37.3%). Pig infections had the widest distribution (nine out of 10 villages) and highest prevalence (median 16.2%, range 0-64.1%). Pigs also had a higher number of embedded sand fleas than all other species combined (p<0.0001). Dog tungiasis occurred in five out of 10 villages with low prevalences (median of 2%, range 0-26.9%). Only two goats and a single cat had tungiasis. Prevalences of animal and human tungiasis correlated at both village (rho = 0.89, p = 0.0005) and household (rho = 0.4, p<0.0001) levels. The median number of lesions in household animals correlated with the median intensity of infection in children three to eight years of age (rho = 0.47, p<0.0001). Animal tungiasis increased the odds of occurrence of human cases in households six fold (OR = 6.1, 95% CI 3.3-11.4, p<0.0001). Conclusion Animal and human tungiasis were closely associated and pigs were identified as the most important animal hosts of T. penetrans. Effective tungiasis control should follow One Health principles and integrate ectoparasites control in animals.","[Mutebi, Francis; Waiswa, Charles] Makerere Univ, Sch Vet Med & Anim Resources, Coll Vet Med Anim Resources & Biosecur, Kampala, Uganda; [Kruecken, Juergen; von Samson-Himmelstjerna, Georg] Free Univ Berlin, Inst Parasitol & Trop Vet Med, Berlin, Germany; [Feldmeier, Hermann] Charite, Inst Microbiol & Hyg, Campus Benjamin Franklin, D-13353 Berlin, Germany; [Mencke, Norbert] Bayer Anim Hlth, Leverkusen, Germany; [Sentongo, Elizabeth] Makerere Univ, Sch Biomed Sci, Dept Med Microbiol, Coll Hlth Sci, Kampala, Uganda","Mutebi, F (reprint author), Makerere Univ, Sch Vet Med & Anim Resources, Coll Vet Med Anim Resources & Biosecur, Kampala, Uganda.",juergen.kruecken@fu-berlin.de,"von Samson, Georg/R-1123-2016; Krucken, Jurgen/B-6794-2009","Krucken, Jurgen/0000-0002-2842-8100",German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD); Bayer,"The present study was performed as a collaborative research project between Bayer Animal Health, Makarere University and the Institute of Parasitology and Tropical Veterinary Medicine, Freie Universitat Berlin.

The model quantitatively addresses the geographic stratification of disease burden in a novel framework by explicitly accounting for drivers and controls of the disease, including spatial information on the distributions of population and infrastructure, jointly with a general description of human mobility and climatic/ecological drivers. Spatial patterns of disease are analysed by the extraction and the mapping of suitable eigenvectors of the Jacobian matrix subsuming the stability of the disease-free equilibrium. The relevance of the work lies in the novel mapping of disease burden, a byproduct of the parametrization induced by regional upscaling, by model-guided field validations and in the predictive scenarios allowed by exploiting the range of possible parameters and processes. Human mobility is found to be a primary control at regional scales both for pathogen invasion success and the overall distribution of disease burden. The effects of water resources development highlighted by systematic reviews are accounted for by the average distances of human settlements from water bodies that are habitats for the parasite's intermediate host. Our results confirm the empirical findings about the role of water resources development on disease spread into regions previously nearly disease-free also by inspection of empirical prevalence patterns. We conclude that while the model still needs refinements based on field and epidemiological evidence, the proposed framework provides a powerful tool for large-scale public health planning and schistosomiasis management.","[Perez-Saez, Javier; Bertuzzo, Enrico; Mande, Theophile; Ceperley, Natalie; Froehlich, Jean-Marc; Rinaldo, Andrea] Ecole Polytech Fed Lausanne, Lab Ecohydrol, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland; [Mari, Lorenzo; Casagrandi, Renato; Gatto, Marino] Politecn Milan, Dipartimento Elettron Informaz & Bioingn, I-20133 Milan, Italy; [Sokolow, Susanne H.; De Leo, Giulio A.] Stanford Univ, Hopkins Marine Stn, Pacific Grove, CA 93950 USA; [Sokolow, Susanne H.] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Inst Marine Sci, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA; [De Leo, Giulio A.] Stanford Univ, Woods Inst Environm, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Sou, Mariam; Karambiri, Harouna; Yacouba, Hamma; Maiga, Amadou] Inst Int Ingn Eau & Environm, Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso; [Rinaldo, Andrea] Univ Padua, Dipartimento ICEA, Padua, Italy","Perez-Saez, J (reprint author), Ecole Polytech Fed Lausanne, Lab Ecohydrol, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland.",andrea.rinaldo@epfl.ch,"Bertuzzo, Enrico/U-7129-2017; Ceperley, Natalie Claire/F-3962-2016; Mari, Lorenzo/M-8528-2015; Gatto, Marino/D-9531-2012; Perez-Saez, Francisco Javier/I-9775-2014; Casagrandi, Renato/L-3985-2013","Bertuzzo, Enrico/0000-0001-5872-0666; Ceperley, Natalie Claire/0000-0002-2260-8426; Mari, Lorenzo/0000-0003-1326-9992; Gatto, Marino/0000-0001-8063-9178; Perez-Saez, Francisco Javier/0000-0003-3909-2048; Mande, Theophile/0000-0002-0015-884X; Casagrandi, Renato/0000-0001-5177-803X; Sokolow, Susanne/0000-0002-5111-9322","Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation - 2iE partie scientifique - through ""Projet 3E Afrique, Burkina Faso""; Stanford FSI & SEED's GDP Initiative; NSF CNH [1414102]; NIH EEID [1R01TW010286-01]; Woods Institute's Environmental Venture Projects at Stanford University (EVP)","Funding provided by the Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation - 2iE partie scientifique - through ""Projet 3E Afrique, Burkina Faso"" is gratefully acknowledged.

DF cases were clustered in the Pearl River Delta economic zone (PRD) in Guangdong Province, which accounted for 99.6% of all cases in Guangdong province in 2013. The main vector in PRD was Aedes albopictus. We investigated the socioeconomic and environmental factors at the township level and explored how the independent variables jointly affect the DF epidemic in the PRD. Methodology/Principal Findings Six factors associated with the incidence of DF were identified in this project, representing the urbanization, poverty, accessibility and vegetation, and were considered to be core contributors to the occurrence of DF from the perspective of the social economy and the environment. Analyses were performed with Generalized Additive Models (GAM) to fit parametric and non-parametric functions to the relationships between the response and predictors. We used a spline-smooth technique and plotted the predicted against the observed co-variable value. The distribution of DF cases was over-dispersed and fit the negative binomial function better. The effects of all six socioeconomic and environmental variables were found to be significant at the 0.001 level and the model explained 45.1% of the deviance by DF incidence. There was a higher risk of DF infection among people living at the prefectural boundary or in the urban areas than among those living in other areas in the PRD. The relative risk of living at the prefectural boundary was higher than that of living in the urban areas. The associations between the DF cases and population density, GDP per capita, road density, and NDVI were nonlinear. In general, higher ""road density"" or lower ""GDP per capita"" were considered to be consistent risk factors. Moreover, higher or lower values of ""population density"" and ""NDVI"" could result in an increase in DF cases. Conclusion In this study, we presented an effect analysis of socioeconomic and environmental factors on DF occurrence at the smallest administrative unit (township level) for the first time in China. GAM was used to effectively detect the nonlinear impact of the predictors on the outcome. The results showed that the relative importance of different risk factors may vary across the PRD. This work improves our understanding of the differences and effects of socioeconomic and environmental factors on DF and supports effectively targeted prevention and control measures.","[Qi, Xiaopeng; Li, Yue; Meng, Yujie; Chen, Qianqian; Ma, Jiaqi] Chinese Ctr Dis Control & Prevent, Natl Ctr Publ Hlth Surveillance & Informat Serv, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Wang, Yong] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, State Key Lab Resources & Environm Informat Syst, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Gao, George F.] Chinese Ctr Dis Control & Prevent, Off Director, Beijing, Peoples R China","Qi, XP (reprint author), Chinese Ctr Dis Control & Prevent, Natl Ctr Publ Hlth Surveillance & Informat Serv, Beijing, Peoples R China.",qixp@chinacdc.cn; gaofu@chinacdc.cn,,,National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program) [2012CB955504]; High Resolution Earth Observation Systems of National Science and Technology Major Projects [10-Y30B11-9001-14/16]; Chinese Ministry of Science and Technology [2012 ZX10004201-011],"This study was supported in part by National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program) (2012CB955504), the High Resolution Earth Observation Systems of National Science and Technology Major Projects (10-Y30B11-9001-14/16) and the Chinese Ministry of Science and Technology (2012 ZX10004201-011).

Patients are mainly immigrants from various endemic countries or living in French overseas territories. We aimed at expanding data regarding the geographical distribution of the SNP genotypes of the M. leprae isolates from these patients. Methodology/Principal findings Skin biopsies were obtained from 71 leprosy patients diagnosed between January 2009 and December 2013. Data regarding age, sex and place of birth and residence were also collected. Diagnosis of leprosy was confirmed by microscopic detection of acid-fast bacilli and/or amplification by PCR of the M. leprae-specific RLEP region. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP), present in the M. leprae genome at positions 14 676, 1 642 875 and 2 935 685, were determined with an efficiency of 94% (67/71). Almost all patients were from countries other than France where leprosy is still prevalent (n = 31) or from French overseas territories (n = 36) where leprosy is not totally eradicated, while only a minority (n = 4) was born in metropolitan France but have lived in other countries. SNP type 1 was predominant (n = 33), followed by type 3 (n = 17), type 4 (n = 11) and type 2 (n = 6). SNP types were concordant with those previously reported as prevalent in the patients' countries of birth. SNP types found in patients born in countries other than France (Comoros, Haiti, Benin, Congo, Sri Lanka) and French overseas territories (French Polynesia, Mayotte and La Reunion) not covered by previous work correlated well with geographical location and history of human settlements. Conclusions/Significance The phylogenic analysis of M. leprae strains isolated in France strongly suggests that French leprosy cases are caused by SNP types that are (a) concordant with the geographic origin or residence of the patients (non-French countries, French overseas territories, metropolitan France) or (b) more likely random in regions where diverse migration flows occurred.","[Reibel, Florence; Chauffour, Aurelie; Brossier, Florence; Jarlier, Vincent; Aubry, Alexandra] Univ Paris 06, Sorbonne Univ, Paris, France; [Reibel, Florence; Chauffour, Aurelie; Brossier, Florence; Jarlier, Vincent; Aubry, Alexandra] INSERM, U1135, Immun & Infect Dis Ctr Cimi Paris, Team 13, Paris, France; [Reibel, Florence; Chauffour, Aurelie; Brossier, Florence; Jarlier, Vincent; Aubry, Alexandra] Hop La Pitie Salpetriere, AP HP, Natl Reference Ctr Mycobacteria, Bacteriol Lab, Paris, France; [Cambau, Emmanuelle] Univ Paris Diderot, IAME, UMR 1137, Sorbonne Paris Cite, Paris, France; [Cambau, Emmanuelle] Lariboisiere St Louis Fernand Widal Hosp, Lab Bacteriol Virol, AP HP, Paris, France; [Cambau, Emmanuelle] INSERM, IAME, UMR 1137, Paris, France","Reibel, F (reprint author), Univ Paris 06, Sorbonne Univ, Paris, France.",alexandra.aubry@upmc.fr,"Brossier, Florence/N-9893-2016; Aubry, Alexandra/F-8783-2014; Aubry, Alexandra/O-3303-2019","Aubry, Alexandra/0000-0003-4230-4793; Aubry, Alexandra/0000-0003-4230-4793",Institut National de Veille Sanitaire; Association Francaise Raoul Follereau,"Funding support for the study was provided by an annual grant of the Institut National de Veille Sanitaire supporting the French National Reference Center for Mycobacteria and repeated annual grants from the Association Francaise Raoul Follereau.

Therefore, optimising visual baits to control tsetse is an important priority. Tsetse are intercepted at visual baits due to their initial attraction to the bait, and their subsequent contact with it due to landing or accidental collision. Attraction is proposed to be driven in part by a chromatic mechanism to which a UV-blue photoreceptor contributes positively, and a UV and a green photoreceptor contribute negatively. Landing responses are elicited by stimuli with low luminance, but many studies also find apparently strong landing responses when stimuli have high UV reflectivity, which would imply that UV wavelengths contribute negatively to attraction at a distance, but positively to landing responses at close range. The strength of landing responses is often judged using the number of tsetse sampled at a cloth panel expressed as a proportion of the combined catch of the cloth panel and a flanking net that samples circling flies. I modelled these data from two previously published field studies, using calculated fly photoreceptor excitations as predictors. I found that the proportion of tsetse caught on the cloth panel increased with an index representing the chromatic mechanism driving attraction, as would be expected if the same mechanism underlay both long-and close-range attraction. However, the proportion of tsetse caught on the cloth panel also increased with excitation of the UV-sensitive R7p photoreceptor, in an apparently separate but interacting behavioural mechanism. This R7p-driven effect resembles the fly open-space response which is believed to underlie their dispersal towards areas of open sky. As such, the proportion of tsetse that contact a cloth panel likely reflects a combination of deliberate landings by potentially host-seeking tsetse, and accidental collisions by those seeking to disperse, with a separate visual mechanism underlying each behaviour.","Aberystwyth Univ, Inst Biol Environm & Rural Sci, Aberystwyth, Ceredigion, Wales","Santer, RD (reprint author), Aberystwyth Univ, Inst Biol Environm & Rural Sci, Aberystwyth, Ceredigion, Wales.",rds5@aber.ac.uk,,,,,,49,2,2,0,7,PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE,SAN FRANCISCO,"1160 BATTERY STREET, STE 100, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94111 USA",1935-2735,,,PLOS NEGLECT TROP D,Plos Neglect.

Currently, the immune response and its role in the development of MAYV-induced persistent arthralgia remain unknown. In this study, we evaluated the immune response of individuals with confirmed MAYV infection in a one-year longitudinal study carried out in Loreto, Peru. We report that MAYV infection elicits robust immune responses that result in the development of a strong neutralizing antibody response and the secretion of pro-inflammatory immune mediators. The composition of these inflammatory mediators, in some cases, differed to those previously observed for CHIKV. Key mediators such as IL-13, IL-7 and VEGF were strongly induced following MAYV infection and were significantly increased in subjects that eventually developed persistent arthralgia. Although a strong neutralizing antibody response was observed in all subjects, it was not sufficient to prevent the long-term outcomes of MAYV infection. This study provides initial immunologic insight that may eventually contribute to prognostic tools and therapeutic treatments against this emerging pathogen.","[Santiago, Felix W.; Silvas, Jesus A.; Aguilar, Patricia V.] Inst Human Infect & Immun, Galveston, TX USA; [Santiago, Felix W.; Silvas, Jesus A.; Aguilar, Patricia V.] Univ Texas Med Branch, Dept Pathol, Galveston, TX 77555 USA; [Halsey, Eric S.; Guevara, Carolina; Ampuero, Julia S.] US Naval Med Res Unit 6, Lima, Peru; [Siles, Crystyan; Vilcarromero, Stalin] US Naval Med Res Unit 6, Iquitos, Peru; [Ramal, Cesar] Hosp Reg, Loreto, Peru; [Aguilar, Patricia V.] Ctr Biodef & Emerging Infect Dis, Galveston, TX USA","Santiago, FW (reprint author), Inst Human Infect & Immun, Galveston, TX USA.",pvaguila@utmb.edu,"Vilcarromero, Stalin/H-9263-2019","Vilcarromero, Stalin/0000-0002-9097-0638; Siles, Crystyan/0000-0003-3161-1309","United States Department of Defense Global Emerging Infections Surveillance and Response System, a Division of the Armed Forces Health Surveillance Center [847705.82000.25GB.B0016]; NIH [5R21AI101794-02, HHSN272201000040I/HHSN27200004/D04]; Institute for Human Infection and Immunity at the University of Texas Medical Branch; Department of Pathology; T32 Training grant in Emerging and Re-emerging Infectious Diseases [AI007536]","This research was supported by the United States Department of Defense Global Emerging Infections Surveillance and Response System, a Division of the Armed Forces Health Surveillance Center Work Unit Number: 847705.82000.25GB.B0016, the NIH 5R21AI101794-02 (PVA), Institute for Human Infection and Immunity at the University of Texas Medical Branch, and start-up funds from the Department of Pathology.

The twin goals of the World Health Organization's Global Program to Eliminate Lymphatic Filariasis include interrupting transmission of the parasitic worms that cause LF and providing care to persons who suffer from its clinical manifestations, including lymphedema-so-called morbidity management and disability prevention (MMDP). Scaling up of MMDP has been slow, in part because of a lack of consensus about the effectiveness of recommended hygiene-based interventions for clinical lymphedema. Methods and Findings We conducted a systemic review and meta-analyses to estimate the effectiveness of hygiene-based interventions on LF-related lymphedema. We systematically searched PubMed, Embase, ISI Web of Knowledge, MedCarib, Lilacs, REPIDISCA, DESASTRES, and African Index Medicus databases through March 23, 2015 with no restriction on year of publication. Studies were eligible for inclusion if they (1) were conducted in an area endemic for LF, (2) involved hygiene-based interventions to manage lymphedema, and (3) assessed lymphedema-related morbidity. For clinical outcomes for which three or more studies assessed comparable interventions for lymphedema, we conducted random-effects meta-analyses. Twenty-two studies met the inclusion criteria and two meta-analyses were possible. To evaluate study quality, we developed a set of criteria derived from the GRADE methodology. Publication bias was assessed using funnel plots. Participation in hygiene-based lymphedema management was associated with a lower incidence of acute dermatolymphagioadenitis (ADLA), (Odds Ratio 0.32, 95% CI 0.25-0.40), as well as with a decreased percentage of patients reporting at least one episode of ADLA during follow-up (OR 0.29, 95% CI 0.12-0.47). Limitations included high heterogeneity across studies and variation in components of lymphedema management. Conclusions Available evidence strongly supports the effectiveness of hygiene-based lymphedema management in LF-endemic areas. Despite the aforementioned limitations, these findings highlight the potential to significantly reduce LF-associated morbidity and disability as well as the need to develop standardized approaches to MMDP in LF-endemic areas.","[Stocks, Meredith E.; Addiss, David G.] Task Force Global Hlth, Children Worms, Decatur, GA 30030 USA; [Stocks, Meredith E.; Freeman, Matthew C.] Emory Univ, Dept Environm Hlth, Rollins Sch Publ Hlth, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA","Stocks, ME (reprint author), Task Force Global Hlth, Children Worms, Decatur, GA 30030 USA.",daddiss@taskforce.org,,,,,,60,12,12,0,5,PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE,SAN FRANCISCO,"1160 BATTERY STREET, STE 100, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94111 USA",1935-2735,,,PLOS NEGLECT TROP D,Plos Neglect.

In this study, we report the collection and analysis of samples collected from these regions. We find that cases originate from two different sources. Strains collected from Gansu and Ningxia are closely related to the primary lineage associated with the current epizootic, whereas those from Tibet and Qinghai are related to the Arctic-like-2 lineage that is most commonly associated with wildlife cases in China. Thus, it appears that while the epizootic is beginning to encroach into Gansu and Ningxia, Tibet and Qinghai a significant number of rabies cases originate from wildlife.","[Tao, Xiao-Yan; Guo, Zhen-Yang; Li, Hao; Jiao, Wen-Tao; Shen, Xin-Xin; Zhu, Wu-Yang; Tang, Qing] Chinese Ctr Dis Control & Prevent, Natl Inst Viral Dis Control & Prevent, State Key Lab Infect Dis Prevent & Control, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Tao, Xiao-Yan; Li, Hao; Shen, Xin-Xin; Zhu, Wu-Yang; Tang, Qing] Collaborat Innovat Ctr Diag & Treatment Infect Di, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Rayner, Simon] Univ Oslo, Dept Med Genet, Oslo, Norway; [Rayner, Simon] Chinese Acad Sci, Key Lab Agr & Environm Microbiol, Wuhan Inst Virol, Wuhan, Hubei, Peoples R China","Tao, XY (reprint author), Chinese Ctr Dis Control & Prevent, Natl Inst Viral Dis Control & Prevent, State Key Lab Infect Dis Prevent & Control, Beijing, Peoples R China.",s.raynere@wh.iov.cn; qtang04@sina.com,,,National Department Public Benefit Research Foundation [201103032]; National Basic Research Program of China [2012CB721100]; Development Grant of State Key Laboratory for Infectious Disease Prevention and Control [2014SKLID103],"This study was supported by National Department Public Benefit Research Foundation (201103032), the National Basic Research Program of China (2012CB721100) and the Development Grant of State Key Laboratory for Infectious Disease Prevention and Control (2014SKLID103).

We tested the hypothesis that the nature of the immune response is related to the location of parasite and clinical manifestations of infection. Methodology Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were obtained from untreated patients with neurocysticercosis (NCC), categorized as having parenchymal or subarachnoid infection by the presence of cysts exclusively within the parenchyma or in subarachnoid spaces of the brain, and from uninfected (control) individuals matched by age and gender to each patient. Using multiplex detection technology, sera from NCC patients and controls and cytokine production by PBMC after T. solium antigen (TsAg) stimulation were assayed for levels of inflammatory and regulatory cytokines. PBMC were phenotyped by flow cytometry ex vivo and following in vitro stimulation with TsAg. Principal Findings Sera from patients with parenchymal NCC demonstrated significantly higher Th1 (IFN-gamma/IL-12) and Th2 (IL-4/IL-13) cytokine responses and trends towards higher levels of IL-1 beta/IL-8/IL-5 than those obtained from patients with subarachnoid NCC. Also higher in vitro antigen-driven TNF-beta secretion was detected in PBMC supernatants from parenchymal than in subarachnoid NCC. In contrast, there was a significantly higher IL-10 response to TsAg stimulation in patients with subarachnoid NCC compared to parenchymal NCC. Although no differences in regulatory T cells (Tregs) frequencies were found ex vivo, there was a trend towards greater expansion of Tregs upon TsAg stimulation in subarachnoid than in parenchymal NCC when data were normalized for the corresponding controls. Conclusions/Significance T. solium infection of the subarachnoid space is associated with an enhanced regulatory immune response compared to infection in the parenchyma. The resulting anti-inflammatory milieu may represent a parasite strategy to maintain a permissive environment in the host or diminish inflammatory damage from the host immune response in the central nervous system.","[Tuero, Iskra; Palma, Sandra; Mayta, Holger; Garcia, Hector H.; Gilman, Robert H.] Univ Peruana Cayetano Heredia, Lab Invest Desarrollo, Fac Ciencias & Filosofia, Lima, Peru; [Cabeza, Franco; Gilman, Robert H.] Asociac Benef PRISMA, Lima, Peru; [Saleemi, Sarah; Gilman, Robert H.] Johns Hopkins Univ, Dept Int Hlth, Bloomberg Sch Publ Hlth, Baltimore, MD USA; [Saleemi, Sarah] Johns Hopkins Sch Med, Baltimore, MD USA; [Rodriguez, Silvia; Gonzales, Isidro; Garcia, Hector H.] Inst Nacl Ciencias Neurol, Unidad Cisticercosis, Lima, Peru; [Mahanty, Siddhartha] NIAID, Parasit Dis Lab, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA","Tuero, I (reprint author), NCI, Vaccine Branch, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA.",smahanty@niaid.nih.gov,,"moyano, luz maria/0000-0002-5878-5782; Mahanty, Siddhartha/0000-0003-1068-0524; Mayta, Holger/0000-0001-5306-628X; Palma Albornoz, Sandra Patricia/0000-0001-9638-8529; Tuero, Iskra/0000-0002-5788-1051","Fundacion Instituto Hipolito Unanue, Lima, Peru; FI-NIH Training grant [D43 TW001140]; Welcome Trust Senior International Research Fellowship in Public Health and Tropical Medicine; National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, NIH","This work was supported by Fundacion Instituto Hipolito Unanue, Lima, Peru.

Two sorts of electrocuting device have been particularly useful for studying the behaviour of tsetse flies (Glossina spp), the vectors of the trypanosomes that cause sleeping sickness in humans and nagana in livestock. Such devices consist of grids on netting (E-net) to catch tsetse in flight, or on cloth (E-cloth) to catch alighting flies. Catches are most meaningful when the devices catch as many as possible of the flies potentially available to them, and when the proportion caught is known. There have been conflicting indications for the catching efficiency, depending on whether the assessments were made by the naked eye or assisted by video recordings. Methodology/Principal Findings Using grids of 0.5m(2) in Zimbabwe, we developed catch methods of studying the efficiency of E-nets and E-cloth for tsetse, using improved transformers to supply the grids with electrical pulses of similar to 40kV. At energies per pulse of 35-215mJ, the efficiency was enhanced by reducing the pulse interval from 3200 to 1ms. Efficiency was low at 35mJ per pulse, but there seemed no benefit of increasing the energy beyond 70mJ. Catches at E-nets declined when the fine netting normally used became either coarser or much finer, and increased when the grid frame was moved from 2.5cm to 27.5cm from the grid. Data for muscoids and tabanids were roughly comparable to those for tsetse. Conclusion/Significance The catch method of studying efficiency is useful for supplementing and extending video methods. Specifications are suggested for E-nets and E-cloth that are similar to 95% efficient and suitable for estimating the absolute numbers of available flies. Grids that are less efficient, but more economical, are recommended for studies of relative numbers available to various baits.","[Vale, Glyn A.; Hargrove, John W.] Univ Stellenbosch, South African Ctr Epidemiol Modelling & Anal, ZA-7600 Stellenbosch, South Africa; [Vale, Glyn A.] Univ Greenwich, Nat Resources Inst, Chatham, Kent, England; [Cullis, N.

We performed a systematic review of studies on S. suis meningitis to define the clinical characteristics, predisposing factors and outcome. Methodology Studies published between January 1, 1980 and August 1, 2015 were identified from main literature databases and reference lists. Studies were included if they were written in West-European languages and described at least 5 adult patients with S. suis meningitis in whom at least one clinical characteristic was described. Findings We identified 913 patients with S. suis meningitis included in 24 studies between 1980 and 2015. The mean age was 49 years and 581 of 711 patients were male (82%). Exposure to pigs or pork was present in 395 of 648 patients (61%) while other predisposing factors were less common. 514 of 528 patients presented with fever (97%), 429 of 451 with headache (95%), 462 of 496 with neck stiffness (93%) and 78 of 384 patients (20%) had a skin injury in the presence of pig/pork contact. The case fatality rate was 2.9% and hearing loss was a common sequel occurring in 259 of 489 patients (53%). Treatment included dexamethasone in 157 of 300 (52%) of patients and was associated with reduced hearing loss in S. suis meningitis patients included in a randomized controlled trial. Conclusion S. suis meningitis has a clear association with pig and pork contact. Mortality is low, but hearing loss occurs frequently. Dexamethasone was shown to reduce hearing loss.","[van Samkar, Anusha; Brouwer, Matthijs C.; van de Beek, Diederik] Univ Amsterdam, Acad Med Ctr, Dept Neurol, Ctr Infect & Immun Amsterdam CINIMA, NL-1105 AZ Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Schultsz, Constance] Univ Amsterdam, Acad Med Ctr, Dept Global Hlth, Amsterdam Inst Global Hlth & Dev, NL-1105 AZ Amsterdam, Netherlands; [van der Ende, Arie] Univ Amsterdam, Acad Med Ctr, Dept Med Microbiol, Ctr Infect & Immun Amsterdam CINIMA, NL-1105 AZ Amsterdam, Netherlands; [van der Ende, Arie] Univ Amsterdam, Acad Med Ctr, Netherlands Reference Lab Bacterial Meningitis, NL-1105 AZ Amsterdam, Netherlands","van Samkar, A (reprint author), Univ Amsterdam, Acad Med Ctr, Dept Neurol, Ctr Infect & Immun Amsterdam CINIMA, NL-1105 AZ Amsterdam, Netherlands.",d.vandebeek@amc.uva.nl,,"van de Beek, Diederik/0000-0002-4571-044X",Netherlands Organization for Health Research and Development (ZonMw; NWO-Veni) [916.13.078]; Netherlands Organization for Health Research and Development (ZonMw; NWO-ASPASIA); Netherlands Organization for Health Research and Development (ZonMw; NWO-Vidi grant) [016.116.358]; European Research Council (ERC Starting Grant) [281156],"MCB is supported by a grant from the Netherlands Organization for Health Research and Development (ZonMw; NWO-Veni grant 2012 [916.13.078]).

Chronic human infection and asymptomatic colonization have been reported. However, renal involvement in those with leptospira chronic exposure remains undetermined. Methods and Findings In 2007, a multistage sampling survey for chronic kidney disease (CKD) was conducted in a southern county of Taiwan, an area with a high prevalence of dialysis. Additionally, an independent cohort of 88 participants from a leptospira-endemic town was followed for two years after a flooding in 2009. Risks of CKD, stages of CKD, associated risk factors as well as kidney injury markers were compared among adults with anti-leptospira antibody as defined by titers of microscopic agglutination test (MAT). Of 3045 survey participants, the individuals with previous leptospira exposure disclosed a lower level of eGFR (98.3 +/- 0.4 vs 100.8 +/- 0.6 ml/min per 1.73 m(2), P<0.001) and a higher percentage of CKD, particularly at stage 3a-5 (14.4% vs 8.5%), than those without leptospira exposure. Multivariable linear regression analyses indicated the association of leptospiral infection and lower eGFR (95% CI -4.15 to -1.93, P < 0.001). In a leptospiral endemic town, subjects with a MAT titer >= 400 showed a decreased eGFR and higher urinary kidney injury molecule-1 creatinine ratio (KIM1/Cr) level as compared with those having lower titers of MAT (P<0.05). Furthermore, two participants with persistently high MAT titers had positive urine leptospira DNA and deteriorating renal function. Conclusions and Significance Our data are the first to show that chronic human exposure of leptospirosis is associated significantly with prevalence and severity of CKD and may lead to deterioration of renal function. This study also shed light on the search of underlying factors in areas experiencing CKD of unknown aetiology (CKDu) such as Mesoamerican Nephropathy.","[Yang, Huang-Yu; Hung, Cheng-Chieh; Guo, Yi-Gen; Chen, Yung-Chang; Ko, Yi-Ching; Huang, Chiung-Tseng; Chou, Li-Fang; Tian, Ya-Chung; Chang, Ming-Yang; Hsu, Hsiang-Hao; Yang, Chih-Wei] Chang Gung Univ, Chang Gung Mem Hosp, Dept Nephrol, Kidney Res Ctr,Coll Med, Taoyuan, Taiwan; [Yang, Huang-Yu] Johns Hopkins Univ, Bloomberg Sch Publ Hlth, Baltimore, MD USA; [Liu, Su-Hsun] Chang Gung Univ, Chang Gung Mem Hosp, Dept Family Med, Coll Med, Taoyuan, Taiwan; [Lin, Ming-Yen; Hwang, Shang-Jyh] Kaohsiung Med Univ Hosp, Div Nephrol, Dept Internal Med, Kaohsiung, Taiwan","Yang, HY (reprint author), Chang Gung Univ, Chang Gung Mem Hosp, Dept Nephrol, Kidney Res Ctr,Coll Med, Taoyuan, Taiwan.",sjhwang@kmu.edu.tw; cwyang@ms1.hinet.net,,"Chang, Ming-Yang/0000-0001-8899-0376; Lin, Ming-Yen/0000-0002-8194-4833","Chang Gung Memorial Hospital [CRRPG3D0011]; Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan, R.O.C.

The mechanisms of action of niclosamide, the active ingredient in the most widely used molluscicides, remain largely unknown. A better understanding of its toxicology at the molecular level will both improve our knowledge of snail biology and may offer valuable insights into the development of better chemical control methods for snails. We used a recently developed Biomphalaria glabrata oligonucleotide microarray (31K features) to investigate the effect of sublethal exposure to niclosamide on the transcriptional responses of the snail B. glabrata relative to untreated snails. Most of the genes highly upregulated following exposure of snails to niclosamide are involved in biotransformation of xenobiotics, including genes encoding cytochrome P450s (CYP), glutathione S-transferases (GST), and drug transporters, notably multi-drug resistance protein (efflux transporter) and solute linked carrier (influx transporter). Niclosamide also induced stress responses. Specifically, six heat shock protein (HSP) genes from three super-families (HSP20, HSP40 and HSP70) were upregulated. Genes encoding ADP-ribosylation factor (ARF), cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) and coatomer, all of which are involved in vesicle trafficking in the Golgi of mammalian cells, were also upregulated. Lastly, a hemoglobin gene was downregulated, suggesting niclosamide may affect oxygen transport. Our results show that snails mount substantial responses to sublethal concentrations of niclosamide, at least some of which appear to be protective. The topic of how niclosamide's lethality at higher concentrations is determined requires further study. Given that niclosamide has also been used as an anthelmintic drug for decades and has been found to have activity against several types of cancer, our findings may be of relevance in understanding how both parasites and neoplastic cells respond to this compound.","[Zhang, Si-Ming; Buddenborg, Sarah K.; Adema, Coen M.; Loker, Eric S.] Univ New Mexico, Dept Biol, Ctr Evolutionary & Theoret Immunol, Albuquerque, NM 87131 USA; [Sullivan, John T.] Univ San Francisco, Dept Biol, San Francisco, CA 94117 USA; [Loker, Eric S.] Univ New Mexico, Dept Biol, Museum Southwestern Biol, Parasite Div, Albuquerque, NM 87131 USA","Zhang, SM (reprint author), Univ New Mexico, Dept Biol, Ctr Evolutionary & Theoret Immunol, Albuquerque, NM 87131 USA.",zhangsm@unm.edu,,,"National Institute of Health [AI101438, 1R15A1097967]","The study was supported by National Institute of Health (www.nih.gov) grant AI101438 (ESL) and 1R15A1097967 (JTS).

In Mexico, N. brasiliensis is the predominant etiologic agent. Therapeutic alternatives are necessary because the current drug regimens have several disadvantages. Benzothiazinones (BTZ) are a new class of candidate drugs that inhibit decaprenylphosphoribose- epimerase (DprE1), an essential enzyme involved in the cell wall biosynthesis of Corynebacterineae. Methodology/Principal findings In this study, the in vitro activity of the next generation BTZ, PBTZ169, was tested against thirty Nocardia brasiliensis isolates. The MIC50 and MIC90 values for PBTZ169 were 0.0075 and 0.03 mu g/mL, respectively. Because Nocardia is a potential intracellular bacterium, a THP-1 macrophage monolayer was infected with N. brasiliensis HUJEG-1 and then treated with PBTZ169, resulting in a decrease in the number of colony-forming units (CFUs) at a concentration of 0.25X the in vitro value. The in vivo activity was evaluated after infecting female BALB/c mice in the right hind food-pad. After 6 weeks, treatment was initiated with PBTZ169 and its activity was compared with the first generation compound, BTZ043. Both BTZ compounds were administered at 100 mg/kg twice daily by gavage, and sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim (SXT), at 100 mg/kg sulfamethoxazole, was used as a positive control. After 22 weeks of therapy, only PBTZ169 and SXT displayed statistically significant activity. Conclusion These results indicate that DprE1 inhibitors may be useful for treating infections of Nocardia and may therefore be active against other actinomycetoma agents. We must test combinations of these compounds with other antimicrobial agents, such as linezolid, tedizolid or SXT, that have good to excellent in vivo activity, as well as new DprE1 inhibitors that can achieve higher plasma levels.","[Alejandra Gonzalez-Martinez, Norma; De Osio-Cortez, Alexandra; Ocampo-Candiani, Jorge; Vera-Cabrera, Lucio] Hosp Univ Dr Jose Eleuterio Gonzalez, Serv Dermatol, Lab Interdisciplinario Invest Dermatol, Monterrey, Nuevo Leon, Mexico; [Gerardo Lozano-Garza, Hector; Castro-Garza, Jorge; Vargas-Villarreal, Javier] IMSS, Ctr Invest Biomed Noreste, Monterrey, Nuevo Leon, Mexico; [Cavazos-Rocha, Norma] UANL, Dept Quim Analit, Fac Med, Monterrey, Nuevo Leon, Mexico; [Makarov, Vadim] Russian Acad Sci, AN Bakh Biochem Inst, Moscow, Russia; [Cole, Stewart T.] Ecole Polytech Fed Lausanne, Global Hlth Inst, Lausanne, Switzerland","Gonzalez-Martinez, NA (reprint author), Hosp Univ Dr Jose Eleuterio Gonzalez, Serv Dermatol, Lab Interdisciplinario Invest Dermatol, Monterrey, Nuevo Leon, Mexico.",luvera_99@yahoo.com,"Castro-Garza, Jorge/N-7669-2017","Castro-Garza, Jorge/0000-0003-3828-5454",,,,16,3,3,0,5,PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE,SAN FRANCISCO,"1160 BATTERY STREET, STE 100, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94111 USA",1935-2735,,,PLOS NEGLECT TROP D,Plos Neglect.

Among different factors, the specific recognition of glycan structures by glycan-binding proteins from the parasite or from the mammalian host cells may play a critical role in the evolution of the infection. Methodology and Principal Findings Here we investigated the contribution of galectin-1 (Gal-1), an endogenous glycan-binding protein abundantly expressed in human and mouse heart, to the pathophysiology of T. cruzi infection, particularly in the context of cardiac pathology. We found that exposure of HL-1 cardiac cells to Gal-1 reduced the percentage of infection by two different T. cruzi strains, Tulahuen (TcVI) and Brazil (TcI). In addition, Gal-1 prevented exposure of phosphatidylserine and early events in the apoptotic program by parasite infection on HL-1 cells. These effects were not mediated by direct interaction with the parasite surface, suggesting that Gal-1 may act through binding to host cells. Moreover, we also observed that T. cruzi infection altered the glycophenotype of cardiac cells, reducing binding of exogenous Gal-1 to the cell surface. Consistent with these data, Gal-1 deficient (Lgals1(-/-)) mice showed increased parasitemia, reduced signs of inflammation in heart and skeletal muscle tissues, and lower survival rates as compared to wild-type (WT) mice in response to intraperitoneal infection with T. cruzi Tulahuen strain. Conclusion/Significance Our results indicate that Gal-1 modulates T. cruzi infection of cardiac cells, highlighting the relevance of galectins and their ligands as regulators of host-parasite interactions.","[Benatar, Alejandro F.; Tasso, Laura M.; Gomez, Karina A.] Inst Invest Ingn Genet & Biol Mol INGEBI CONICET, Lab Biol Mol Enfermedad Chagas LabMECh, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [Garcia, Gabriela A.; Bua, Jacqeline; Postan, Miriam] Adm Nacl Lab & Inst Salud Dr Carlos G Malbran, Inst Nacl Parasitol Dr Mario Fatala Chaben, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [Cerliani, Juan P.; Stupirski, Juan C.; Toscano, Marta A.; Rabinovich, Gabriel A.] Inst Biol & Med Expt IBYME CONICET, Lab Inmunopatol, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [Scaglione, Jorge] Hosp Pedro Elizalde, Serv Cardiol, Secc Electrofisiol, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [Rabinovich, Gabriel A.] Univ Buenos Aires, Fac Ciencias Exactas & Nat, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina","Benatar, AF (reprint author), Inst Invest Ingn Genet & Biol Mol INGEBI CONICET, Lab Biol Mol Enfermedad Chagas LabMECh, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina.",drkagomez@gmail.com,,,Agencia Nacional de Promocion Cientifica y Tecnologica (ANPCyT); Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas (CONICET); Fundacion Florencio Fiorini,"This work was supported by grants from Agencia Nacional de Promocion Cientifica y Tecnologica (ANPCyT), Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas (CONICET) to GAR and KAG and Fundacion Florencio Fiorini to KAG.

Targeting Wolbachia for elimination is a therapeutic approach that shows promise in the treatment of onchocerciasis and lymphatic filariasis. Here we demonstrate the use of a biodegradable polyanhydride nanoparticle-based platform for the co-delivery of the antibiotic doxycycline with the antiparasitic drug, ivermectin, to reduce microfilarial burden and rapidly kill adult worms. When doxycycline and ivermectin were co-delivered within polyanhydride nanoparticles, effective killing of adult female Brugia malayi filarial worms was achieved with approximately 4,000-fold reduction in the amount of drug used. Additionally the time to death of the macrofilaria was also significantly reduced (five-fold) when the anti-filarial drug cocktail was delivered within polyanhydride nanoparticles. We hypothesize that the mechanism behind this dramatically enhanced killing of the macrofilaria is the ability of the polyanhydride nanoparticles to behave as a Trojan horse and penetrate the cuticle, bypassing excretory pumps of B. malayi, and effectively deliver drug directly to both the worm and Wolbachia at high enough microenvironmental concentrations to cause death. These provocative findings may have significant consequences for the reduction in the amount of drug and the length of treatment required for filarial infections in terms of patient compliance and reduced cost of treatment.","[Binnebose, Andrea M.; Bellaire, Bryan H.] Iowa State Univ, Dept Vet Microbiol & Prevent Med, Ames, IA 50011 USA; [Haughney, Shannon L.; Narasimhan, Balaji] Iowa State Univ, Dept Chem & Biol Engn, Ames, IA USA; [Martin, Richard] Iowa State Univ, Dept Biomed Sci, Ames, IA USA; [Imerman, Paula M.] Iowa State Univ, Vet Diagnost Lab, Ames, IA USA","Binnebose, AM (reprint author), Iowa State Univ, Dept Vet Microbiol & Prevent Med, Ames, IA 50011 USA.",nbalaji@iastate.edu; bbella@iastate.edu,"Martin, Richard/A-1783-2011; Narasimhan, Balaji/A-5487-2008","Martin, Richard/0000-0003-2422-1847; Narasimhan, Balaji/0000-0002-7955-5353",Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation Grand Challenges Exploration Opportunity [1087610]; NIH-NIAID [R01 AI047195],"The authors gratefully acknowledge financial support from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation (www.gatesfoundation.org) Grand Challenges Exploration Opportunity (1087610) and from NIH-NIAID R01 AI047195.

Their relatively high prevalence in people has been described in Uganda recently. While non-human primates also harbor Oesophagostomum spp., the epidemiology of this oesophagostomosis and the role of these animals as reservoirs of the infection in Eastern Africa are not yet well documented. Methodology/Principal Findings The present study aimed to investigate Oesophagostomum infection in terms of parasite species diversity, prevalence and load in three non-human primates (Pan troglodytes, Papio anubis, Colobus guereza) and humans living in close proximity in a forested area of Sebitoli, Kibale National Park (KNP), Uganda. The molecular phylogenetic analyses provided the first evidence that humans living in the Sebitoli area harbored O. stephanostomum, a common species in free-ranging chimpanzees. Chimpanzees were also infected by O. bifurcum, a common species described in human populations throughout Africa. The recently described Oesophagostomum sp. found in colobine monkeys and humans and which was absent from baboons in the neighboring site of Kanyawara in KNP (10 km from Sebitoli), was only found in baboons. Microscopic analyses revealed that the infection prevalence and parasite load in chimpanzees were significantly lower in Kanyawara than in Sebitoli, an area more impacted by human activities at its borders. Conclusions/Significance Three different Oesophagostomum species circulate in humans and non-human primates in the Sebitoli area and our results confirm the presence of a new genotype of Oesophagostomum recently described in Uganda. The high spatiotemporal overlap between humans and chimpanzees in the studied area coupled with the high infection prevalence among chimpanzees represent factors that could increase the risk of transmission for O. stephanostomum between the two primate species. Finally, the importance of local-scale research for zoonosis risk management is important because environmental disturbance and species contact can differ, leading to different parasitological profiles between sites that are close together within the same forest patches.","[Cibot, Marie; Lafosse, Sophie; Bon, Celine; Krief, Sabrina] Museum Natl Hist Nat, Ecoanthropol & Ethnobiol, UMR 7206, F-75231 Paris, France; [Cibot, Marie] Museum Natl Hist Nat, Mecanismes Adaptatifs Organismes Communautes, UMR 7179, F-75231 Paris, France; [Cibot, Marie; Krief, Sabrina] Sebitoli Res Stn, Great Apes Conservat Project, Ft Portal, Uganda; [Guillot, Jacques] UPE, Ecole Natl Vet Alfort, Dynamyc Res Grp EnvA UPEC, Dept Parasitol, Maisons Alfort, France; [Seguya, Andrew] Uganda Wildlife Author, Kampala, Uganda","Cibot, M (reprint author), Museum Natl Hist Nat, Ecoanthropol & Ethnobiol, UMR 7206, F-75231 Paris, France.",marie.cibotchemin@gmail.com,"Guillot, Jacques/J-9428-2016","Guillot, Jacques/0000-0003-3577-6979",LabEx BCDIV; Projet pour la Conservation des Grands Singes; National Museum of Natural History / ATM 16; ANR JC-JC SAFAPE,"MC received funds from LabEx BCDIV, National Museum of Natural History / ATM 16, ANR JC-JC SAFAPE to design and conduct the study.

These complementary methods revealed critical steps necessary for the parasite population to colonize the insect gut and establish vector infection. Methodology/Principal Findings qPCR analysis of the parasite load in the insect gut showed several limitations due mainly to the presence of digestive-derived products that are thought to degrade DNA and inhibit further the PCR reaction. We developed a real-time PCR strategy targeting the T. cruzi repetitive satellite DNA sequence using as internal standard for normalization, an exogenous heterologous DNA spiked into insect samples extract, to precisely quantify the parasite load in each segment of the insect gut (anterior midgut, AM, posterior midgut, PM, and hindgut, H). Using combined fluorescence microscopy and BLI imaging as well as qPCR analysis, we showed that during their journey through the insect digestive tract, most of the parasites are lysed in the AM during the first 24 hours independently of the gut microbiota. During this short period, live parasites move through the PM to establish the onset of infection. At days 3-4 post-infection (p.i.), the parasite population begins to colonize the H to reach a climax at day 7 p.i., which is maintained during the next two weeks. Remarkably, the fluctuation of the parasite number in H remains relatively stable over the two weeks after refeeding, while the populations residing in the AM and PM increases slightly and probably constitutes the reservoirs of dividing epimastigotes. Conclusions/Significance These data show that a tuned dynamic control of the population operates in the insect gut to maintain an equilibrium between non-dividing infective trypomastigote forms and dividing epimastigote forms of the parasite, which is crucial for vector competence.","[Dias, Felipe de Almeida; Vieira, Larissa Rezende; Perdomo, Hugo Diego; Paiva Gandara, Ana Caroline; Vionette do Amaral, Raquel Juliana; Ferreira Sorgine, Marcos Henrique; de Oliveira, Pedro Lagerblad; Salmon, Didier] Univ Fed Rio de Janeiro, Inst Bioquim Med Leopoldo de Meis, Rio De Janeiro, Brazil; [Guerra, Barbara; Medei, Emiliano] Univ Fed Rio de Janeiro, Ctr Nacl Biol Estrutural & Bioimagem CENABIO, Rio De Janeiro, Brazil; [Vollu, Renata Estebanez] Univ Fed Rio de Janeiro, Inst Microbiol Prof Paulo de Goes, Rio De Janeiro, Brazil; [Oliveira Gomes, Suzete Araujo] Univ Fed Fluminense, Dept Biol Geral, Rio De Janeiro, Brazil; [Lara, Flavio Alves] Fundacao Oswaldo Cruz, Inst Oswaldo Cruz, Rio De Janeiro, Brazil; [Ferreira Sorgine, Marcos Henrique; de Oliveira, Pedro Lagerblad] Inst Nacl Ciencia & Tecnol Entomol Mol INCT EM, Rio De Janeiro, Brazil","Dias, FD (reprint author), Univ Fed Rio de Janeiro, Inst Bioquim Med Leopoldo de Meis, Rio De Janeiro, Brazil.",salmon@bioqmed.ufrj.br,"Lara, Flavio Alves/L-1861-2013; Perdomo, Hugo D./S-2723-2019; Perdomo, Hugo/J-6091-2014; Vionette do Amaral, Raquel Juliana/E-1192-2018; Oliveira, Pedro/A-9438-2010","Perdomo, Hugo D./0000-0002-8783-1557; Perdomo, Hugo/0000-0002-8783-1557; Paiva Gandara, Ana Caroline/0000-0003-3194-4453; Medei, Emiliano/0000-0002-0044-1311; Oliveira, Pedro/0000-0003-0307-354X","Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPq); Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES); Wallonie-Bruxelles International (WBI)/Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES); Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado do Rio de Janeiro (FAPERJ); Instituto Nacional de Ciencia e Tecnologia em Entomologia Molecular (INCTEM), Rio de Janeiro, Brazil; Instituto Nacional de Ciencia e Tecnologia de Biologia Estrutural e Bioimagem (INBEB), Rio de Janeiro, Brazil","This work was supported by grants from the Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPq) (www.cnpq.br), Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES) (www.capes.gov.br), the Wallonie-Bruxelles International (WBI) (www.wbi.be)/Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES) bilateral cooperation agreement, Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado do Rio de Janeiro (FAPERJ) (www.faperj.br), Instituto Nacional de Ciencia e Tecnologia em Entomologia Molecular (INCTEM) (www.inctem.bioqmed.ufrj.br), Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, and Instituto Nacional de Ciencia e Tecnologia de Biologia Estrutural e Bioimagem (INBEB) (www.imbebb.org.br), Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.

As of January 2015, local and imported CHIKV has been reported in 50 American countries with over 1.1 million suspected cases. CHIKV causes a severe arthralgic disease for which there are no approved vaccines or therapeutics. Furthermore, the lack of a commercially available, sensitive, and affordable diagnostic assay limits surveillance and control efforts. To address this issue, we utilized an insect-specific alphavirus, Eilat virus (EILV), to develop a diagnostic antigen that does not require biosafety containment facilities to produce. We demonstrated that EILV/CHIKV replicates to high titers in insect cells and can be applied directly in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays without inactivation, resulting in highly sensitive detection of recent and past CHIKV infection, and outperforming traditional antigen preparations.","[Erasmus, Jesse H.; Weaver, Scott C.] Univ Texas Med Branch, Inst Translat Sci, Galveston, TX 77555 USA; [Erasmus, Jesse H.; Nasar, Farooq; Weaver, Scott C.] Univ Texas Med Branch, Ctr Trop Dis, Galveston, TX 77555 USA; [Needham, James; Raychaudhuri, Syamal; Morkowski, Stan] InBios Int Inc, Seattle, WA USA; [Diamond, Michael S.] Washington Univ, Sch Med, Dept Med, St Louis, MO 63110 USA; [Diamond, Michael S.] Washington Univ, Sch Med, Dept Mol Microbiol, St Louis, MO 63110 USA; [Diamond, Michael S.] Washington Univ, Sch Med, Dept Pathol & Immunol, St Louis, MO 63110 USA; [Beasley, David W.

Risk factors include diabetes, alcoholism and renal disease, and a vaccine targeting at-risk populations is urgently required. A better understanding of the protective immune response in naturally infected patients is essential for vaccine design. Methods We conducted a longitudinal clinical and immunological study of 200 patients with melioidosis on admission, 12 weeks (n = 113) and 52 weeks (n = 65) later. Responses to whole killed B. pseudomallei were measured in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) by interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) ELIspot assay and flow cytometry and compared to those of control subjects in the region with diabetes (n = 45) and without diabetes (n = 43). Results We demonstrated strong CD4+ and CD8+ responses to B. pseudomallei during acute disease, 12 weeks and 52 weeks later. 28-day mortality was 26% for melioidosis patients, and B. pseudomallei-specific cellular responses in fatal cases (mean 98 IFN-gamma cells per million PBMC) were significantly lower than those in the survivors (mean 142 IFN-gamma cells per million PBMC) in a multivariable logistic regression model (P = 0.01). A J-shaped curve association between circulating neutrophil count and mortality was seen with an optimal count of 4000 to 8000 neutrophils/mu l. Melioidosis patients with known diabetes had poor diabetic control (median glycated haemoglobin HbA(1c) 10.2%, interquartile range 9.2-13.1) and showed a stunted B. pseudomallei-specific cellular response during acute illness compared to those without diabetes. Conclusions The results demonstrate the role of both CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells in protection against melioidosis, and an interaction between diabetes and cellular responses. This supports development of vaccine strategies that induce strong T-cell responses for the control of intracellular pathogens such as B. pseudomallei.","[Jenjaroen, Kemajittra; Chumseng, Suchintana; Sumonwiriya, Manutsanun; Ariyaprasert, Pitchayanant; Chantratita, Narisara; Sunyakumthorn, Piyanate; Hongsuwan, Maliwan; Wuthiekanun, Vanaporn; Limmathurotsakul, Direk; Day, Nicholas P.

One such intervention may include population based deworming, recommended as of 12 months of age by the World Health Organization in soil-transmitted helminth (STH)-endemic areas; however, the benefit of deworming has been understudied in early preschool-age children. Methodology/Principal Findings A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was conducted to determine the effect of deworming (500mg single-dose crushed mebendazole tablet) on growth in one-year-old children in Iquitos, Peru. Children were enrolled during their routine 12-month growth and development clinic visit and followed up at their 18 and 24-month visits. Children were randomly allocated to: Group 1: deworming at 12 months and placebo at 18 months; Group 2: placebo at 12 months and deworming at 18 months; Group 3: deworming at both 12 and 18 months; or Group 4: placebo at both 12 and 18 months (i.e. control group). The primary outcome was weight gain at the 24-month visit. An intention-to-treat approach was used. A total of 1760 children were enrolled between September 2011 and June 2012. Follow-up of 1563 children (88.8%) was completed by July 2013. STH infection was of low prevalence and predominantly light intensity in the study population. All groups gained between 1.93 and 2.05 kg on average over 12 months; the average difference in weight gain (kg) compared to placebo was: 0.05 (95% CI: -0.05, 0.17) in Group 1; -0.07 (95% CI: -0.17, 0.04) in Group 2; and 0.04 (95% CI: -0.06, 0.14) in Group 3. There was no statistically significant difference in weight gain in any of the deworming intervention groups compared to the control group. Conclusions Overall, with one year of follow-up, no effect of deworming on growth could be detected in this population of preschool-age children. Low baseline STH prevalence and intensity and/ or access to deworming drugs outside of the trial may have diluted the potential effect of the intervention. Additional research is required to overcome these challenges and to contribute to strengthening the evidence base on deworming.","[Joseph, Serene A.; Blouin, Brittany; Gyorkos, Theresa W.] McGill Univ, Dept Epidemiol Biostat & Occupat Hlth, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Joseph, Serene A.; Rahme, Elham; Blouin, Brittany; Gyorkos, Theresa W.] McGill Univ, Res Inst, Ctr Hlth, Div Clin Epidemiol, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Casapia, Martin; Pezo, Lidsky] Asociac Civil Selva Amazon, Iquitos, Peru; [Montresor, Antonio] WHO, Dept Control Neglected Trop Dis, CH-1211 Geneva, Switzerland; [Rahme, Elham; Gyorkos, Theresa W.] McGill Univ, Dept Med, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Ward, Brian J.; Gyorkos, Theresa W.] McGill Univ, Dept Med, JD MacLean Ctr Trop Dis, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Ward, Brian J.] McGill Univ, Ctr Hlth, Res Inst, Natl Reference Ctr Parasitol, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Marquis, Grace S.] McGill Univ, Sch Dietet & Human Nutr, Ste Anne De Bellevue, PQ, Canada; [Maheu-Giroux, Mathieu] Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, St Marys Hosp, Dept Infect Dis Epidemiol, London, England","Joseph, SA (reprint author), McGill Univ, Dept Epidemiol Biostat & Occupat Hlth, Montreal, PQ, Canada.",theresa.gyorkos@mcgill.ca,"Maheu-Giroux, Mathieu/R-4034-2019; Montresor, Antonio/J-3137-2019","Maheu-Giroux, Mathieu/0000-0002-8363-4388; Blouin, Brittany/0000-0001-7447-7467",Thrasher Research Fund; Canadian Institutes of Health Research [MOP-110969]; Research Institute of the McGill University Health Centre; Fonds de Recherche du Quebec-Sante,"This study was supported by grants from the Thrasher Research Fund (https://www.thrasherresearch.org) and the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (http://www.cihr-irsc.gc.ca/) (MOP-110969) (Principal Investigator: TWG; Co-investigators: SAJ, AM, MC, BJW, GSM, ER).

We hypothesized that different curative immune responses might develop with systemic and local treatment modalities. Methods We studied the peripheral blood immune cells in a cohort of 54 cutaneous Leishmania major subjects treated with SSG or TM. Multiparameter flow cytometry, lymphoproliferative assays and cytokine production were analyzed in order to investigate the differences in the immune responses of subjects before, on and after treatment. Results Healing cutaneous leishmaniasis lead to a significant decline in circulating T cells and NKT-like cells, accompanied by an expansion in NK cells, regardless of treatment modality. Functional changes involved decreased antigen specific CD4(+) T cell proliferation (hyporesponsiveness) seen with CD8(+) T cell depletion. Moreover, the healing (or healed) state was characterized by fewer circulating regulatory T cells, reduced IFN-gamma production and an overall contraction in polyfunctional CD4(+) T cells. Conclusion Healing from cutaneous Leishmaniasis is a dynamic process that alters circulating lymphocyte populations and subsets of T, NK and NKT-like cells. Immunology of healing, through local or systemic treatments, culminated in similar changes in frequency, quality, and antigen specific responsiveness with immunomodulation possibly via a CD8(+) T cell dependent mechanism. Understanding the evolving immunologic changes during healing of human leishmaniasis informs protective immune mechanisms.","[Lakhal-Naouar, Ines; Aronson, Naomi E.] Uniformed Serv Univ Hlth Sci, Dept Med, Bethesda, MD 20814 USA; [Lakhal-Naouar, Ines; Slike, Bonnie M.] Henry M Jackson Fdn Adv Mil Med, Bethesda, MD USA; [Slike, Bonnie M.; Marovich, Mary A.] Walter Reed Army Inst Res, US Mil HIV Res Program, Silver Spring, MD USA; [Aronson, Naomi E.; Marovich, Mary A.] Walter Reed Natl Mil Med Ctr, Bethesda, MD USA","Lakhal-Naouar, I (reprint author), Uniformed Serv Univ Hlth Sci, Dept Med, Room A3060, Bethesda, MD 20814 USA.",naomi.aronson@usuhs.edu,,,"Department of Defense Global War on Terrorism funds; Henry M.

This study aimed to assess the prevalence of these two filarial diseases in febrile and afebrile children using quantitative real-time PCR and standard PCR assays coupled with sequencing. Methodology/Principal Findings DNA from blood specimens of 1,418 Gabonese children (1,258 febrile and 160 afebrile) were analyzed. Overall, filarial DNA was detected in 95 (6.7%) children, including 67 positive for M. perstans (4.7%), which was the most common. M. perstans was detected in 61/1,258 febrile children (4.8%) and 6/160 afebrile children (3.8%, P = 0.6). Its prevalence increased statistically with age: 3.5%, 7.7% and 10.6% in children aged <= 5, 6-10 and 11-15 years, respectively. M. perstans prevalence was significantly higher in Koulamoutou and Lastourville (12% and 10.5%, respectively) than in Franceville and Fougamou (2.6% and 2.4%, respectively). Loa loa was detected in seven febrile children including one co-infection with M. perstans. Finally, 21 filarial DNA positive were negative for M. perstans and Loa loa, but ITS sequencing could be performed for 12 and allowed the identification of a potential new species of Mansonella provisionally called ""DEUX"". Mansonella sp. ""DEUX"" was detected only in febrile children. Conclusions/Significance Further study should be performed to characterize Mansonella sp. ""DEUX"" and evaluate the clinical significance of mansonellosis in humans.","[Mourembou, Gael; Fenollar, Florence; Ehounoud, Cyrille Herve Bile; Bittar, Fadi; Raoult, Didier; Mediannikov, Oleg] Aix Marseille Univ, URMITE, UM63, CNRS 7278,IRD 198,INSERM 1095, Marseille, France; [Mourembou, Gael] Ecole Doctorale Reg Afrique Cent, Franceville, Gabon; [Lekana-Douki, Jean Bernard; Nzondo, Sydney Maghendji] Unite Parasitol Med UPARAM CIRMF, Franceville, Gabon; [Lekana-Douki, Jean Bernard] Univ Sci Sante, Dept Parasitol Mycol & Med Trop, Libreville, Gabon; [Mbiguino, Angelique Ndjoyi] Univ Sci Sante, Dept Microbiol, Lab Natl Reference IST Sida, Fac Med, Libreville, Gabon; [Matsiegui, Pierre Blaise; Manego, Rella Zoleko] Ctr Rech Med Ngounie, Fougamou, Gabon","Mourembou, G (reprint author), Aix Marseille Univ, URMITE, UM63, CNRS 7278,IRD 198,INSERM 1095, Marseille, France.",olegusss1@gmail.com,"Bittar, Fadi/F-2037-2018; Mediannikov, Oleg/H-4018-2015","Bittar, Fadi/0000-0003-4052-344X; Mediannikov, Oleg/0000-0001-6039-2008; raoult, didier/0000-0002-0633-5974",Infectiopole Sud foundation,"This work was funded by Infectiopole Sud foundation (http://www.infectiopolesud.com/).

The study described in this paper hypothesises that it can and assesses the effectiveness of a 'contact intervention'. Methods/Principal Findings This cluster-randomized controlled intervention study is part of the Stigma Assessment and Reduction of Impact (SARI) project conducted in Cirebon District, Indonesia. Testimonies, participatory videos and comics given or made by people affected by leprosy were used as methods to facilitate a dialogue during so-called 'contact events'. A mix of seven quantitative and qualitative methods, including two scales to assess aspects of stigma named the SDS and EMIC-CSS, were used to establish a baseline regarding stigma and knowledge of leprosy, monitor the implementation and assess the impact of the contact events. The study sample were community members selected using different sampling methods. The baseline shows a lack of knowledge about leprosy, a high level of stigma and contrasting examples of support. In total, 91 contact events were organised in 62 villages, directly reaching 4,443 community members (mean 49 per event). The interview data showed that knowledge about leprosy increased and that negative attitudes reduced. The adjusted mean total score of the EMIC-CSS reduced by 4.95 points among respondents who had attended a contact event (n = 58; p < 0.001, effect size = 0.75) compared to the score at baseline (n = 213); for the SDS this was 3.56 (p < 0.001, effect size = 0.81). About 75% of those attending a contact event said they shared the information with others (median 10 persons). Conclusions/Significance The contact intervention was effective in increasing knowledge and improving public attitudes regarding leprosy. It is relatively easy to replicate elsewhere and does not require expensive technology. More research is needed to improve scalability. The effectiveness of a contact intervention to reduce stigma against other neglected tropical diseases and conditions should be evaluated.","[Peters, Ruth M. H.; Zweekhorst, Marjolein B.

This study evaluates the efficacy of miltefosine in the treatment of post kala-azar dermal leishmaniasis (PKDL) patients recruited over a period of 5 years with 18 months of follow-up. Methodology In this study 86 confirmed cases of PKDL were treated with two different dosage regimens of miltefosine (Regimen I-50mg twice daily for 90 days and Regimen II-50 mg thrice for 60 days) and the clinical outcome assessed monthly. Cure/relapse was ascertained by clinical and histopathological examination, and measuring parasite burden by quantitative real-time PCR. In vitro susceptibility of parasites towards miltefosine was estimated at both promastigote and amastigote stages. Results Seventy three of eighty six patients completed the treatment and achieved clinical cure. Approximately 4% (3/73) patients relapsed by the end of 12 months follow-up, while a total of 15% (11/73) relapsed by the end of 18 months. Relapse rate was significantly higher in regimen II (31%) compared to regimen I (10.5%) (P<0.005). Parasite load at the pre-treatment stage was significantly higher (P<0.005) in cases that relapsed compared to the cases that remained cured. In vitro susceptibility towards miltefosine of parasites isolated after relapse was significantly lower (>2 fold) in comparison with the pre-treatment isolates (P<0.005).

Recently, a similar to 30 kDa S. mansoni sulfotransferase (SmSULT) was identified as the target of OXA action. Methodology/Principal Findings Here, we separate the OXA enantiomers using chromatographic methods and assign their optical activities as dextrorotary [(+)-OXA] or levorotary [(-)-OXA]. Crystal structures of the parasite enzyme in complex with optically pure (+)-OXA and (-)-OXA) reveal their absolute configurations as S- and R-, respectively. When tested in vitro, S-OXA demonstrated the bulk of schistosomicidal activity, while R-OXA had antischistosomal effects when present at relatively high concentrations. Crystal structures R-OXA center dot SmSULT and S-OXA center dot SmSULT complexes reveal similarities in the modes of OXA binding, but only the S-OXA enantiomer is observed in the structure of the enzyme exposed to racemic OXA. Conclusions/Significance Together the data suggest the higher schistosomicidal activity of S-OXA is correlated with its ability to outcompete R-OXA binding the sulfotransferase active site. These findings have important implications for the design, syntheses, and dosing of new OXA-based antischistosomal compounds.","[Taylor, Alexander B.; Cao, Xiaohang; Rugel, Anastasia R.; Holloway, Stephen P.; Hart, P.

This study aimed to investigate the prevalence of Cryptosporidium parvum/hominis, Entamoeba histolytica and Giardia lamblia among young children in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, and identify risk factors for infection. Methodology/Principal Findings We performed an unmatched case-control study among children < 2 years of age in Dar es Salaam, recruited from August 2010 to July 2011. Detection and identification of protozoans were done by PCR techniques on DNA from stool specimens from 701 cases of children admitted due to diarrhea at the three study hospitals, and 558 controls of children with no history of diarrhea during the last month prior to enrollment. The prevalence of C. parvum/hominis was 10.4% (84.7% C. hominis), and that of G. lamblia 4.6%. E. histolytica was not detected. The prevalence of Cryptosporidium was significantly higher in cases (16.3%) than in controls (3.1%; P < 0.001; OR = 6.2; 95% CI: 3.7-10.4). G. lamblia was significantly more prevalent in controls (6.1%) than in cases (3.4%; P = 0.027; OR = 1.8; 95% CI: 1.1-3.1). Cryptosporidium infection was found more often in HIV-positive (24.2%) than in HIV-negative children (3.9%; P < 0.001; OR = 7.9; 95% CI: 3.1-20.5), and was also associated with rainfall (P < 0.001; OR = 2.41; 95% CI: 1.5-3.8). Among cases, stunted children had significantly higher risk of being infected with Cryptosporidium (P = 0.011; OR = 2.12; 95% CI: 1.2-3.8). G. lamblia infection was more prevalent in the cool season (P = 0.004; OR = 2.2; 95% CI: 1.3-3.8), and more frequent among cases aged > 12 months (P = 0.003; OR = 3.5; 95% CI: 1.5-7.8). Among children aged 7-12 months, those who were breastfed had lower prevalence of G. lamblia infection than those who had been weaned (P = 0.012). Conclusions Cryptosporidium infection is common among young Tanzanian children with diarrhea, particularly those living with HIV, and infection is more frequent during the rainy season. G. lamblia is frequently implicated in asymptomatic infections, but rarely causes overt diarrheal illness, and its prevalence increases with age.","[Tellevik, Marit G.; Blomberg, Bjorn; Hanevik, Kurt] Haukeland Hosp, Natl Ctr Trop Infect Dis, Dept Med, N-5021 Bergen, Norway; [Moyo, Sabrina J.; Blomberg, Bjorn; Hjollo, Torunn; Langeland, Nina; Hanevik, Kurt] Univ Bergen, Dept Clin Sci, Bergen, Norway; [Moyo, Sabrina J.; Maselle, Samuel Y.] Muhimbili Univ Hlth & Allied Sci, Dept Microbiol & Immunol, Dar Es Salaam, Tanzania; [Blomberg, Bjorn; Langeland, Nina] Haukeland Hosp, Dept Med, N-5021 Bergen, Norway","Tellevik, MG (reprint author), Haukeland Hosp, Natl Ctr Trop Infect Dis, Dept Med, N-5021 Bergen, Norway.",marit.gjerde.tellevik@helse-bergen.no,"Hanevik, Kurt/I-1159-2012","Hanevik, Kurt/0000-0002-1466-2326","University of Bergen, Norway; National Centre for Tropical Infectious Diseases, Haukeland University Hospital, Norway","This study was supported by the University of Bergen, Norway, and by the National Centre for Tropical Infectious Diseases, Haukeland University Hospital, Norway.

Delayed occurrence of symptoms is observed in humans using chemoprophylaxis, or patients having received therapies targeting P. falciparum intraerythrocytic asexual stages, but few investigators have addressed the biological basis of the ability of P. malariae to persist in the human host. To investigate these interesting features of P. malariae epidemiology, we assembled, here, an extensive case series of P. malariae malaria patients presenting in non-endemic China, Sweden, and the UK who returned from travel in endemic countries, mainly in Africa. Out of 378 evaluable P. malariae cases, 100 (26.2%) reported using at least partial chemoprophylaxis, resembling the pattern seen with the relapsing parasites P. ovale spp. and P. vivax. In contrast, for only 7.5% of imported UK cases of non-relapsing P. falciparum was any chemoprophylaxis use reported. Genotyping of parasites from six patients reporting use of atovaquone-proguanil chemoprophylaxis did not reveal mutations at codon 268 of the cytb locus of the P. malariae mitochondrial genome. While travellers with P. malariae malaria are significantly more likely to report prophylaxis use during endemic country travel than are those with P. falciparum infections, atovaquone-proguanil prophylaxis breakthrough was not associated with pmcytb mutations. These preliminary studies, together with consistent observations of the remarkable longevity of P. malariae, lead us to propose re-examination of the dogma that this species is not a relapsing parasite. Further studies are needed to investigate our favoured hypothesis, namely that P. malariae can initiate a latent hypnozoite developmental programme in the human hepatocyte: if validated this will explain the consistent observations of remarkable longevity of parasitism, even in the presence of antimalarial prophylaxis or treatment.","[Teo, Beatrix Huei-Yi; Beshir, Khalid B.; Sutherland, Colin J.] London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, Fac Infect & Trop Dis, Dept Immunol & Infect, London WC1, England; [Lansdell, Paul; Smith, Valerie; Blaze, Marie; Nolder, Debbie; Chiodini, Peter L.; Sutherland, Colin J.] London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, Publ Hlth England Malaria Reference Lab, London WC1, England; [Chiodini, Peter L.; Sutherland, Colin J.] Hosp Trop Dis, Dept Clin Parasitol, London NW1 0PE, England; [Cao, Jun] Jiangsu Inst Parasit Dis, Wuxi, Peoples R China; [Farnert, Anna] Karolinska Inst, Dept Med Solna, Stockholm, Sweden; [Farnert, Anna] Karolinska Univ Hosp, Dept Infect Dis, Stockholm, Sweden","Teo, BHY (reprint author), London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, Fac Infect & Trop Dis, Dept Immunol & Infect, London WC1, England.",colin.sutherland@lshtm.ac.uk,,"Beshir, Khalid/0000-0001-5108-8362",Public Health England (Malaria Reference Service contract); National Natural Science Foundation of China [81271870]; Jiangsu Province's Medical High Tech Platform [ZX201108]; Swedish Research Council; Stockholm County Council,"This work was supported by Public Health England (Malaria Reference Service contract awarded to CJS), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (grant 81271870, awarded to JC), the Jiangsu Province's Medical High Tech Platform (grant ZX201108, awarded to JC) and grant funding from the Swedish Research Council and Stockholm County Council to AF.

Although leptospirosis can cause life-threatening disease, there is no global burden of disease estimate in terms of Disability Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) available. Methodology/Principal Findings We utilised the results of a parallel publication that reported global estimates of morbidity and mortality due to leptospirosis. We estimated Years of Life Lost (YLLs) from age and gender stratified mortality rates. Years of Life with Disability (YLDs) were developed from a simple disease model indicating likely sequelae. DALYs were estimated from the sum of YLLs and YLDs. The study suggested that globally approximately 2.90 million DALYs are lost per annum (UIs 1.25-4.54 million) from the approximately annual 1.03 million cases reported previously. Males are predominantly affected with an estimated 2.33 million DALYs (UIs 0.98-3.69) or approximately 80% of the total burden. For comparison, this is over 70% of the global burden of cholera estimated by GBD 2010. Tropical regions of South and South-east Asia, Western Pacific, Central and South America, and Africa had the highest estimated leptospirosis disease burden. Conclusions/Significance Leptospirosis imparts a significant health burden worldwide, which approach or exceed those encountered for a number of other zoonotic and neglected tropical diseases. The study findings indicate that highest burden estimates occur in resource-poor tropical countries, which include regions of Africa where the burden of leptospirosis has been under-appreciated and possibly misallocated to other febrile illnesses such as malaria.","[Torgerson, Paul R.] Univ Zurich, Epidemiol Sect, Vetsuisse Fac, Zurich, Switzerland; [Hagan, Jose E.; Costa, Federico; Calcagno, Juan; Martinez-Silveira, Martha S.; Ko, Albert I.] Fundacao Oswaldo Cruz, Minist Saude, Salvador, BA, Brazil; [Hagan, Jose E.; Costa, Federico; Ko, Albert I.] Yale Univ, Dept Epidemiol Microbial Dis, Sch Publ Hlth, New Haven, CT USA; [Costa, Federico] Fed Univ Bahia UFBA, Inst Collect Hlth, Salvador, BA, Brazil; [Kane, Michael] Yale Univ, Ctr Analyt Sci, Sch Publ Hlth, New Haven, CT USA; [Goris, Marga G.

Notably, the specific transfer and sialidase activities of these TconTS differ by orders of magnitude. Surprisingly, phylogenetic analysis of the catalytic domains (CD) grouped each of the highly active TconTS together with the less active enzymes. In contrast, when aligning lectin-like domains (LD), the highly active TconTS grouped together, leading to the hypothesis that the LD of TconTS modulates its enzymatic activity. So far, little is known about the function and ligand specificity of these LDs. To explore their carbohydrate-binding potential, glycan array analysis was performed on the LD of TconTS1, TconTS2, TconTS3 and TconTS4. In addition, Saturation Transfer Difference (STD) NMR experiments were done on TconTS2-LD for a more detailed analysis of its lectin activity. Several mannose-containing oligosaccharides, such as mannobiose, mannotriose and higher mannosylated glycans, as well as Gal, GalNAc and LacNAc containing oligosaccharides were confirmed as binding partners of TconTS1-LD and TconTS2-LD. Interestingly, terminal mannose residues are not acceptor substrates for TconTS activity. This indicates a different, yet unknown biological function for TconTS-LD, including specific interactions with oligomannose-containing glycans on glycoproteins and GPI anchors found on the surface of the parasite, including the TconTS itself. Experimental evidence for such a scenario is presented.","[Waespy, Mario; Gbem, Thaddeus T.; Elenschneider, Leroy; Jeck, Andre-Philippe; Kelm, Sorge] Univ Bremen, Fac Biol & Chem, Ctr Biomol Interact Bremen, D-28359 Bremen, Germany; [Gbem, Thaddeus T.; Kelm, Sorge] Ahmadu Bello Univ, Africa Ctr Excellence Neglected Trop Dis & Forens, Zaria, Nigeria; [Day, Christopher J.; Hartley-Tassell, Lauren; Tiralongo, Joe; Haselhorst, Thomas; Kelm, Sorge] Griffith Univ, Inst Glyc, Nathan, Qld 4111, Australia; [Bovin, Nicolai] Russian Acad Sci, Shemyakin Inst Bioorgan Chem, Moscow, Russia","Kelm, S (reprint author), Univ Bremen, Fac Biol & Chem, Ctr Biomol Interact Bremen, D-28359 Bremen, Germany.",skelm@uni-bremen.de,"Bovin, Nicolai/P-2948-2017; Kelm, Soerge/C-5403-2013","Bovin, Nicolai/0000-0001-8669-4477; Kelm, Soerge/0000-0001-5277-9421; Day, Christopher/0000-0001-7953-4408; Gbem, Thaddeus/0000-0002-2366-0082; Tiralongo, Joe/0000-0002-3529-6310","Australian Research Council; Russian Science Foundadion (RSF) [14-50-00131]; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft [DFG Ke 428/8-1, DFG Ke 428/10-1]; World Bank (Africa Centre of Excellence for Tropical Neglected Diseases and Forensic Biotechnology)","TH thanks the Australian Research Council for the award of an Australian Future Fellowship.

Despite this, the viral mediators of protective immunity against alphaviruses are poorly understood, highlighted by the lack of a licensed human vaccine for any member of this virus genus. The alphavirus E2, the receptor-binding envelope protein, is considered to be the predominant target of the protective host immune response. Although envelope protein domains have been studied for vaccine and neutralization in flaviviruses, their role in alphaviruses is less characterized. Here, we describe the role of the alphavirus E2 domains in neutralization and protection through the use of chimeric viruses. Methodology/Principal Findings Four chimeric viruses were constructed in which individual E2 domains of CHIKV were replaced with the corresponding domain from Semliki Forest virus (SFV) (Delta DomA/Delta DomB/Delta DomC/Delta DomA+B). Vaccination studies in mice (both live and inactivated virus) revealed that domain B was the primary determinant of neutralization. Neutralization studies with CHIKV immune serum from humans were consistent with mouse studies, as Delta DomB was poorly neutralized. Conclusions/Significance Using chimeric viruses, it was determined that the alphavirus E2 domain B was the critical target of neutralizing antibodies in both mice and humans. Therefore, chimeric viruses may have more relevance for vaccine discovery than peptide-based approaches, which only detect linear epitopes. This study provides new insight into the role of alphavirus E2 domains on neutralization determinants and may be useful for the design of novel therapeutic technologies.","[Weger-Lucarelli, James; Aliota, Matthew T.; Kamlangdee, Attapon; Osorio, Jorge E.] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Pathobiol Sci, Madison, WI 53706 USA","Weger-Lucarelli, J (reprint author), Univ Wisconsin, Dept Pathobiol Sci, Madison, WI 53706 USA.",weger@wisc.edu,,"Aliota, Matthew/0000-0002-6902-9149; Weger-Lucarelli, James/0000-0002-9483-1694",NIH [AI093491-02],"This work was supported by NIH grant #AI093491-02.

Control is hindered by limited understanding of the ecology of potential vector species. Methodology/Principal Findings We conducted a one year longitudinal study of P. knowlesi vectors in three sites within an endemic area of Sabah, Malaysia. All mosquitoes were captured using human landing catch. Anopheles mosquitoes were dissected to determine, oocyst, sporozoites and parous rate. Anopheles balabacensis is confirmed as the primary vector of. P. knowlesi (using nested PCR) in Sabah for the first time. Vector densities were significantly higher and more seasonally variable in the village than forest or small scale farming site. However An. balabacensis survival and P. knowlesi infection rates were highest in forest and small scale farm sites. Anopheles balabacensis mostly bites humans outdoors in the early evening between 1800 to 2000hrs. Conclusions/Significance This study indicates transmission is unlikely to be prevented by bednets. This combined with its high vectorial capacity poses a threat to malaria elimination programmes within the region.","[Wong, Meng L.; Leong, Cherng S.; Khaw, Loke T.; Wan-Sulaiman, Wan-Yusoff; Vythilingam, Indra] Univ Malaya, Fac Med, Dept Parasitol, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia; [Chua, Tock H.] Univ Sabah Malaysia, Fac Med & Hlth Sci, Dept Pathobiol & Med Diagnost, Kota Kinabalu, Sabah, Malaysia; [Fornace, Kimberly; Drakeley, Chris] London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, Fac Infect & Trop Dis, London WC1, England; [William, Timothy] Jesselton Med Ctr, Kota Kinabalu, Saga, Malaysia; [Ferguson, Heather M.] Univ Glasgow, Inst Biodivers Anim Hlth & Comparat Med, Glasgow G12 8QQ, Lanark, Scotland","Wong, ML (reprint author), Univ Malaya, Fac Med, Dept Parasitol, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.",indra.vythilingam@gmail.com,"VYTHILINGAM, INDRA/Q-5019-2016; Wan Sulaiman, Wan Yusoff/L-5295-2016; Chua, Tock H/E-4157-2012; Vythilingam, Indra/E-8334-2010; sulaiman, wan yusoff wan/C-1030-2010","Chua, Tock H/0000-0002-8984-8723; Fornace, Kimberly/0000-0002-5484-241X; Ferguson, Heather/0000-0002-9625-5176",University of Malaya High Impact Research Grant [UM.C/625/1/HIR/099 J-20011-73822]; University of Malaya student Grant [IPP 105-2014A]; Medical Research Council; Natural Environment Research Council; Economic and Social Research Council; Biotechnology and Biosciences Research Council; MRC [G1100796]; Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council [1517720]; Medical Research Council [G1100796],"This study was supported by: University of Malaya High Impact Research Grant UM.C/625/1/HIR/099 J-20011-73822; University of Malaya student Grant IPP 105-2014A, Medical Research Council, Natural Environment Research Council, Economic and Social Research Council, and Biotechnology and Biosciences Research Council for the funding received for this project through the Environmental & Social Ecology of Human Infectious Diseases Initiative (ESEI), MRC Grant Number: G1100796.

Specific control methods include mass drug administration (MDA) and health education to reduce raw fish consumption. These control efforts have greatly shifted the epidemiology of Opisthorchis viverrini (OV) infection over the last decade from presenting as densely concentrated ""heavy"" infections in single villages to widespread ""light"" OV infections distributed over wide geographical areas. Currently, the ""gold standard"" detection method for OV infection is formalin ethyl-acetate concentration technique (FECT), which has limited diagnostic sensitivity and diagnostic specificity for light OV infections, with OV eggs often confused with eggs of minute intestinal flukes (MIFs) in feces. In this study, we developed and evaluated the diagnostic performance of a monoclonal antibody-based enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for the measurement of OV excretory-secretory (ES) antigens in urine (urine OV-ES assay) for the diagnosis of opisthorchiasis compared to the gold standard detection FECT method. Methodology We tested several methods for pre-treating urine samples prior to testing the diagnostic performance of the urine OV-ES assay. Using trichloroacetic acid (TCA) pre-treated urine, we compared detection and quantification of OV infection using the urine OV-ES assay versus FECT in OV-endemic areas in Northeastern Thailand. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were used to determine the diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of the urine OV-ES assay using TCA pre-treated urine, and to establish diagnostic positivity thresholds. The Positive Predictive Value as well as the likelihood of obtaining a positive test result (LR+) or a negative test result (LR-) were calculated for the established diagnostic positivity threshold. Diagnostic risks (Odds Ratios) were estimated using logistic regression. Results When urine samples were pre-treated with TCA prior to use in the urine OV-ES assay, the analytical sensitivity was significantly improved. Using TCA pre-treatment of urine, the urine OV-ES assay had a limit of detection (LoD) of 39 ng/ml compared to the LoD of 52 ng/mL reported for coprological antigen detection methods. Similarly, the urine OV-ES assay correlated significantly with intensity of OV infection as measured by FECT. The urine OV-ES assay was also able to detect 28 individuals as positive from the 63 (44.4%) individuals previously determined to be negative using FECT. The likelihood of a positive diagnosis of OV infection by urine OV-ES assay increased significantly with the intensity of OV infection as determined by FECT. With reference to FECT, the sensitivity and specificity of the urine OV-ES assay was 81% and 70%, respectively. Conclusion The detection of OV-infection by the urine OV-ES assay showed much greater diagnostic sensitivity and diagnostic specificity than the current ""gold standard"" FECT method for the detection and quantification of OV infection. Due to its ease-of-use, and noninvasive sample collection (urine), the urine OV-ES assay offers the potential to revolutionize the diagnosis of liver fluke infection and provide an effective tool for control and elimination of these tumorigenic parasites.","[Worasith, Chanika; Sithithaworn, Paiboon] Khon Kaen Univ, Fac Med, Dept Parasitol, Khon Kaen 40002, Thailand; [Worasith, Chanika; Wangboon, Chompunoot; Namwat, Nisana; Techasen, Anchalee; Loilome, Watcharin; Yongvanit, Puangrat; Sithithaworn, Paiboon] Khon Kaen Univ, Fac Med, Liver Fluke & Cholangiocarcinoma Res Ctr, Khon Kaen, Thailand; [Kamamia, Christine; Yakovleva, Anna; Bethony, Jeffrey M.] George Washington Univ, Sch Med & Hlth Sci, Dept Microbiol Immunol & Trop Med, Washington, DC 20052 USA; [Kamamia, Christine; Yakovleva, Anna; Bethony, Jeffrey M.] George Washington Univ, Sch Med & Hlth Sci, Res Ctr Neglected Dis Poverty, Washington, DC 20052 USA; [Duenngai, Kunyarat] Phetchabun Rajabhat Univ, Fac Sci & Technol, Dept Publ Hlth, Phetchabun, Thailand; [Wangboon, Chompunoot] Khon Kaen Univ, Grad Sch, Program Biomed Sci, Khon Kaen, Thailand; [Sithithaworn, Jiraporn; Techasen, Anchalee] Khon Kaen Univ, Fac Associated Med Sci, Khon Kaen, Thailand; [Watwiengkam, Nattaya] Mahasarakham Univ, Dept Preclin Vet Sci, Fac Vet Sci, Maha Sarakham, Thailand; [Namwat, Nisana; Loilome, Watcharin; Yongvanit, Puangrat] Khon Kaen Univ, Dept Biochem, Fac Med, Khon Kaen, Thailand; [Loukas, Alex] James Cook Univ, Queensland Trop Hlth Alliance, Ctr Biodivers & Mol Dev Therapeut, Cairns, Qld, Australia","Worasith, C (reprint author), Khon Kaen Univ, Fac Med, Dept Parasitol, Khon Kaen 40002, Thailand.",paibsit@gmail.com,"Loukas, Alex/B-7355-2014","Loukas, Alex/0000-0002-0896-8441","Higher Education Research Promotion and National Research University Project of Thailand, Office of the Higher Education Commission, through the Center of Excellence in Specific Health Problems in Greater Mekong Sub-region Cluster (SHeP-GMS) [NRU54204]; Basic Research Grant; Thailand Research Fund; Target Research Fund [TR54101]; Invitation Research Fund, Faculty of Medicine, Khon Kaen University, Thailand [I57109]; National Cancer Institute [R01CA155297]; National Health and Medical Research Council of Australia [1051627]","This work was supported by the Higher Education Research Promotion and National Research University Project of Thailand, Office of the Higher Education Commission, through the Center of Excellence in Specific Health Problems in Greater Mekong Sub-region Cluster (SHeP-GMS, Project No. NRU54204 to CWo).

In this systematic review, we aimed to summarise and compare current knowledge of: (1) the geographic distribution, prevalence, incidence and diversity of acute human leptospirosis in Africa; and (2) the geographic distribution, host range, prevalence and diversity of Leptospira spp. infection in animal hosts in Africa. Methods Following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, we searched for studies that described (1) acute human leptospirosis and (2) pathogenic Leptospira spp. infection in animals. We performed a literature search using eight international and regional databases for English and non-English articles published between January 1930 to October 2014 that met out pre-defined inclusion criteria and strict case definitions. Results and Discussion We identified 97 studies that described acute human leptospirosis (n = 46) or animal Leptospira infection (n = 51) in 26 African countries. The prevalence of acute human leptospirosis ranged from 2 3% to 19 8% (n = 11) in hospital patients with febrile illness. Incidence estimates were largely restricted to the Indian Ocean islands (3 to 101 cases per 100,000 per year (n = 6)). Data from Tanzania indicate that human disease incidence is also high in mainland Africa (75 to 102 cases per 100,000 per year). Three major species (Leptospira borgpetersenii, L. interrogans and L. kirschneri) are predominant in reports from Africa and isolates from a diverse range of serogroups have been reported in human and animal infections. Cattle appear to be important hosts of a large number of Leptospira serogroups in Africa, but few data are available to allow comparison of Leptospira infection in linked human and animal populations. We advocate a 'One Health' approach to promote multidisciplinary research efforts to improve understanding of the animal to human transmission of leptospirosis on the African continent.","[Allan, Kathryn J.; Halliday, Jo E.

In this study, we prospectively analyzed the potential parasitocidal effect of benzimidazoles and whether normalization of FDG-PET/CT scans and anti-Emll/3-10-antibody levels could act as reliable ""in vivo"" parameters of AE-inactivation permitting to abrogate chemotherapy with a low risk for AE-recurrence. Method This prospective study included 34 patients with non-resectable AE subdivided into group A (n = 11), followed-up after diagnosis and begin of chemotherapy at months 6, 12 and 24, and group B (n = 23) with a medium duration of chemotherapy of 10 (range 2-25) years. All patients were assessed by FDG-PET/CT examinations and anti-EmII/3-10 serology. Chemotherapy was abrogated in patients with normalization of FDG-PET/CT and serum antiEmII/3-10 levels. These patients were closely followed-up for AE recurrence. Endpoint (parasitocidal efficacy) was defined by the absence of AE-recurrence >24 months after stopping treatment. Results Normalization of FDG-PET/CT scan and anti-EmII/3-10 levels occurred in 11 of 34 patients (32%). After abrogation of chemotherapy in these 11 patients, there was no evidence of AE-recurrence within a median of 70.5 (range 16-82) months. However, the patients' immunocompetence appears pivotal for the described long-term parasitocidal effect of benzimidazoles. Conclusions The combination of negative FDG-PET/ CT-scans and anti-EmII/3-10 antibody levels seem to be reliable parameters for assessing in vivo AE-larval inactivity after long-term benzimidazole chemotherapy.","[Ammann, Rudolf W.; Huber, Sabine; Bertogg, Kaja; Muellhaupt, Beat] Univ Zurich Hosp, Dept Gastroenterol & Hepatol, CH-8091 Zurich, Switzerland; [Stumpe, Katrin D.

In the United States, cryptosporidiosis occurs in an estimated 750,000 persons annually, and is primarily caused by either of the Cryptosporidium parvum genotypes 1 and 2, exposure to which occurs through ingestion of food or water contaminated with oocytes shed from infected hosts. Although most cryptosporidiosis cases are caused by genotype 1 and are of human origin, the zoonotic sources of genotype 2, such as livestock, are increasingly recognized as important for understanding human disease patterns. Social inequality could mediate patterns of human exposure and infection by placing individuals in environments where food or water contamination and livestock contact is high or through reducing the availability of educational and sanitary resources required to avoid exposure. Methodology/Principal Findings We here analyzed data from the National Health and Nutritional Examination Survey (NHANES) between 1999 and 2000, and related seropositivity to Cryptosporidium parvum to correlates of social inequality at the household and individual scale. After accounting for the complex sampling design of NHANES and confounding by individual demographics and household conditions, we found impaired household food adequacy was associated with greater odds of Cryptosporidium seropositivity. Additionally, we identified individuals of non-white race and ethnicity and those born outside the United States as having significantly greater risk than white, domestic-born counterparts. Furthermore, we provide suggestive evidence for direct effects of family wealth on Cryptosporidium seropositivity, in that persons from low-income households and from families close to the poverty threshold had elevated odds of seropositivity relative to those in high-income families and in households far above the poverty line. Conclusions/Significance These results refute assertions that cryptosporidiosis in the United States is independent of social marginalization and poverty, and carry implications for targeted public health interventions for Cryptosporidium infection in resource-poor groups. Future longitudinal and multilevel studies are necessary to elucidate the complex interactions between ecological factors, social inequality, and Cryptosporidium dynamics.","[Becker, Daniel J.] Univ Georgia, Odum Sch Ecol, Athens, GA 30602 USA; [Oloya, James; Ezeamama, Amara E.] Univ Georgia, Coll Publ Hlth, Dept Epidemiol & Biostat, Athens, GA 30602 USA","Becker, DJ (reprint author), Univ Georgia, Odum Sch Ecol, Athens, GA 30602 USA.",aezeamam@uga.edu,"Becker, Daniel/A-6466-2014","Becker, Daniel/0000-0003-4315-8628",National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship; Achievement Rewards for College Students Foundation Award,"This work was supported by a National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship (https://www.nsfgrfp.org/) and Achievement Rewards for College Students Foundation Award (https://www.arcsfoundation.org/) to DJB.

Although anthelminthic drugs which are used for MDA are supplied by two pharmaceutical companies through donation, there is a wide range of brands available on local markets for which the efficacy against STHs and quality remain poorly explored. In the present study, we evaluated the drug efficacy and quality of two albendazole brands (Bendex and Ovis) available on the local market in Ethiopia. Methodology/Principal Findings A randomized clinical trial was conducted according to the World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines to assess drug efficacy, by means of egg reduction rate (ERR), of Bendex and Ovis against STH infections in school children in Jimma, Ethiopia. In addition, the chemical and physicochemical quality of the drugs was assessed according to the United States and European Pharmacopoeia, encompassing mass uniformity of the tablets, amount of active compound and dissolution profile. Both drugs were highly efficacious against A. lumbricoides (>97%), but showed poor efficacy against T. trichiura (similar to 20%). For hookworms, Ovis was significantly (p < 0.05) more efficacious compared to Bendex (98.1% vs. 88.7%). Assessment of the physicochemical quality of the drugs revealed a significant difference in dissolution profile, with Bendex having a slower dissolution than Ovis. Conclusion/Significance The study revealed that differences in efficacy between the two brands of albendazole (ABZ) tablets against hookworm are linked to the differences in the in-vitro drug release profile. Differences in uptake and metabolism of this benzimidazole drug among different helminth species may explain that this efficacy difference was only observed in hookworms and not in the two other species. The results of the present study underscore the importance of assessing the chemical and physicochemical quality of drugs before conducting efficacy assessment in any clinical trials to ensure appropriate therapeutic efficacy and to exclude poor drug quality as a factor of reduced drug efficacy other than anthelminthic resistance. Overall, this paper demonstrates that ""all medicines are not created equal"".","[Belew, Sileshi; Suleman, Sultan; Mohammed, Tesfaye; Deti, Habetewold] Jimma Univ, Sch Pharm, Jimma, Ethiopia; [Belew, Sileshi; Suleman, Sultan; D'Hondt, Matthias; Wynendaele, Evelien; De Spiegeleer, Bart] Univ Ghent, Drug Qual & Registrat Grp, Dept Pharmaceut Anal, Fac Pharmaceut Sci, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium; [Getachew, Mestawet] Jimma Univ, Jimma Univ Specialized Hosp, Jimma, Ethiopia; [Mekonnen, Zeleke] Jimma Univ, Dept Med Lab Sci & Pathol, Jimma, Ethiopia; [Vercruysse, Jozef; Levecke, Bruno] Univ Ghent, Dept Virol Parasitol & Immunol, Fac Vet Med, Merelbeke, Belgium; [Duchateau, Luc] Univ Ghent, Dept Comparat Physiol & Biometr, Fac Vet Med, Merelbeke, Belgium","Belew, S (reprint author), Jimma Univ, Sch Pharm, Jimma, Ethiopia.",Bart.Despiegeleer@UGent.be; Bruno.Levecke@UGent.be,"De Spiegeleer, Bart/A-2001-2008","De Spiegeleer, Bart/0000-0001-6794-3108; Levecke, Bruno/0000-0001-8912-5595","F.W.O.-Vlaanderen [FWO12/PDO/099]; BOF (Special Research Fund) [01W03714, DOZA/ILDDC/AM/0866b-2014]","BL is a postdoctoral fellow of the Fund for Scientific Research-Flanders (Belgium) (F.W.O.-Vlaanderen, grant no.

Human TB caused by M. bovis is considered a zoonosis; transmission is mainly through consumption of unpasteurized dairy products, and it is less frequently attributed to animal-to-human or human-to-human contact. We describe the trends of M. bovis isolation from human samples and first-line drug susceptibility during a 15-year period in a referral laboratory located in a tertiary care hospital in Mexico City. Methodology/Principal Findings Data on mycobacterial isolates from human clinical samples were retrieved from the laboratory's database for the 2000-2014 period. Susceptibility to first-line drugs: rifampin, isoniazid, streptomycin (STR) and ethambutol was determined. We identified 1,165 isolates, 73.7% were M. tuberculosis and 26.2%, M. bovis. Among pulmonary samples, 16.6% were M. bovis. The proportion of M. bovis isolates significantly increased from 7.8% in 2000 to 28.4% in 2014 (X-2 (trend), p< 0.001). Primary STR resistance was higher among M. bovis compared with M. tuberculosis isolates (10.9% vs. 3.4%, p< 0.001). Secondary multidrug resistance (MDR) rates were 38.5% and 34.4% for M. bovis and M. tuberculosis, respectively (p = 0.637). A rising trend of primary STR monoresistance was observed for both species (3.4% in 2000-2004 vs. 7.6% in 2010-2014; p = 0.02). Conclusions/Significance There is a high prevalence and a rising trend of M. bovis isolates in our region. The proportion of pulmonary M. bovis isolates is higher than in previous reports. Additionally, we report high rates of primary anti-tuberculosis resistance and secondary MDR in both M. tuberculosis and M. bovis. This is one of the largest reports on drug susceptibility of M. bovis from human samples and shows a significant proportion of first-line anti-tuberculosis drug resistance.","[Bobadilla-del Valle, Miriam; Torres-Gonzalez, Pedro; Enrique Cervera-Hernandez, Miguel; Martinez-Gamboa, Areli; Chavez-Mazari, Barbara; Ortiz-Conchi, Narciso; Rodriguez-Cruz, Luis; Cervantes-Sanchez, Axel; Gudino-Enriquez, Tomasa; Cinta-Severo, Carmen; Ponce de Leon, Alfredo] Inst Nacl Ciencias Med & Nutr Salvador Zubiran, Dept Infect Dis, Lab Clin Microbiol, Mexico City, DF, Mexico; [Crabtree-Ramirez, Brenda] Inst Nacl Ciencias Med & Nutr Salvador Zubiran, Dept Infect Dis, HIV Clin, Mexico City, DF, Mexico; [Sifuentes-Osornio, Jose] Inst Nacl Ciencias Med & Nutr Salvador Zubiran, Dept Med, Mexico City, DF, Mexico","Valle, MBD (reprint author), Inst Nacl Ciencias Med & Nutr Salvador Zubiran, Dept Infect Dis, Lab Clin Microbiol, Mexico City, DF, Mexico.",sifuentesosornio@gmail.com; alf.poncedeleon@gmail.com,,"Ponce-de-Leon, Alfredo/0000-0003-2640-2916; Cervera-Hernandez, Miguel/0000-0002-2854-243X; Crabtree-Ramirez, Brenda/0000-0002-2587-1123; BOBADILLA-DEL VALLE, MIRIAM/0000-0003-1184-827X",,,,39,4,4,0,9,PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE,SAN FRANCISCO,"1160 BATTERY STREET, STE 100, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94111 USA",1935-2735,,,PLOS NEGLECT TROP D,Plos Neglect.

The pathogenesis of TL, however, is still not fully understood. Clinical manifestations vary from cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) to more severe outcomes, such as disseminated leishmaniasis (DL), mucosal leishmaniasis (ML) and diffuse cutaneous leishmaniasis (DCL). Many factors have been associated with the severity of the disease and the development of lesions. Recent studies have reported that the presence of Leishmania RNA virus 1 infecting Leishmania (Leishmania RNA virus 1, LRV1) is an important factor associated with the severity of ML in experimental animal models. In the present study, 156 patients who attended Rondonia's Hospital of Tropical Medicine with both leishmaniasis clinical diagnoses (109 CL; 38 ML; 5 CL+ML; 3 DL and 1 DCL) and molecular diagnoses were investigated. The clinical diagnosis were confirmed by PCR by targeting hsp70 and kDNA DNA sequences and the species causing the infection were determined by HSP70 PCR-RFPL. The presence of LVR1 was tested by RT-PCR. Five Leishmania species were detected: 121 (77.6%) samples were positive for Leishmania (Viannia) braziliensis, 18 (11.5%) were positive for Leishmania (V.) guyanensis, 3 (1.8%) for Leishmania (V.) lainsoni, 2 (1.3%) for Leishmania (Leishmania) amazonensis and 2 (1.3%) for Leishmania (V.) shawi. Six (3.9%) samples were positive for Leishmania sp. but the species could not be determined, and 4 (2.6%) samples were suggestive of mixed infection by L. (V.) braziliensis and L. (V.) guyanensis. The virus was detected in L. braziliensis (N = 54), L. guyanensis (N = 5), L. amazonensis (N = 2), L. lainsoni (N = 1) and inconclusive samples (N = 6). Patients presenting with CL+ ML, DL and DCL were excluded from further analysis. Association between the presence of the virus and the disease outcome were tested among the remaining 147 patients (CL = 109 and ML = 38). Of them, 71.1% (n = 27) mucosal lesions were positive for LRV1, and 28.9% (n = 11) were negative. In cutaneous lesions, 36.7%(n = 40) were positive and 63.3%(n = 69) were negative for LRV1. The ratio P(ML vertical bar LRV1+)/P(ML vertical bar LRV1-) was 2.93 (CI95% 1.57...5.46; p< 0.001), thus corroborating the hypothesis of the association between LRV1 and the occurrence of mucosal leishmaniasis, as previously described in animal models; it also indicates that LRV1 is not the only factor contributing to the disease outcome.","[Cantanhede, Lilian Motta; Felipin, Katia Paula; Nicolete, Roberto; Villalobos Salcedo, Juan Miguel; Mattos Ferreira, Ricardo de Godoi] Fundacao Oswaldo Cruz, Unidade Rondonia, Porto Velho, Rondonia, Brazil; [da Silva Junior, Cipriano Ferreira; Ito, Marcos Massayuki] Governo Estado Rondonia, Secretaria Saude, Porto Velho, Rondonia, Brazil; [Porrozzi, Renato; Cupolillo, Elisa] Inst Oswaldo Cruz, Lab Pesquisa Leishmaniose, BR-20001 Rio De Janeiro, Brazil","Cantanhede, LM (reprint author), Fundacao Oswaldo Cruz, Unidade Rondonia, Porto Velho, Rondonia, Brazil.",licantanhede@gmail.com,"Ferreira, Ricardo/C-7920-2012; Cantanhede, Lilian M/L-2451-2014","Ferreira, Ricardo/0000-0003-2363-1289; Cantanhede, Lilian M/0000-0002-2376-4236; Porrozzi, Renato/0000-0003-2167-316X; Cupolillo, Elisa/0000-0002-0620-3250",CAPES; DECIT/SCTIE/MS-CNPq,"This work was supported by CAPES (www.capes.gov.br) and DECIT/SCTIE/MS (www.saude.gov.br)-CNPq (www.cnpq.br).

Clinical presentations of BU lesions are classically classified as papules, nodules, plaques and edematous infiltration, ulcer or osteomyelitis. Within these different clinical forms, lesions can be further classified as severe forms based on focality (multiple lesions), lesions' size (> 15cm diameter) or WHO Category (WHO Category 3 lesions). There are studies reporting an association between delay in seeking medical care and the development of ulcerative forms of BU or osteomyelitis, but the effect of time-delay on the emergence of lesions classified as severe has not been addressed. To address both issues, and in a cohort of laboratory-confirmed BU cases, 476 patients from a medical center in Allada, Benin, were studied. In this laboratory-confirmed cohort, we validated previous observations, demonstrating that time-delay is statistically related to the clinical form of BU. Indeed, for non-ulcerated forms (nodule, edema, and plaque) the median time-delay was 32.5 days (IQR 30.0-67.5), while for ulcerated forms it was 60 days (IQR 20.0-120.0) (p = 0.009), and for bone lesions, 365 days (IQR 228.0-548.0). On the other hand, we show here that time-delay is not associated with the more severe phenotypes of BU, such as multi-focal lesions (median 90 days; IQR 56-217.5; p = 0.09), larger lesions (diameter > 15cm) (median 60 days; IQR 30-120; p = 0.92) or category 3 WHO classification (median 60 days; IQR 30-150; p = 0.20), when compared with unifocal (median 60 days; IQR 30-90), small lesions (diameter <= 15cm) (median 60 days; IQR 30-90), or WHO category 1+2 lesions (median 60 days; IQR 30-90), respectively. Our results demonstrate that after an initial period of progression towards ulceration or bone involvement, BU lesions become stable regarding size and focal/multi-focal progression. Therefore, in future studies on BU epidemiology, severe clinical forms should be systematically considered as distinct phenotypes of the same disease and thus subjected to specific risk factor investigation.","[Capela, Carlos; Dossou, Ange D.; Costa, Patrcio; Fraga, Alexandra G.; Menino, Joao F.; Silva-Gomes, Rita; Rodrigues, Fernando; Pedrosa, Jorge] Univ Minho, Sch Hlth Sci, Life & Hlth Sci Res Inst ICVS, Braga, Portugal; [Capela, Carlos; Dossou, Ange D.; Costa, Patrcio; Fraga, Alexandra G.; Menino, Joao F.; Silva-Gomes, Rita; Rodrigues, Fernando; Pedrosa, Jorge] Univ Minho, ICVS PT Govt Associate Lab 3Bs, Braga, Portugal; [Sopoh, Ghislain E.; Houezo, Jean G.; Fiodessihoue, Rene] Buruli Ulcer Treatment Ctr Allada, Allada, Benin; [Ouendo, Edgard M.] Reg Inst Publ Hlth, Ouidah, Benin","Pedrosa, J (reprint author), Univ Minho, Sch Hlth Sci, Life & Hlth Sci Res Inst ICVS, Braga, Portugal.",jpedrosa@ecsaude.uminho.pt,"Pedrosa, Jorge/H-4877-2011; Costa, Patricio/A-3072-2013; Rodrigues, Fernando/T-5299-2018; Costa, Patricio/H-3051-2019; Fraga, Alexandra/T-5174-2018; Capela, Carlos/E-1566-2018","Pedrosa, Jorge/0000-0002-8204-4888; Costa, Patricio/0000-0002-1201-9177; Rodrigues, Fernando/0000-0001-8436-9398; Fraga, Alexandra/0000-0003-2029-1629; Capela, Carlos/0000-0002-0450-7103; SOPOH, Ghislain Emmanuel/0000-0003-1237-1047; Menino, Joao/0000-0003-3778-1747",Health Services of the Fundacao Calouste Gulbenkian [94776]; Fundacao para a Ciecia e Tecnologia (FCT); Programa Operacional Regional do Norte [ON.2-O Novo Norte]; Quadro de Referencia Estrategico Nacional (QREN) through the Fundo Europeu de Desenvolvimento Regional (FEDER); Projeto Estrategico - LA 26 [PEst-C/SAU/LA0026/2013]; FCT [SFRH/BPD/68547/2010]; QREN [UMINHO/BPD/14/2014],"The research leading to these results received funding from the Health Services of the Fundacao Calouste Gulbenkian under the grant Proc.

The objectives of this study were to evaluate the temporal relationship between meteorological variables, entomological surveillance indices and confirmed dengue cases; and to establish the threshold for entomological surveillance indices including three mosquito larval indices [Breteau (BI), Container (CI) and House indices (HI)] and one adult index (AI) as an early warning tool for dengue epidemic. Methodology/Principal Findings Epidemiological, entomological and meteorological data were analyzed from 2005 to 2012 in Kaohsiung City, Taiwan. The successive waves of dengue outbreaks with different magnitudes were recorded in Kaohsiung City, and involved a dominant serotype during each epidemic. The annual indigenous dengue cases usually started from May to June and reached a peak in October to November. Vector data from 2005-2012 showed that the peak of the adult mosquito population was followed by a peak in the corresponding dengue activity with a lag period of 1-2 months. Therefore, we focused the analysis on the data from May to December and the high risk district, where the inspection of the immature and mature mosquitoes was carried out on a weekly basis and about 97.9% dengue cases occurred. The two-stage model was utilized here to estimate the risk and time-lag effect of annual dengue outbreaks in Taiwan. First, Poisson regression was used to select the optimal subset of variables and time-lags for predicting the number of dengue cases, and the final results of the multivariate analysis were selected based on the smallest AIC value. Next, each vector index models with selected variables were subjected to multiple logistic regression models to examine the accuracy of predicting the occurrence of dengue cases. The results suggested that Model-AI, BI, CI and HI predicted the occurrence of dengue cases with 83.8, 87.8, 88.3 and 88.4% accuracy, respectively. The predicting threshold based on individual Model-AI, BI, CI and HI was 0.97, 1.16, 1.79 and 0.997, respectively. Conclusion/Significance There was little evidence of quantifiable association among vector indices, meteorological factors and dengue transmission that could reliably be used for outbreak prediction. Our study here provided the proof-of-concept of how to search for the optimal model and determine the threshold for dengue epidemics. Since those factors used for prediction varied, depending on the ecology and herd immunity level under different geological areas, different thresholds may be developed for different countries using a similar structure of the twostage model.","[Chang, Fong-Shue; Chao, Day-Yu] Natl Chung Hsing Univ, Coll Vet Med, Grad Inst Microbiol & Publ Hlth, Taichung 40227, Taiwan; [Tseng, Yao-Ting; Lian, Ie-Bin] Natl Changhua Univ Educ, Grad Inst Stat & Informat Sci, Changhua, Taiwan; [Hsu, Pi-Shan] Taichung Hosp, Dept Hlth, Dept Family Med, Executive Yuan, Taiwan; [Chen, Chaur-Dong] Kaohsiung City Govt, Dept Hlth, Kaohsiung, Taiwan","Chang, FS (reprint author), Natl Chung Hsing Univ, Coll Vet Med, Grad Inst Microbiol & Publ Hlth, Taichung 40227, Taiwan.",maiblian@cc.ncue.edu.tw; dychao@nchu.edu.tw,,"Lian, Ie-bin/0000-0003-3992-6049","Ministry of Science and Technology-Taiwan [NSC101-2923-B-005-001-MY3, NSC102-2627-M-005-004]","The funding support for DYC and IBL was provided by Ministry of Science and Technology-Taiwan (NSC101-2923-B-005-001-MY3, NSC102-2627-M-005-004).

Therefore, arbovirus infections are often neglected by travel diagnostics. Here, we assessed the potential of syndrome-based approaches for diagnosis and surveillance of neglected arboviral diseases in returning travelers. Method To map the patients high at risk of missed clinical arboviral infections we compared the quantity of all arboviral diagnostic requests by physicians in the Netherlands, from 2009 through 2013, with a literature-based assessment of the travelers' likely exposure to an arbovirus. Results 2153 patients, with travel and clinical history were evaluated. The diagnostic assay for dengue virus (DENV) was the most commonly requested (86%). Of travelers returning from Southeast Asia with symptoms compatible with chikungunya virus (CHIKV), only 55% were tested. For travelers in Europe, arbovirus diagnostics were rarely requested. Over all, diagnostics for most arboviruses were requested only on severe clinical presentation. Conclusion Travel destination and syndrome were used inconsistently for triage of diagnostics, likely resulting in vast under-diagnosis of arboviral infections of public health significance. This study shows the need for more awareness among physicians and standardization of syndromic diagnostic algorithms.","[Cleton, Natalie B.; Reusken, Chantal B. E. M.; Wagenaar, Jiri F.

Herein, we analyze the changes in protein expression induced by E. caproni infection in ICR mice, a host of high compatibility in which the parasites develop chronic infections. Methodology/Principal Findings To determine the changes in protein expression, a two-dimensional DIGE approach using protein extracts from the intestine of naive and infected mice was employed; and spots showing significant differential expression were analyzed by mass spectrometry. A total of 37 spots were identified differentially expressed in infected mice (10 were found to be over-expressed and 27 down-regulated). These proteins were related to the restoration of the intestinal epithelium and the control of homeostatic dysregulation, concomitantly with mitochondrial and cytoskeletal proteins among others. Conclusion/Significance Our results suggests that changes in these processes in the ileal epithelium of ICR mice may facilitate the establishment of the parasite and the development of chronic infections. These results may serve to explain the factors determining the development of chronicity in intestinal helminth infection.","[Cortes, Alba; Sotillo, Javier; Munoz-Antoli, Carla; Guillermo Esteban, J.; Toledo, Rafael] Univ Valencia, Fac Farm, Dept Parasitol, E-46010 Valencia, Spain; [Sotillo, Javier] James Cook Univ, Ctr Biodiscovery & Mol Dev Therapeut, Australian Inst Trop Hlth & Med, Cairns, Qld, Australia; [Fried, Bernard] Lafayette Coll, Dept Biol, Easton, PA 18042 USA","Cortes, A (reprint author), Univ Valencia, Fac Farm, Dept Parasitol, E-46010 Valencia, Spain.",rafael.toledo@uv.es,"Sotillo, Javier/B-7354-2014; Toledo, Rafael/G-6741-2016","Sotillo, Javier/0000-0002-1443-7233; Toledo, Rafael/0000-0003-2651-9794",,,,101,7,7,0,4,PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE,SAN FRANCISCO,"1160 BATTERY STREET, STE 100, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94111 USA",1935-2735,,,PLOS NEGLECT TROP D,Plos Neglect.

Hepcidin, the hormone responsible for governing systemic iron homeostasis, is widely hypothesized to represent a key component of nutritional immunity through regulating the accessibility of iron to invading microorganisms during infection. However, the deployment of hepcidin in human bacterial infections remains poorly characterized. Typhoid fever is a globally significant, human-restricted bacterial infection, but understanding of its pathogenesis, especially during the critical early phases, likewise is poorly understood. Here, we investigate alterations in hepcidin and iron/inflammatory indices following experimental human typhoid challenge. Methodology/Principal Findings Fifty study participants were challenged with Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi and monitored for evidence of typhoid fever. Serum hepcidin, ferritin, serum iron parameters, C-reactive protein (CRP), and plasma IL-6 and TNF-alpha concentrations were measured during the 14 days following challenge. We found that hepcidin concentrations were markedly higher during acute typhoid infection than at baseline. Hepcidin elevations mirrored the kinetics of fever, and were accompanied by profound hypoferremia, increased CRP and ferritin, despite only modest elevations in IL-6 and TNF-alpha in some individuals. During inflammation, the extent of hepcidin upregulation associated with the degree of hypoferremia. Conclusions/Significance We demonstrate that strong hepcidin upregulation and hypoferremia, coincident with fever and systemic inflammation, are hallmarks of the early innate response to acute typhoid infection. We hypothesize that hepcidin-mediated iron redistribution into macrophages may contribute to S. Typhi pathogenesis by increasing iron availability for macrophage-tropic bacteria, and that targeting macrophage iron retention may represent a strategy for limiting infections with macrophage-tropic pathogens such as S. Typhi.","[Darton, Thomas C.; Blohmke, Christoph J.; Waddington, Claire S.; Jones, Claire; Pollard, Andrew J.] Univ Oxford, Dept Paediat, Ctr Clin Vaccinol & Trop Med, Oxford Vaccine Grp, Oxford, England; [Darton, Thomas C.; Blohmke, Christoph J.; Waddington, Claire S.; Jones, Claire; Pollard, Andrew J.] Oxford Biomed Res Ctr, Natl Inst Hlth Res, Oxford, England; [Giannoulatou, Eleni] Victor Chang Cardiac Res Inst, Darlinghurst, NSW, Australia; [Sturges, Pamela; Webster, Craig] Heart England NHS Fdn Trust, Birmingham Heartlands Hosp, Dept Biochem, Birmingham, W Midlands, England; [Drakesmith, Hal] NIHR Oxford Biomed Res Ctr, BRC Blood Theme, Oxford, England; [Drakesmith, Hal; Armitage, Andrew E.] Univ Oxford, John Radcliffe Hosp, MRC Weatherall Inst Mol Med, MRC Human Immunol Unit, Oxford OX3 9DU, England","Darton, TC (reprint author), Univ Oxford, Dept Paediat, Ctr Clin Vaccinol & Trop Med, Oxford Vaccine Grp, Oxford, England.",andrew.armitage@imm.ox.ac.uk,"Darton, Thomas/H-2816-2017; Darton, Thomas/J-3611-2013","Darton, Thomas/0000-0003-2209-9956; Darton, Thomas/0000-0003-2209-9956; Giannoulatou, Eleni/0000-0002-7084-6736; Armitage, Andrew/0000-0001-5977-6602","Wellcome Trust [092661]; NIHR Oxford Biomedical Research Centre; Jenner Institute; Oxford Martin School; Medical Research Council UK (MRC) [G0700844]; NIHR Biomedical Research Centre (Oxford University Hospitals NHS Trust, Oxford); European Union; MRC; Medical Research Council [MC_UU_12010/10, G0700844]","This work was supported by a Wellcome Trust Strategic Translational Award (grant number 092661 to AJP; www.wellcome.ac.uk); the NIHR Oxford Biomedical Research Centre (Clinical Research Fellowships to CSW and TCD; oxfordbrc.nihr.ac.uk); the Jenner Institute (www.jenner.ac.uk); the Oxford Martin School (www.oxfordmartin.ox.ac.uk); and by the Medical Research Council UK (MRC G0700844 to HD; www.mrc.ac.uk).

In this work, azidohomoalanine (AHA)-specific labeling was used to identify proteins expressed by E. granulosus protoscoleces (PSCs) upon the induction of strobilar development. Methodology/Principal Findings The in vitro incorporation of AHA with different tags into newly synthesized proteins (NSPs) by PSCs was analyzed using SDS-PAGE and confocal microscopy. The LC-MS/MS analysis of AHA-labeled NSPs by PSCs undergoing strobilation allowed for the identification of 365 proteins, of which 75 were differentially expressed in comparison between the presence or absence of strobilation stimuli and 51 were expressed exclusively in either condition. These proteins were mainly involved in metabolic, regulatory and signaling processes. Conclusions/Significance After the controlled-labeling of proteins during the induction of strobilar development, we identified modifications in protein expression. The changes in the metabolism and the activation of control and signaling pathways may be important for the correct parasite development and be target for further studies.","[Debarba, Joao Antonio; Monteiro, Karina Mariante; Ferreira, Henrique Bunselmeyer; Zaha, Arnaldo] Univ Fed Rio Grande do Sul, Ctr Biotechnol, Programa Posgrad Biol Celular & Mol, Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil; [Debarba, Joao Antonio; Monteiro, Karina Mariante; Ferreira, Henrique Bunselmeyer; Zaha, Arnaldo] Univ Fed Rio Grande do Sul, Ctr Biotechnol, Lab Biol Mol Cestodeos, Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil; [Debarba, Joao Antonio; Monteiro, Karina Mariante; Ferreira, Henrique Bunselmeyer; Zaha, Arnaldo] Univ Fed Rio Grande do Sul, Ctr Biotechnol, Lab Genom Estrutural & Func, Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil; [Monteiro, Karina Mariante; Ferreira, Henrique Bunselmeyer; Zaha, Arnaldo] Univ Fed Rio Grande do Sul, Inst Biociencias, Dept Biol Mol & Biotecnol, BR-90049 Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil; [Moura, Hercules; Barr, John R.] Ctr Dis Control & Prevent, Biol Mass Spectrometry Lab, Clin Chem Branch, Div Lab Sci,Natl Ctr Environm Hlth, Atlanta, GA USA","Debarba, JA (reprint author), Univ Fed Rio Grande do Sul, Ctr Biotechnol, Programa Posgrad Biol Celular & Mol, Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil.",zaha@cbiot.ufrgs.br,"Monteiro, Karina/D-5379-2013; Zaha, Arnaldo/D-3165-2013",,CNPq; CAPES; FAPERGS,"This work was supported by CNPq (www.cnpq.br), CAPES (www.capes.gov.br) and FAPERGS (www.fapergs.rs.gov.br) grants.

It is caused by the thermo-dimorphic fungus of the genus Paracoccidioides (Paracoccidioides brasiliensis and Paracoccidioides lutzii). Innate immune response plays a crucial role in host defense against fungal infections, and neutrophils (PMNs) are able to combat microorganisms with three different mechanisms: phagocytosis, secretion of granular proteins, which have antimicrobial properties, and the most recent described mechanism called NETosis. This new process is characterized by the release of net-like structures called Neutrophil Extracellular Traps (NETs), which is composed of nuclear (decondensed DNA and histones) and granular material such as elastase. Several microorganisms have the ability of inducing NETs formation, including gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, viruses and some fungi. We proposed to identify NETs in tegumentary lesions of patients with PCM and to analyze the interaction between two strains of P. brasiliensis and human PMNs by NETs formation in vitro. In this context, the presence of NETs in vivo was evidenced in tegumentary lesions of patients with PCM by confocal spectrum analyzer. Furthermore, we showed that the high virulent P. brasiliensis strain 18 (Pb18) and the lower virulent strain Pb265 are able to induce different patterns of NETs formation in vitro. The quantification of extracellular DNA corroborates the idea of the ability of P. brasiliensis in inducing NETs release. In conclusion, our data show for the first time the identification of NETs in lesions of patients with PCM and demonstrate distinct patterns of NETs in cultures challenged with fungi in vitro. The presence of NETs components both in vivo and in vitro open new possibilities for the detailed investigation of immunity in PCM.","[Della Coletta, Amanda Manoel; de Quaglia e Silva, Juliana Carvalho; De Faveri, Julio; Alencar Marques, Mariangela Esther; Dias-Melicio, Luciane Alarcao] UNESP Sao Paulo State Univ, Dept Pathol, Botucatu Med Sch, Botucatu, SP, Brazil; [Bachiega, Tatiana Fernanda; Victoriano de Campos Soares, Angela Maria] UNESP Sao Paulo State Univ, Dept Microbiol & Immunol, Biosci Inst, Botucatu, SP, Brazil; [Marques, Silvio Alencar] UNESP Sao Paulo State Univ, Dept Dermatol & Radiotherapy, Botucatu Med Sch, Botucatu, SP, Brazil; [Ximenes, Valdecir Farias] UNESP Sao Paulo State Univ, Sch Sci, Dept Chem, Bauru, SP, Brazil","Della Coletta, AM (reprint author), UNESP Sao Paulo State Univ, Dept Pathol, Botucatu Med Sch, Botucatu, SP, Brazil.",ladiasmelicio@fmb.unesp.br,"Ximenes, Valdecir/A-5323-2008; Dias-Melicio, Luciane A/I-5788-2014","Ximenes, Valdecir/0000-0003-2636-3080; Dias-Melicio, Luciane A/0000-0001-9254-2074; Alencar Marques, Mariangela Esther/0000-0001-6947-5627",Sao Paulo Research Foundation (FAPESP) [2011/18855-7]; CNPq [480486/2011-5]; Fundunesp [00637/11-DFP]; FAPESP MS fellowship [AMDC-FAPESP 2013/00788-7],"This work was suported by Sao Paulo Research Foundation (FAPESP 2011/18855-7), CNPq 480486/2011-5 and Fundunesp 00637/11-DFP; FAPESP MS fellowship (AMDC-FAPESP 2013/00788-7).

Chronic STH infection impairs optimum learning and productivity, contributing to the perpetuation of the poverty-disease cycle. Regular massive drug administration (MDA) is the cardinal recommendation for its control; along with water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) interventions. The impact of joint WASH interventions on STH infections has been reported; studies on the independent effect of WASH components are needed to contribute with the improvement of current recommendations for the control of STH. The aim of this study is to assess the association of lacking access to water and sanitation with STH infections, taking into account the differences in route of infection among species and the availability of adequate water and sanitation at home. Methods and Findings Cross-sectional study, conducted in Salta province, Argentina. During a deworming program that enrolled 6957 individuals; 771 were randomly selected for stool/serum sampling for parasitological and serological diagnosis of STH. Bivariate stratified analysis was performed to explore significant correlations between risk factors and STH infections grouped by mechanism of entry as skin-penetrators (hookworms and Strongyloides stercoralis) vs. orally-ingested (Ascaris lumbricoides and Trichuris trichiura). After controlling for potential confounders, unimproved sanitation was significantly associated with increased odds of infection of skin-penetrators (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 3.9; 95% CI: 2.6-5.9). Unimproved drinking water was significantly associated with increased odds of infection of orally-ingested (aOR = 2.2; 95% CI: 1.3-3.7). Conclusions Lack of safe water and proper sanitation pose a risk of STH infections that is distinct according to the route of entry to the human host used by each of the STH species. Interventions aimed to improve water and sanitation access should be highlighted in the recommendations for the control of STH.","[Echazu, Adriana; Juarez, Marisa; Cajal, Silvana P.; Cimino, Ruben O.; Caro, Nicolas; Vargas, Paola A.; Krolewiecki, Alejandro J.] Univ Nacl Salta Sede Reg Oran, Inst Invest Enfermedades Trop, San Ramon De La Nueva Oa, Salta, Argentina; [Echazu, Adriana; Krolewiecki, Alejandro J.] Consejo Nacl Invest Cient & Tecn, RA-1033 Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [Bonanno, Daniela] Minist Salud Nacion, Direcc Nacl Prevenc Enfermedades & Riesgos, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [Juarez, Marisa] Fdn Mundo Sano, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [Heredia, Viviana; Caropresi, Silvia; Paredes, Gladys] Hosp Juan Domingo Peron, Tartagal, Salta, Argentina","Echazu, A (reprint author), Univ Nacl Salta Sede Reg Oran, Inst Invest Enfermedades Trop, San Ramon De La Nueva Oa, Salta, Argentina.",adrianaechazu@hotmail.com,,,,,,40,25,27,0,5,PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE,SAN FRANCISCO,"1160 BATTERY STREET, STE 100, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94111 USA",1935-2735,,,PLOS NEGLECT TROP D,Plos Neglect.

This systematic literature review is to the knowledge of the authors the first that aims to assess the community-effectiveness of temephos in controlling both vectors and dengue transmission when delivered either as a single intervention or in combination with other interventions. A comprehensive literature search of 6 databases was performed (PubMed, WHOLIS, GIFT, CDSR, EMBASE, Wiley), grey literature and cross references were also screened for relevant studies. Data were extracted and methodological quality of the studies was assessed independently by two reviewers. 27 studies were included in this systematic review (11 single intervention studies and 16 combined intervention studies). All 11 single intervention studies showed consistently that using temephos led to a reduction in entomological indices. Although 11 of the 16 combined intervention studies showed that temephos application together with other chemical vector control methods also reduced entomological indices, this was either not sustained over time or-as in the five remaining studies-failed to reduce the immature stages. The community-effectiveness of temephos was found to be dependent on factors such as quality of delivery, water turnover rate, type of water, and environmental factors such as organic debris, temperature and exposure to sunlight. Timing of temephos deployment and its need for reapplication, along with behavioural factors such as the reluctance of its application to drinking water, and operational aspects such as cost, supplies, time and labour were further limitations identified in this review. In conclusion, when applied as a single intervention, temephos was found to be effective at suppressing entomological indices, however, the same effect has not been observed when temephos was applied in combination with other interventions. There is no evidence to suggest that temephos use is associated with reductions in dengue transmission.","[George, Leyanna] Amrita Inst Med Sci, Dept Community Med, Kochi, Kerala, India; [Lenhart, Audrey] US Ctr Dis Control & Prevent CDC, Atlanta, GA USA; [Toledo, Joao] Minist Hlth, Brasilia, DF, Brazil; [Han, Wai Wai] Minist Hlth, Yangon, Myanmar; [Velayudhan, Raman] WHO, Dept Control Neglected Trop Dis, CH-1211 Geneva, Switzerland; [Ranzinger, Silvia Runge] WHO, Special Programme Res & Training Trop Dis, CH-1211 Geneva, Switzerland; [Horstick, Olaf] Heidelberg Univ, Inst Publ Hlth, Heidelberg, Germany","George, L (reprint author), Amrita Inst Med Sci, Dept Community Med, Kochi, Kerala, India.",Olaf.Horstick@uni-heidelberg.de,,,Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft; Ruprecht-Karls-Universitat Heidelberg,"We acknowledge the financial support of the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft and Ruprecht-Karls-Universitat Heidelberg within the funding programme Open Access Publishing.

Here, we describe an outbreak of lymphocutaneous sporotrichosis that was investigated in a South African gold mine in 2011. Methodology Employees working at a reopened section of the mine were recruited for a descriptive cross-sectional study. Informed consent was sought for interview, clinical examination and medical record review. Specimens were collected from participants with active or partially-healed lymphocutaneous lesions. Environmental samples were collected from underground mine levels. Sporothrix isolates were identified by sequencing of the internal transcribed spacer region of the ribosomal gene and the nuclear calmodulin gene. Principal Findings Of 87 male miners, 81 (93%) were interviewed and examined, of whom 29 (36%) had skin lesions; specimens were collected from 17 (59%). Sporotrichosis was laboratory-confirmed among 10 patients and seven had clinically-compatible lesions. Of 42 miners with known HIV status, 11 (26%) were HIV-infected. No cases of disseminated disease were detected. Participants with <= 3 years' mining experience had a four times greater odds of developing sporotrichosis than those who had been employed for > 3 years (adjusted OR 4.0, 95% CI 1.2-13.1). Isolates from 8 patients were identified as Sporothrix schenckii sensu stricto by calmodulin gene sequencing while environmental isolates were identified as Sporothrix mexicana. Conclusions/Significance S. schenckii sensu stricto was identified as the causative pathogen. Although genetically distinct species were isolated from clinical and environmental sources, it is likely that the source was contaminated soil and untreated wood underground. No cases occurred following recommendations to close sections of the mine, treat timber and encourage consistent use of personal protective equipment. Sporotrichosis is a potentially re-emerging disease where traditional, rather than heavily mechanised, mining techniques are used. Surveillance should be instituted at sentinel locations.","[Govender, Nelesh P.; Maphanga, Tsidiso G.; Zulu, Thokozile G.; Patel, Jaymati; Walaza, Sibongile; Jacobs, Charlene; Ebonwu, Joy I.; Ntuli, Sindile; Naicker, Serisha D.; Thomas, Juno] Natl Inst Communicable Dis, Johannesburg, South Africa; [Govender, Nelesh P.; Walaza, Sibongile; Thomas, Juno] Univ Witwatersrand, Johannesburg, South Africa; [Ebonwu, Joy I.] Univ Pretoria, ZA-0002 Pretoria, South Africa","Govender, NP (reprint author), Natl Inst Communicable Dis, Johannesburg, South Africa.",neleshg@nicd.ac.za,,,Pfizer; MSD (Pty) Ltd,"Outside the submitted work, NPG has received an investigator-initiated research grant and speaker honoraria from Pfizer, speaker honoraria and travel funding from MSD (Pty) Ltd, has provided educational materials for TerraNova and has acted as a temporary consultant for Fujifilm Pharmaceuticals.

Compared to other Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTD), the public health burden of SBE has not been well characterized. We estimated the impact of snakebite mortality and morbidity using the Disability Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) metrics for 16 countries in WA. Methods We used the reported annual number of SB deaths and mean age at time of SB and converted these into years of life lost (YLL). Similarly, the years of life lived with disability (YLD) were estimated by multiplying the number of amputations by the respective disability weight of 0.13. Results In WA, the annual cases of SB mortality and amputations ranged from 24 (95% Confidence Interval: 19-29) and 28 (17-48) respectively in Guinea-Bissau with the highest estimates of 1927 (1529-2333) and 2368 (1506-4043) respectively in Nigeria. We calculated that the annual DALYs associated with a SB death ranged from 1550 DALYs (95% CI: 1227-1873 DALYs) in Guinea Bissau to 124,484 DALYs (95% CI: 98,773-150,712 DALYs) in Nigeria. The annual DALYs associated with amputation for the two countries were 149 DALYs (95% CI: 91-256 DALYs) and 12,621 DALYs (95% CI: 8027-21,549 DALYs) respectively. The total burden of SBE was estimated at 319,874 DALYs (95% CI: 248,357-402,654 DALYs) in the 16 countries in WA. These estimates are similar, and in some instances even higher, than for other NTDs encountered in WA (e.g., Buruli ulcer, Echinococcosis, Intestinal Nematode Infections, Leishmaniasis, Onchocerchiasis, Trachoma and Trypanosomiasis) as reported in the Global Burden of Diseases 2010 (GBD). Conclusions The public health burden of SBE in WA is very substantial and similar to other more widely recognized NTDs. Efforts and funding commensurate with its burden should be made available for the control of snakebite in the sub-region.","[Habib, Abdulrazaq G.; Kuznik, Andreas; Hamza, Muhammad; Abdullahi, Maryam I.; Chedi, Basheer A.] Bayero Univ, Coll Hlth Sci, Kano, Nigeria; [Kuznik, Andreas] Celgene Corp, Warren, NJ USA; [Chippaux, Jean-Philippe] Inst Rech Dev, Cotonou, Benin; [Chippaux, Jean-Philippe] Univ Paris 05, Sorbonne Paris Cite, Fac Pharm, Paris, France; [Warrell, David A.] Univ Oxford, Nuffield Dept Med, Oxford, England","Habib, AG (reprint author), Bayero Univ, Coll Hlth Sci, Kano, Nigeria.",abdulrazaq_habib@yahoo.co.uk,,"Chippaux, Jean-Philippe/0000-0002-1976-8568",,,,27,21,21,0,2,PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE,SAN FRANCISCO,"1160 BATTERY STREET, STE 100, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94111 USA",1935-2735,,,PLOS NEGLECT TROP D,Plos Neglect.

Relatively little is understood about the mode of transmission, pathogenesis, or host immune responses to MU infection. Due to significant reduction in quality of life for patients with extensive tissue scarring, and that a disproportionately high percentage of those affected are disadvantaged children, a Buruli ulcer vaccine would be greatly beneficial to the worldwide community. Previous studies have shown that mice inoculated with either M. bovis bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG) or a DNA vaccine encoding the M. ulcerans mycolyl transferase, Ag85A (MU-Ag85A), are transiently protected against pathology caused by intradermal challenge with MU. Building upon this principle, we have generated quality-controlled, live-recombinant strains of BCG and M. smegmatis which express the immunodominant MU Ag85A. Priming with rBCG MUAg85A followed by an M. smegmatis MU-Ag85A boost strongly induced murine antigenspecific CD4(+) T cells and elicited functional IFN.-producing splenocytes which recognized MU-Ag85A peptide and whole M. ulcerans better than a BCG prime-boost vaccination. Strikingly, mice vaccinated with a single subcutaneous dose of BCG MU-Ag85A or prime-boost displayed significantly enhanced survival, reduced tissue pathology, and lower bacterial load compared to mice vaccinated with BCG. Importantly, this level of superior protection against experimental Buruli ulcer compared to BCG has not previously been achieved. These results suggest that use of BCG as a recombinant vehicle expressing MU antigens represents an effective Buruli ulcer vaccine strategy and warrants further antigen discovery to improve vaccine efficacy.","[Hart, Bryan E.; Hale, Laura P.; Lee, Sunhee] Duke Univ, Med Ctr, Human Vaccine Inst, Durham, NC 27708 USA; [Hart, Bryan E.; Hale, Laura P.; Lee, Sunhee] Duke Univ, Med Ctr, Dept Med, Durham, NC 27710 USA; [Hale, Laura P.] Duke Univ, Dept Pathol, Durham, NC 27706 USA","Hart, BE (reprint author), Duke Univ, Med Ctr, Human Vaccine Inst, Durham, NC 27708 USA.",sunhee.lee@duke.edu,,"Hart, Bryan/0000-0001-5109-6151",Duke Human Vaccine Institute,"Funding was provided by the Duke Human Vaccine Institute (http://dhvi.duke.edu/).

Although whipworms in human and non-human primates historically have been referred to as T. trichiura, recent reports suggest that several Trichuris spp. are found in primates. Methods and Findings We sequenced and annotated complete mitochondrial genomes of Trichuris recovered from a human in Uganda, an olive baboon in the US, a hamadryas baboon in Denmark, and two pigs from Denmark and Uganda. Comparative analyses using other published mitochondrial genomes of Trichuris recovered from a human and a porcine host in China and from a francois' leaf-monkey (China) were performed, including phylogenetic analyses and pairwise genetic and amino acid distances. Genetic and protein distances between human Trichuris in Uganda and China were high (similar to 19% and 15%, respectively) suggesting that they represented different species. Trichuris from the olive baboon in US was genetically related to human Trichuris in China, while the other from the hamadryas baboon in Denmark was nearly identical to human Trichuris from Uganda. Baboon-derived Trichuris was genetically distinct from Trichuris from franois' leaf monkey, suggesting multiple whipworm species circulating among non-human primates. The genetic and protein distances between pig Trichuris from Denmark and other regions were roughly 9% and 6%, respectively, while Chinese and Ugandan whipworms were more closely related. Conclusion and Significance Our results indicate that Trichuris species infecting humans and pigs are phylogenetically distinct across geographical regions, which might have important implications for the implementation of suitable and effective control strategies in different regions. Moreover, we provide support for the hypothesis that Trichuris infecting primates represents a complex of cryptic species with some species being able to infect both humans and non-human primates.","[Hawash, Mohamed B.

Symptoms include severe itching, skin lesions, and vision impairment including blindness. More than 99% of all cases are concentrated in sub-Saharan Africa. Fortunately, vector control and community-directed treatment with ivermectin have significantly decreased morbidity, and the treatment goal is shifting from control to elimination in Africa. Methods We estimated financial resources and societal opportunity costs associated with scaling up community-directed treatment with ivermectin and implementing surveillance and response systems in endemic African regions for alternative treatment goals-control, elimination, and eradication. We used a micro-costing approach that allows adjustment for time-variant resource utilization and for the heterogeneity in the demographic, epidemiological, and political situation. Results The elimination and eradication scenarios, which include scaling up treatments to hypoendemic and operationally challenging areas at the latest by 2021 and implementing intensive surveillance, would allow savings of $1.5 billion and $1.6 billion over 2013-2045 as compared to the control scenario. Although the elimination and eradication scenarios would require higher surveillance costs ($215 million and $242 million) than the control scenario ($47 million), intensive surveillance would enable treatments to be safely stopped earlier, thereby saving unnecessary costs for prolonged treatments as in the control scenario lacking such surveillance and response systems. Conclusions The elimination and eradication of onchocerciasis are predicted to allow substantial cost-savings in the long run. To realize cost-savings, policymakers should keep empowering community volunteers, and pharmaceutical companies would need to continue drug donation. To sustain high surveillance costs required for elimination and eradication, endemic countries would need to enhance their domestic funding capacity. Societal and political will would be critical to sustaining all of these efforts in the long term.","[Kim, Young Eun; Tediosi, Fabrizio] Swiss Trop & Publ Hlth Inst, Basel, Switzerland; [Kim, Young Eun; Tediosi, Fabrizio] Univ Basel, Basel, Switzerland; [Sicuri, Elisa] Univ Barcelona, Hosp Clin Barcelona, ISGlobal, Barcelona Ctr Int Hlth Res CRESIB, Barcelona, Spain","Kim, YE (reprint author), Swiss Trop & Publ Hlth Inst, Basel, Switzerland.",young.kim@unibas.ch,"Tediosi, Fabrizio/L-1505-2015; Sicuri, Elisa/L-8012-2014","Tediosi, Fabrizio/0000-0001-8671-9400; Sicuri, Elisa/0000-0002-2499-2732",Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation (BMGF) [OPP1037660],"This study was funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation (BMGF;www.gatesfoundation.org, grant number: OPP1037660).

Ivermectin is a broad-spectrum anti-parasitic agent that also has an impact on other co-endemic parasitic infections. In this study, we roughly assessed the additional impact of APOC activities on the burden of the most important off-target infections: soil-transmitted helminthiases (STH; ascariasis, trichuriasis, hookworm, and strongyloidiasis), lymphatic filariasis (LF), and scabies. Based on a literature review, we formulated assumptions about the impact of ivermectin treatment on the disease burden of these off-target infections. Using data on the number of ivermectin treatments in APOC regions and the latest estimates of the burden of disease, we then calculated the impact of APOC activities on off-target infections in terms of disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) averted. We conservatively estimated that between 1995 and 2010, annual ivermectin mass treatment has cumulatively averted about 500 thousand DALYs from co-endemic STH infections, LF, and scabies. This impact comprised approximately an additional 5.5% relative to the total burden averted from onchocerciasis (8.9 million DALYs) and indicates that the overall cost-effectiveness of APOC is even higher than previously reported.","[Krotneva, Stanimira P.; Coffeng, Luc E.; de Vlas, Sake J.; Stolk, Wilma A.] Erasmus MC, Univ Med Ctr Rotterdam, Dept Publ Hlth, Rotterdam, Netherlands; [Noma, Mounkaila; Zoure, Honorat G.

Previous work has shown that the small molecule clotrimazole inhibits intestinal Cl-secretion by blocking both cyclic nucleotide- and Ca2+-gated K+ channels, implicating its use in the treatment of diarrhea of diverse etiologies. Clotrimazole, however, might also inhibit transporters that mediate the inwardly directed electrochemical potential for Na+-dependent solute absorption, which would undermine its clinical application. Here we test this possibility by examining the effects of clotrimazole on Na+-coupled glucose uptake. Materials and Methods Short-circuit currents (Isc) following administration of glucose and secretagogues were studied in clotrimazole-treated jejunal sections of mouse intestine mounted in Ussing chambers. Results Treatment of small intestinal tissue with clotrimazole inhibited the Cl-secretory currents that resulted from challenge with the cAMP-agonist vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) or Ca2+-agonist carbachol in a dose-dependent fashion. A dose of 30 mu M was effective in significantly reducing the Isc response to VIP and carbachol by 50% and 72%, respectively. At this dose, uptake of glucose was only marginally affected (decreased by 14%, p = 0.37). There was no measurable effect on SGLT1-mediated sugar transport, as uptake of SGLT1-restricted 3-O-methyl glucose was equivalent between clotrimazole-treated and untreated tissue (98% vs. 100%, p = 0.90). Conclusion Treatment of intestinal tissue with clotrimazole significantly reduced secretory responses caused by both cAMP-and Ca2+-dependent agonists as expected, but did not affect Na+-coupled glucose absorption. Clotrimazole could thus be used in conjunction with oral rehydration solution as a low-cost, auxiliary treatment of acute secretory diarrheas.","[Lexmond, Willem S.; Rufo, Paul A.; Fiebiger, Edda; Lencer, Wayne I.] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Boston Childrens Hosp, Div Gastroenterol & Nutr, Boston, MA 02115 USA","Lexmond, WS (reprint author), Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Boston Childrens Hosp, Div Gastroenterol & Nutr, Boston, MA 02115 USA.",wayne.lencer@childrens.harvard.edu,,"Lencer, Wayne/0000-0001-7346-2730","NIH [R21 DK090603, RO1 DK48106, DK084424, R01AI075037]; Harvard Digestive Diseases Center [DK034854]; Ter Meulen Fund of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences","This work was funded by NIH grants R21 DK090603 and RO1 DK48106 and DK084424 (to WIL) and R01AI075037 (to EF) and the Harvard Digestive Diseases Center DK034854 (http://www.nih.gov).

Laboratory testing confirmed recent DENV infection and the case demonstrated a clinically compatible illness. The infection was most likely acquired in the Pilbara region in the northwest of WA. Follow up investigations did not detect any other locally-acquired dengue cases or any known dengue vector species in the local region, despite intensive adult and larval mosquito surveillance, both immediately after the case was notified in October 2013 and after the start of the wet season in January 2014. The mechanism of infection with DENV in this case cannot be confirmed. However, it most likely followed a bite from a single infected mosquito vector that was transiently introduced into the Pilbara region but failed to establish a local breeding population. This case highlights the public health importance of maintaining surveillance efforts to ensure that any incursions of dengue vectors into WA are promptly identified and do not become established, particularly given the large numbers of viraemic dengue fever cases imported into WA by travellers returning from dengue-endemic regions.","[Lindsay, Michael D.

Methodology/Principal Findings A single-tube multiplex PCR assay was established to differentiate the Echinococcus species responsible for infections in intermediate and definitive hosts. Primers specific for E. granulosus, E. multilocularis and E. shiquicus were designed based on sequences of the mitochondrial NADH dehydrogenase subunit 1 (nad1), NADH dehydrogenase subunit 5 (nad5) and cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 (cox1) genes, respectively. This multiplex PCR accurately detected Echinococcus DNA without generating nonspecific reaction products. PCR products were of the expected sizes of 219 (nad1), 584 (nad5) and 471 (cox1) bp. Furthermore, the multiplex PCR enabled diagnosis of multiple infections using DNA of protoscoleces and copro-DNA extracted from fecal samples of canine hosts. Specificity of the multiplex PCR was 100% when evaluated using DNA isolated from other cestodes. Sensitivity thresholds were determined for DNA from protoscoleces and from worm eggs, and were calculated as 20 pg of DNA for E. granulosus and E. shiquicus, 10 pg of DNA for E. multilocularis, 2 eggs for E. granulosus, and 1 egg for E. multilocularis. Positive results with copro-DNA could be obtained at day 17 and day 26 after experimental infection of dogs with larval E. multilocularis and E. granulosus, respectively. Conclusions/Significance The multiplex PCR developed in this study is an efficient tool for discriminating E. granulosus, E. multilocularis and E. shiquicus from each other and from other taeniid cestodes. It can be used for the detection of canids infected with E. granulosus s.s. and E. multilocularis using feces collected from these definitive hosts. It can also be used for the identification of the Echinococcus metacestode larva in intermediate hosts, a stage that often cannot be identified to species on visual inspection.","[Liu, Cong-Nuan; Lou, Zhong-Zi; Li, Li; Yan, Hong-Bin; Fan, Yan-Lei; Li, Jian-Qiu; Fu, Bao-Quan; Jia, Wan-Zhong] CAAS, Lanzhou Vet Res Inst, Key Lab Zoonoses,Agr Minist, State Key Lab Vet Etiol Biol,Key Lab Vet Parasito, Lanzhou, Peoples R China; [Blair, David] James Cook Univ, Sch Marine & Trop Biol, Townsville, Qld, Australia; [Lei, Meng-Tong; Cai, Jin-Zhong] Qinghai Acad Anim Sci & Vet Med, Xining, Peoples R China; [Yang, Yu-Rong; McManus, Donald P.] QIMR Berghofer Med Res Inst, Div Infect Dis, Mol Parasitol Lab, Brisbane, Qld, Australia; [Yang, Yu-Rong] Ningxia Med Univ, Yinchuan, Ningxia Hui Aut, Peoples R China","Liu, CN (reprint author), CAAS, Lanzhou Vet Res Inst, Key Lab Zoonoses,Agr Minist, State Key Lab Vet Etiol Biol,Key Lab Vet Parasito, Lanzhou, Peoples R China.",yangyurong@hotmail.com; don.mcmanus@qimrberghofer.edu.au; jiawanzhong@caas.cn,"Blair, David/O-2786-2019","Blair, David/0000-0002-4658-3251","Gansu Provincial Key Science and Technology Projects [1203NKDA039]; Special Fund for Agro-scientific Research in the Public Interest [201303037, 200903036-07]; Science Fund for Creative Research Groups of Gansu Province [1210RJIA006]; Natural Science Foundation of China [30960339]; National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) Project [APP-1009539]","This study was supported by the following: WZJ: Gansu Provincial Key Science and Technology Projects (Grant No. 1203NKDA039, http://www.gsstc.gov.cn/), ZZL: the Special Fund for Agro-scientific Research in the Public Interest (Grant No. 201303037, http://www.moa.gov.cn), WZJ: the Special Fund for Agro-scientific Research in the Public Interest (Grant No. 200903036-07, http://www.moa.gov.cn), WZJ: the Science Fund for Creative Research Groups of Gansu Province (Grant No. 1210RJIA006, http://www.gsstc.gov.cn/), YRY: Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 30960339, http://www.nsfc.gov.cn/), YRY: National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) Project (Grant No. APP-1009539, http://www.nhmrc.gov.au/).

Methodology/Principal Findings Data on STH infection from 35,573 individuals across the country were geolocated at the barangay level and included in the analysis. The analysis was stratified geographically in two major regions: 1) Luzon and the Visayas and 2) Mindanao. Bayesian geostatistical models of STH prevalence were developed, including age and sex of individuals and environmental variables (rainfall, land surface temperature and distance to inland water bodies) as predictors, and diagnostic uncertainty was incorporated. The role of environmental variables was different between regions of the Philippines. This analysis revealed that while A. lumbricoides and T. trichiura infections were widespread and highly endemic, hookworm infections were more circumscribed to smaller foci in the Visayas and Mindanao. Conclusions/Significance This analysis revealed significant spatial variation in STH infection prevalence within provinces of the Philippines. This suggests that a spatially targeted approach to STH interventions, including mass drug administration, is warranted. When financially possible, additional STH surveys should be prioritized to high-risk areas identified by our study in Luzon.","[Magalhaes, Ricardo J.

Sand fly saliva is composed of a large variety of components that exert different pharmacological activities facilitating the acquisition of blood by the insect. Importantly, proteins present in saliva are able to elicit the production of specific anti-saliva antibodies, which can be used as markers for exposure to vector bites. Serological tests using total sand fly salivary gland extracts are challenging due to the difficulty of obtaining reproducible salivary gland preparations. Previously, we demonstrated that PpSP32 is the immunodominant salivary antigen in humans exposed to Phlebotomus papatasi bites and established that humans exposed to P. perniciosus bites do not recognize it. Methodology/Principal Findings Herein, we have validated, in a large cohort of 522 individuals, the use of the Phlebotomus papatasi recombinant salivary protein PpSP32 (rPpSP32) as an alternative method for testing exposure to the bite of this sand fly. We also demonstrated that screening for total anti-rPpSP32 IgG antibodies is sufficient, being comparable in efficacy to the screening for IgG2, IgG4 and IgE antibodies against rPpSP32. Additionally, sera obtained from dogs immunized with saliva of P. perniciosus, a sympatric and widely distributed sand fly in Tunisia, did not recognize rPpSP32 demonstrating its suitability as a marker of exposure to P. papatasi saliva. Conclusions/Significance Our data indicate that rPpSP32 constitutes a useful epidemiological tool to monitor the spatial distribution of P. papatasi in a particular region, to direct control measures against zoonotic cutaneous leishmaniasis, to assess the efficiency of vector control interventions and perhaps to assess the risk of contracting the disease.","[Marzouki, Soumaya; Bettaieb, Jihene; Kacem, Saoussen Hadj; Abdelkader, Rania; Ben Salah, Afif; Louzir, Hechmi; Ben Ahmed, Melika] Inst Pasteur Tunis, Lab Transmiss Control & Immunobiol Infect, Tunis, Tunisia; [Kammoun-Rebai, Wafa] Inst Pasteur Tunis, Lab Med Parasitol Biotechnol & Biomol, Tunis, Tunisia; [Bettaieb, Jihene; Ben Salah, Afif; Louzir, Hechmi; Ben Ahmed, Melika] Univ Tunis El Manar, Fac Med Tunis, Tunis, Tunisia; [Abdeladhim, Maha; Aslan, Hamide; Kamhawi, Shaden] NIAID, Vector Mol Biol Sect, Lab Malaria & Vector Res, NIH, Rockville, MD USA; [Gritli, Sami] Charles Nicolle Hosp, Dept Pathol, Tunis, Tunisia; [Chemkhi, Jomaa] Inst Pasteur Tunis, Lab Mol Epidemiol & Expt Pathol, Tunis, Tunisia","Marzouki, S (reprint author), Inst Pasteur Tunis, Lab Transmiss Control & Immunobiol Infect, LR11IPT02, Tunis, Tunisia.",melika.benahmed@pasteur.rns.tn,,,"NIH/NIAID [SP50AI074178]; Intramural Research Program of the NIH, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases","The project was supported by the NIH/NIAID Grant Number SP50AI074178 and in part by the Intramural Research Program of the NIH, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (MA, HA, SK, JGV).

In chronic cases of intestinal schistosomiasis caused by trematodes of the Schistosoma genus, hepatic fibrosis develops as a host immune response to the helminth eggs, followed by potentially lethal portal hypertension. In this study, we characterized hepatic and splenic features of a murine model of intestinal schistosomiasis using in vivo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and evaluated the transverse relaxation time T-2 as a non-invasive imaging biomarker for monitoring hepatic fibrogenesis. Methodology/Principal Findings CBA/J mice were imaged at 11.75T two, six and ten weeks after percutaneous infection with Schistosoma mansoni. In vivo imaging studies were completed with histology at the last two time points. Anatomical MRI allowed detection of typical manifestations of the intestinal disease such as significant hepato-and splenomegaly, and dilation of the portal vein as early as six weeks, with further aggravation at 10 weeks after infection. Liver multifocal lesions observed by MRI in infected animals at 10 weeks post infection corresponded to granulomatous inflammation and intergranulomatous fibrosis with METAVIR scores up to A2F2. While most healthy hepatic tissue showed T-2 values below 14 ms, these lesions were characterized by a T-2 greater than 16 ms. The area fraction of increased T-2 correlated (r(S) = 0.83) with the area fraction of Sirius Red stained collagen in histological sections. A continuous liver T-2* decrease was also measured while brown pigments in macrophages were detected at histology. These findings suggest accumulation of hematin in infected livers. Conclusions/Significance Our multiparametric MRI approach confirms that this murine model replicates hepatic and splenic manifestations of human intestinal schistosomiasis.

Animal models that show similarities to the human form of CL after infection with Leishmania should be more representative as to the effect of the parasite within a human. Thus, these models are used to evaluate the efficacy of new anti-leishmanial compounds before human clinical trials. Current animal models aim to investigate (i) host-parasite interactions, (ii) pathogenesis, (iii) biochemical changes/pathways, (iv) in vivo maintenance of parasites, and (v) clinical evaluation of drug candidates. This review focuses on the trends of infection observed between Leishmania parasites, the predictability of different strains, and the determination of parasite load. These factors were used to investigate the overall effectiveness of the current animal models. The main aim was to assess the efficacy and limitations of the various CL models and their potential for drug discovery and evaluation. In conclusion, we found that the following models are the most suitable for the assessment of anti-leishmanial drugs: L. major-C57BL/6 mice (or-vervet monkey, or-rhesus monkeys), L. tropica-CsS-16 mice, L. amazonensis-CBA mice, L. braziliensis-golden hamster (or-rhesus monkey).

Plasmodium falciparum malaria is an important risk factor for invasive NTS bloodstream in African children. Here we investigated whether a live, attenuated Salmonella vaccine could be protective in mice, in the setting of concurrent malaria. Surprisingly, mice acutely infected with the nonlethal malaria parasite Plasmodium yoelii 17XNL exhibited a profound loss of protective immunity to NTS, but vaccine-mediated protection was restored after resolution of malaria. Absence of protective immunity during acute malaria correlated with maintenance of antibodies to NTS, but a marked reduction in effector capability of Salmonella-specific CD4 and CD8 T cells. Further, increased expression of the inhibitory molecule PD1 was identified on memory CD4 T cells induced by vaccination. Blockade of IL-10 restored protection against S. Typhimurium, without restoring CD4 T cell effector function. Simultaneous blockade of CTLA-4, LAG3, and PDL1 restored IFN-. production by vaccine-induced memory CD4 T cells but was not sufficient to restore protection. Together, these data demonstrate that malaria parasite infection induces a temporary loss of an established adaptive immune response via multiple mechanisms, and suggest that in the setting of acute malaria, protection against NTS mediated by live vaccines may be interrupted.","[Mooney, Jason P.; Lokken, Kristen L.; Nuccio, Sean-Paul; Tsolis, Renee M.] Univ Calif Davis, Sch Med, Dept Microbiol & Immunol, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Lee, Seung-Joo; Nanton, Minelva R.; McSorley, Stephen J.] Univ Calif Davis, Sch Vet Med, Dept Anat Physiol & Cell Biol, Ctr Comparat Med, Davis, CA 95616 USA","Mooney, JP (reprint author), Univ Calif Davis, Sch Med, Dept Microbiol & Immunol, Davis, CA 95616 USA.",rmtsolis@ucdavis.edu,"Mooney, Jason Paul/K-1129-2019","Mooney, Jason Paul/0000-0002-2824-124X; McSorley, Stephen/0000-0002-6363-3222; Tsolis, Renee/0000-0001-9131-6657; Nuccio, Sean-Paul/0000-0002-9683-9278",US Public Health Service; American Heart Association,"This work was funded by US Public Health Service http://www.usphs.gov/(RMT,SJM); and American Heart Association http://www.heart.org (KLL).

Filariae are nematodes with complex anatomy including fully developed digestive tracts and reproductive organs. To better understand the basic biology of filarial parasites and to provide insights into drug targets and vaccine design, we conducted a proteomic analysis of different anatomic fractions of Brugia malayi, a causative agent of LF. Approximately 500 adult female B. malayi worms were dissected, and three anatomical fractions (body wall, digestive tract, and reproductive tract) were obtained. Proteins from each anatomical fraction were extracted, desalted, trypsinized, and analyzed by microcapillary reverse-phase liquid chromatography-tandem-mass spectrometry. In total, we identified 4,785 B. malayi proteins. While 1,894 were identified in all three anatomic fractions, 396 were positively identified only within the digestive tract, 114 only within the body wall, and 1,011 only within the reproductive tract. Gene set enrichment analysis revealed a bias for transporters to be present within the digestive tract, suggesting that the intestine of adult filariae is functional and important for nutrient uptake or waste removal. As expected, the body wall exhibited increased frequencies of cytoskeletal proteins, and the reproductive tract had increased frequencies of proteins involved in nuclear regulation and transcription. In assessing for possible vaccine candidates, we focused on proteins sequestered within the digestive tract, as these could possibly represent ""hidden antigens"" with low risk of prior allergic sensitization. We identified 106 proteins that are enriched in the digestive tract and are predicted to localize to the surface of cells in the the digestive tract. It is possible that some of these proteins are on the luminal surface and may be accessible by antibodies ingested by the worm. A subset of 27 of these proteins appear especially promising vaccine candidates as they contain significant non-cytoplasmic domains, only 1-2 transmembrane domains, and a high degree of homology to W. bancrofti and/ or O. volvulus.","[Morris, C.

It still presents as an important public health problem in many countries in the tropics. In Cameroon, where many NTDs are endemic, only scant data describing the situation regarding LF epidemiology was available. The aim of this study was to describe the current situation regarding LF infection in Cameroon, and to map this infection and accurately delineate areas where mass drug administration (MDA) was required. Methodology The endemicity status and distribution of LF was assessed in eight of the ten Regions of Cameroon by a rapid-format card test for detection ofW. bancrofti antigen (immunochromatographic test, ICT). The baseline data required to monitor the effectiveness of MDA was collected by assessing microfilariaemia in nocturnal calibrated thick blood smears in sentinel sites selected in the health districts where ICT positivity rate was >= 1%. Principal findings Among the 120 health districts visited in the eight Regions during ICT survey, 106 (88.3%) were found to be endemic for LF (i.e. had ICT positivity rate >= 1%), with infection rate from 1.0% (95% CI: 0.2-5.5) to 20.0% (95% CI: 10-30). The overall infection rate during the night blood survey was 0.11%(95% CI: 0.08-0.16) in 11 health districts out of the 106 surveyed; the arithmetic mean for microfilaria density was 1.19 mf/ml (95% CI: 0.13-2.26) for the total population examined. Conclusion/significance ICT card test results showed that LF was endemic in all the Regions and in about 90% of the health districts surveyed. All of these health districts qualified for MDA (i.e. ICT positivity rate >= 1%). Microfilariaemia data collected as part of this study provided the national program with baseline data (sentinel sites) necessary to measure the impact of MDA on the endemicity level and transmission of LF important for the 2020 deadline for global elimination.","[Nana-Djeunga, Hugues C.; Tchatchueng-Mbougua, Jules B.; Bopda, Jean; Mbickmen-Tchana, Steve; Kamgno, Joseph] Ctr Res Filariasis & Other Trop Dis CRFilMT, Yaounde, Cameroon; [Nana-Djeunga, Hugues C.] Univ Yaounde I, Fac Sci, Dept Anim Biol & Physiol, Parasitol & Ecol Lab, Yaounde, Cameroon; [Nnomzo'o, Etienne; Njiokou, Flobert] Minist Publ Hlth, NTD Control Program, Yaounde, Cameroon; [Akame, Julie; Tarini, Ann] Helen Keller Int, Yaounde, Cameroon; [Zhang, Yaobi] Helen Keller Int, Reg Off Africa, Dakar, Senegal; [Kamgno, Joseph] Univ Yaounde I, Fac Med & Biomed Sci, Yaounde, Cameroon","Kamgno, J (reprint author), Ctr Res Filariasis & Other Trop Dis CRFilMT, Yaounde, Cameroon.",kamgno@crfilmt.org,,,United States Agency for International Development (USAID) ENVISION Project through Helen Keller International; US Agency for International Development [AID-OAA-A-11-00048],"These surveys were funded by the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) ENVISION Project through Helen Keller International.

The existing drugs have significant deficiencies so there is an urgent need for new and improved drugs. In the human host, Leishmania are obligate intracellular parasites which poses particular challenges in terms of drug discovery. To achieve sufficient throughput and robustness, free-living parasites are often used in primary screening assays as a surrogate for the more complex intracellular assays. We and others have found that such axenic assays have a high false positive rate relative to the intracellular assays, and that this limits their usefulness as a primary platform for screening of large compound collections. While many different reasons could lie behind the poor translation from axenic parasite to intracellular parasite, we show here that a key factor is the identification of growth slowing and cytostatic compounds by axenic assays in addition to the more desirable cytocidal compounds. We present a screening cascade based on a novel cytocidal-only axenic amastigote assay, developed by increasing starting density of cells and lowering the limit of detection, and show that it has a much improved translation to the intracellular assay. We propose that this assay is an improved primary platform in a new Leishmania screening cascade designed for the screening of large compound collections. This cascade was employed to screen a diversity-oriented-synthesis library, and yielded two novel antileishmanial chemotypes. The approach we have taken may have broad relevance to anti-infective and anti-parasitic drug discovery.","[Nuehs, Andrea; De Rycker, Manu; Manthri, Sujatha; Gray, David W.] Univ Dundee, Drug Discovery Unit, Div Biol Chem & Drug Discovery, Dundee, Scotland; [Comer, Eamon; Scherer, Christina A.; Schreiber, Stuart L.] Broad Inst, Cambridge, MA USA; [Ioset, Jean-Robert] Drugs Neglected Dis Initiat, Geneva, Switzerland","Nuhs, A (reprint author), Univ Dundee, Drug Discovery Unit, Div Biol Chem & Drug Discovery, Dundee, Scotland.",d.w.gray@dundee.ac.uk,"Gray, David W/F-6674-2011","Gray, David W/0000-0001-9512-3828; De Rycker, Manu/0000-0002-3171-3519",Drugs for Neglected Diseases initiative; Department for International Development (UK); Reconstruction Credit Institution-Federal Ministry of Education and Research (KfW-BMBF; Germany); Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation (US); Medecins Sans Frontieres (Doctors without Borders); Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs (DGIS; The Netherlands); Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation (SDC; Switzerland); Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation [OPP1032518]; Wellcome Trust Strategic grant [100476/Z/12/Z],"This study was primarily funded by the Drugs for Neglected Diseases initiative (www.dndi.org).

Here we quantify mortality from RHD in Fiji during 2008-2012 in people aged 5-69 years. Methods and Findings Using 1,773,999 records derived from multiple sources of routine clinical and administrative data, we used probabilistic record-linkage to define a cohort of 2,619 persons diagnosed with RHD, observed for all-cause mortality over 11,538 person-years. Using relative survival methods, we estimated there were 378 RHD-attributable deaths, almost half of which occurred before age 40 years. Using census data as the denominator, we calculated there were 9.9 deaths (95% CI 9.8-10.0) and 331 years of life-lost (YLL, 95% CI 330.4-331.5) due to RHD per 100,000 person-years, standardised to the portion of the WHO World Standard Population aged 0-69 years. Valuing life using Fiji's per-capita gross domestic product, we estimated these deaths cost United States Dollar $6,077,431 annually. Compared to vital registration data for 2011-2012, we calculated there were 1.6-times more RHD-attributable deaths than the number reported, and found our estimate of RHD mortality exceeded all but the five leading reported causes of premature death, based on collapsed underlying cause-of-death diagnoses. Conclusions Rheumatic heart disease is a leading cause of premature death as well as an important economic burden in this setting. Age-standardised death rates are more than twice those reported in current global estimates. Linkage of routine data provides an efficient tool to better define the epidemiology of neglected diseases.","[Parks, Tom] Univ Oxford, Oxford, England; [Parks, Tom; Bailey, Robin L.] London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, London WC1, England; [Kado, Joseph; Tukana, Isimeli N.] Fiji Isl Minist Hlth, Suva, Fiji; [Miller, Anne E.] Townsville Gen Hosp, Douglas, Vic, Australia; [Ward, Brenton; Heenan, Rachel; Colquhoun, Samantha M.; Steer, Andrew C.] Murdoch Childrens Res Inst, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Heenan, Rachel; Steer, Andrew C.] Royal Childrens Hosp, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Colquhoun, Samantha M.; Steer, Andrew C.] Univ Melbourne, Ctr Int Child Hlth, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Baernighausen, Till W.; Bloom, David E.] Harvard Univ, Sch Publ Hlth, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Mirabel, Mariana] INSERM, Paris, France","Parks, T (reprint author), Univ Oxford, Oxford, England.",tomparks@well.ox.ac.uk,"Parks, Tom/D-7741-2013","Parks, Tom/0000-0002-1163-8654",Medical Research Council UK [G1100449]; British Medical Association; Sir Halley Stewart Trust; World Health Organisation; Medical Research Council [G1100449]; National Institute for Health Research [1400],"Funding for salaries and research costs was received from the Medical Research Council UK (Fellowship G1100449; http://www.mrc.ac.uk), the British Medical Association (Josephine Lansdell Grant; www.bma.org.uk) and the Sir Halley Stewart Trust (Research Grant; www.sirhalleystewart.org.uk) awarded to TP.

Methodology/Principal Findings We investigated the possible effects of CYP19A1 [rs11575899], NFK beta 1 [rs28362491], IL1 alpha [rs3783553], CASP8 [rs3834129], UGT1A1 [rs8175347], PAR1 [rs11267092], CYP2E1 [INDEL 96pb] and IL4 [rs79071878] genes in a group of 141 leprosy patients and 180 healthy individuals. The INDELs were typed by PCR Multiplex in ABI PRISM 3130 and analyzed with GeneMapper ID v3.2. The NFK beta 1, CASP8, PAR1 and IL4 INDELs were associated with leprosy susceptibility, while NFK beta 1, CASP8, PAR1 and CYP19A1 were associated with the MB (Multibacilary) clinical form of leprosy. Conclusions/Significance NFK beta 1 [rs28362491], CASP8 [rs3834129], PAR1 [rs11267092] and IL4 [rs79071878] genes are potential markers for susceptibility to leprosy development, while the INDELs in NFK beta 1, CASP8, PAR1 and CYP19A1 (rs11575899) are potential markers for the severe clinical form MB. Moreover, all of these markers are influenced by genetic ancestry, and European contribution increases the risk to leprosy development, in other hand an increase in African contribution generates protection against leprosy.","[Pinto, Pablo; Santos, Sidney; Ribeiro-dos-Santos, Andrea] Fed Univ Para, Inst Ciencias Biol, Lab Genet Humana & Med, BR-66059 Belem, Para, Brazil; [Pinto, Pablo; Carneiro Santos, Ney Pereira; Santos, Sidney; Ribeiro-dos-Santos, Andrea] Fed Univ Para, Nucleo Pesquisas Oncol, BR-66059 Belem, Para, Brazil; [Salgado, Claudio] Fed Univ Para, Inst Ciencias Biol, Lab Dermatoimunol, BR-66059 Belem, Para, Brazil","Pinto, P (reprint author), Fed Univ Para, Inst Ciencias Biol, Lab Genet Humana & Med, BR-66059 Belem, Para, Brazil.",akely@ufpa.br,"Salgado, Claudio G/K-8931-2012; Salgado, Claudio/C-5206-2014; Ribeiro-dos-Santos, Andrea/B-6061-2013","Salgado, Claudio/0000-0003-3961-7764; Ribeiro-dos-Santos, Andrea/0000-0001-7001-1483",FAPESPA (Fundacao Amazonia Paraense de Amparo a Pesquisa) ICAAF [155/2014]; CNPq (Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico) [CNPQ 481652/2012-4]; CAPES (Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento Pessoal de Nivel Superior); Rede de Pesquisa em Genomica Populacional Humana (RPGPH)-CAPES [CAPES-Proamazonia 3288/2013]; FADESP/PROPESP/UFPA (Universidade Federal do Para),"This study was supported by FAPESPA (Fundacao Amazonia Paraense de Amparo a Pesquisa) ICAAF 155/2014, CNPq (Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico), CNPQ 481652/2012-4, CAPES (Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento Pessoal de Nivel Superior), Rede de Pesquisa em Genomica Populacional Humana (RPGPH)-CAPES, CAPES-Proamazonia 3288/2013 and FADESP/PROPESP/UFPA (Universidade Federal do Para).

We hypothesized that immune activation from this gastrointestinal mucosa infection would increase highly HIV-susceptible CD4 T cell subsets in the blood and the foreskin through common mucosal homing. Methodology/Principal Findings Foreskin tissue and blood were obtained from 34 HIV- and malaria-uninfected Ugandan men who volunteered for elective circumcision, 12 of whom were definitively positive for S. mansoni eggs in stool and 12 definitively negative for both S. mansoni eggs and worm antigen. Tissue and blood T cell subsets were characterized by flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry (IHC). Th17 and Th1 cells from both the blood and foreskin expressed higher levels of CCR5 and were more activated than other CD4 T cell subsets. S. mansoni-infected men had a higher frequency of systemic Th1 cells (22.9 vs. 16.5% of blood CD4 T cells, p< 0.05), Th17 cells (2.3 vs. 1.5%, p< 0.05), and Th22 cells (0.5 vs. 0.3%, p< 0.01) than uninfected men. Additionally, Th17 cells in the blood of S. mansoni-infected men demonstrated enhanced function (28.1 vs. 16.3% producing multiple cytokines, p = 0.046). However, these immune alterations were not observed in foreskin tissue. Conclusions/Significance S. mansoni infection was associated with an increased frequency of highly HIV-susceptible Th1, Th17 and Th22 cell subsets in the blood, but these T cell immune differences did not extend to the foreskin. S. mansoni induced changes in T cell immunology mediated through the common mucosal immune system are not likely to increase HIV susceptibility in the foreskin.","[Prodger, Jessica L.; Kaul, Rupert] Univ Toronto, Dept Med, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Prodger, Jessica L.; Kaul, Rupert] Univ Toronto, Dept Immunol, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Ssemaganda, Aloysious; Ssetaala, Ali; Kitandwe, Paul K.; Muyanja, Enoch; Mpendo, Juliet; Nanvubya, Annet; Wambuzi, Mathias; Nielsen, Leslie; Kiwanuka, Noah] Uganda Virus Res Inst, Int AIDS Vaccine Initiat HIV Vaccine Program, Entebbe, Uganda; [Nielsen, Leslie] Int AIDS Vaccine Initiat, New York, NY USA; [Kiwanuka, Noah] Makerere Univ, Sch Publ Hlth, Coll Hlth Sci, Kampala, Uganda","Prodger, JL (reprint author), Univ Toronto, Dept Med, Toronto, ON, Canada.",prodge1@jhu.edu,,"Kaul, Rupert/0000-0002-1586-4093; Ssetaala, Ali/0000-0003-2156-3024","Canadian Institutes of Health Research [TMI-138656, HBF-137700]; Ontario HIV Treatment Network through the University of Toronto Endowed Chair in HIV Research; Ontario HIV Treatment Network [STU G708]; IAVI; USAID","Research was primarily funded by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (http://www.cihr-irsc.gc.ca) grant numbers TMI-138656 and HBF-137700 (RK).

To quantify the global research activity in this field, a scientometric investigation was conducted. We analyzed the research output of countries, individual institutions and their collaborative networks. The resulting research architecture indicated that American and European countries played a leading role regarding output activity, citations and multi- and bilateral cooperations. When related to population numbers, African countries, which usually do not dominate the global research in other medical fields, were among the most prolific nations.

There are few treatment options for individuals with Chagas' disease making it important to understand the molecular details of parasite infection, so novel therapeutic alternatives may be developed for these patients. Here, we investigate the interaction between host cell intermediate filament proteins and the T. cruzi gp85 glycoprotein superfamily with hundreds of members that have long been implicated in parasite cell invasion. Methodology/Principal Findings An in silico analysis was utilized to identify peptide motifs shared by the gp85 T. cruzi proteins and, using phage display, these selected peptide motifs were screened for their ability to bind to cells. One peptide, named TS9, showed significant cell binding capacity and was selected for further studies. Affinity chromatography, phage display and invasion assays revealed that peptide TS9 binds to cytokeratins and vimentin, and prevents T. cruzi cell infection. Interestingly, peptide TS9 and a previously identified binding site for intermediate filament proteins are disposed in an antiparallel beta-sheet fold, present in a conserved laminin-G-like domain shared by all members of the family. Moreover, peptide TS9 overlaps with an immunodominant T cell epitope. Conclusions/Significance Taken together, the present study reinforces previous results from our group implicating the gp85 superfamily of glycoproteins and the intermediate filament proteins cytokeratin and vimentin in the parasite infection process. It also suggests an important role in parasite biology for the conserved laminin-G-like domain, present in all members of this large family of cell surface proteins.","[Reis Teixeira, Andre Azevedo; Sardinha de Vasconcelos, Veronica de Cassia; Colli, Walter; Manso Alves, Maria Julia; Giordano, Ricardo Jose] Univ Sao Paulo, Dept Biochem, Inst Chem, Sao Paulo, Brazil","Teixeira, AAR (reprint author), Univ Sao Paulo, Dept Biochem, Inst Chem, Sao Paulo, Brazil.",giordano@iq.usp.br,"Alves, Maria Julia/K-8976-2012; Colli, Walter/G-1188-2012; Giordano, Ricardo/A-2074-2010; Teixeira, Andre/A-9487-2012","Alves, Maria Julia/0000-0001-7211-9631; Giordano, Ricardo/0000-0001-8116-6771; Teixeira, Andre/0000-0002-8348-0235; Colli, Walter/0000-0001-7305-4673","National Research Council (CNPq); Sao Paulo Research Foundation (FAPESP) [2012.13967-4, 2008/54806-8, 2013/16478-7, 2012/50188-3]","This work was supported by grants from National Research Council (CNPq; http://www.cnpq.br/)(RJG, MJMA and WC) and Sao Paulo Research Foundation (FAPESP; http://www.fapesp.br/en/) numbers 2012.13967-4 (AART) 2008/54806-8 (RJG), 2013/16478-7 (WC) and 2012/50188-3 (MJMA).

Inhibitors of sterol 14 alpha-demethylase (CYP51) have proven effective against T. cruzi in vitro and in vivo in animal models of Chagas disease. Consequently two azole inhibitors of CYP51 (posaconazole and ravuconazole) have recently entered clinical development by the Drugs for Neglected Diseases initiative. Further new drug treatments for this disease are however still urgently required, particularly having a different mode of action to CYP51 in order to balance the overall risk in the drug discovery portfolio. This need has now been further strengthened by the very recent reports of treatment failure in the clinic for both posaconazole and ravuconazole. To this end and to prevent enrichment of drug candidates against a single target, there is a clear need for a robust high throughput assay for CYP51 inhibition in order to evaluate compounds active against T. cruzi arising from phenotypic screens. A high throughput fluorescence based functional assay using recombinantly expressed T. cruzi CYP51 (Tulahuen strain) is presented here that meets this requirement. This assay has proved valuable in prioritising medicinal chemistry resource on only those T. cruzi active series arising from a phenotypic screening campaign where it is clear that the predominant mode of action is likely not via inhibition of CYP51.","[Riley, Jennifer; Brand, Stephen; Read, Kevin D.] Univ Dundee, Div Biol Chem & Drug Discovery, Drug Discovery Unit, Coll Life Sci, Dundee, Scotland; [Voice, Michael] CYPEX, Dundee, Scotland; [Caballero, Ivan; Calvo, David] GlaxoSmithKline, Ctr Invest Basica, Mol Discovery Res Tres Cantos, Tres Cantos, Spain","Riley, J (reprint author), Univ Dundee, Div Biol Chem & Drug Discovery, Drug Discovery Unit, Coll Life Sci, Dundee, Scotland.",k.read@dundee.ac.uk,,"Brand, Stephen/0000-0002-7010-5348","Wellcome Trust [WT092340, WT100476]","Funding under Wellcome Trust strategic award WT092340 and WT100476 supported this work for JR, SB and KR.

However, few molecular markers linked to resistance have been identified and characterized in snails. Methodology/Principal Findings Here we test six independent genetic loci for their influence on resistance to Schistosoma mansoni strain PR1 in the 13-16-R1 strain of the snail Biomphalaria glabrata. We first identify a genomic region, RADres, showing the highest differentiation between susceptible and resistant inbred lines among 1611 informative restriction-site associated DNA (RAD) markers, and show that it significantly influences resistance in an independent set of 439 outbred snails. The additive effect of each RADres resistance allele is 2-fold, similar to that of the previously identified resistance gene sod1. The data fit a model in which both loci contribute independently and additively to resistance, such that the odds of infection in homozygotes for the resistance alleles at both loci (13% infected) is 16-fold lower than the odds of infection in snails without any resistance alleles (70% infected). Genome-wide linkage disequilibrium is high, with both sod1 and RADres residing on haplotype blocks > 2Mb, and with other markers in each block also showing significant effects on resistance; thus the causal genes within these blocks remain to be demonstrated. Other candidate loci had no effect on resistance, including the Guadeloupe Resistance Complex and three genes (aif, infPhox, and prx1) with immunological roles and expression patterns tied to resistance, which must therefore be trans-regulated. Conclusions/Significance The loci RADres and sod1 both have strong effects on resistance to S. mansoni. Future approaches to control schistosomiasis may benefit from further efforts to characterize and harness this natural genetic variation.","[Tennessen, Jacob A.; Bonner, Kaitlin M.; Bollmann, Stephanie R.; Johnstun, Joel A.; Yeh, Jan-Ying; Marine, Melanie; Tavalire, Hannah F.; Bayne, Christopher J.; Blouin, Michael S.] Oregon State Univ, Dept Integrat Biol, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA","Tennessen, JA (reprint author), Oregon State Univ, Dept Integrat Biol, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA.",jacob.tennessen@gmail.com,,"Tennessen, Jacob/0000-0002-5015-4740","National Institutes of Health (NIH) [AI016137, AI109134]","This work was partially supported by National Institutes of Health (NIH; http://www.nih.gov/) grants AI016137 to CJB and AI109134 to MSB.

There is a need for an updated evaluation of the economic impact of dengue within the country. We undertook this multicenter study to evaluate the economic burden of dengue in Brazil. Methods We estimated the economic burden of dengue in Brazil for the years 2009 to 2013 and for the epidemic season of August 2012-September 2013. We conducted a multicenter cohort study across four endemic regions: Midwest, Goiania; Southeast, Belo Horizonte and Rio de Janeiro; Northeast: Teresina and Recife; and the North, Belem. Ambulatory or hospitalized cases with suspected or laboratory-confirmed dengue treated in both the private and public sectors were recruited. Interviews were scheduled for the convalescent period to ascertain characteristics of the dengue episode, date of first symptoms/signs and recovery, use of medical services, work/school absence, household spending (out-of-pocket expense) and income lost using a questionnaire developed for a previous cost study. We also extracted data from the patients' medical records for hospitalized cases. Overall costs per case and cumulative costs were calculated from the public payer and societal perspectives. National cost estimations took into account cases reported in the official notification system (SINAN) with adjustment for underreporting of cases. We applied a probabilistic sensitivity analysis using Monte Carlo simulations with 90% certainty levels (CL). Results We screened 2,223 cases, of which 2,035 (91.5%) symptomatic dengue cases were included in our study. The estimated cost for dengue for the epidemic season (2012-2013) in the societal perspective was US$ 468 million (90% CL: 349-590) or US$ 1,212 million (90% CL: 904-1,526) after adjusting for under-reporting. Considering the time series of dengue (2009-2013) the estimated cost of dengue varied from US$ 371 million (2009) to US$ 1,228 million (2013). Conclusions The economic burden associated with dengue in Brazil is substantial with large variations in reported cases and consequently costs reflecting the dynamic of dengue transmission.","[Turchi Martelli, Celina Maria; Braga, Cynthia; de Souza, Wayner Vieira] Fundacao Oswaldo Cruz, Aggeu Magalhaes Res Ctr, Dept Publ Hlth, Recife, PE, Brazil; [Turchi Martelli, Celina Maria; Siqueira Junior, Joao Bosco; de Sene Amancio Zara, Ana Laura] Univ Fed Goias, Inst Trop Pathol & Publ Hlth, Dept Community Hlth, Goiania, Go, Brazil; [Palha Dias Parente, Mirian Perpetua] Univ Estadual Piaui, Dept Community Hlth, Teresina, Brazil; [Oliveira, Consuelo Silva] Univ Estado Para, Belem, Para, Brazil; [Pimenta Junior, Fabiano Geraldo; Ooteman Mendes, Marcia Costa] Secretaria Municipal Saude Belo Horizonte, Dept Hlth Surveillance, Belo Horizonte, MG, Brazil; [Cortes, Fanny] Univ Pernambuco, Dept Hlth Sci, Recife, PE, Brazil; [Guillermo Lopez, Juan] Sanofi Pasteur Latin Amer, Hlth Econ & Market Access, Mexico City, DF, Mexico; [Bahia, Luciana Ribeiro; Machado da Rosa, Michelle Quarti] Univ Estado Rio De Janeiro, Dept Internal Med, Rio De Janeiro, Brazil; [de Siqueira Filha, Noemia Teixeira] London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, Dept Global Hlth & Dev, London WC1, England; [Constenla, Dagna] Johns Hopkins Univ, Dept Int Hlth, Bloomberg Sch Publ Hlth, Baltimore, MD USA","Martelli, CMT (reprint author), Fundacao Oswaldo Cruz, Aggeu Magalhaes Res Ctr, Dept Publ Hlth, Recife, PE, Brazil.",turchicm@gmail.com,"de Sene Amancio Zara, Ana Laura/P-3993-2019; Zara, Ana Laura S.

Many patients are exposed to the causative agent, however only a small number develop infection. M. mycetomatis contains chitin in its cell wall, which can trigger the human immune system. Polymorphisms in the genes encoding for the chitin-degrading enzymes chitotriosidase and AMCase were described, resulting in altered chitinase activity. We investigated the association between 4 of these polymorphisms and the incidence of M. mycetomatis mycetoma in a Sudanese population. Methodology Polymorphisms studied in 112 eumycetoma patients and 103 matched controls included a 24-bp insertion in the chitotriosidase gene (rs3831317), resulting in impaired chitinase activity and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the AMCase gene (rs61756687), resulting in decreased AMCase activity. Also, a SNP (rs41282492) and a 10-bp insertion in the 5'UTR region of the AMCase gene (rs143789088) were studied, both resulting in increased AMCase activity. DNA was isolated from blood and genotypes were determined using PCR-RFLP. Principal Findings Histological staining proved the presence of chitin in the fungal grain. The polymorphism resulting in decreased chitotriosidase activity was associated with increased odds of eumycetoma (odds ratio 2.9; p = 0.004). No association was found for the polymorphisms in the genes for AMCase (all p> 0.05). Conclusion Decreased chitotriosidase activity was associated with increased risk of M. mycetomatis mycetoma.","[Verwer, Patricia E.

ENL is associated with skin lesions, neuritis, arthritis, dactylitis, eye inflammation, osteitis, orchitis, lymphadenitis and nephritis. The treatment of ENL requires immunosuppression, which is often required for prolonged periods of time and may lead to serious adverse effects. ENL and its treatment is associated with increased mortality and economic hardship. Improved, evidence-based treatments for ENL are needed; however, defining the severity of ENL and outcome measures for treatment studies is difficult because of the multiple organ systems involved. A cross-sectional study was performed, by the members of the Erythema Nodosum Leprosum International STudy (ENLIST) Group, of patients with ENL attending seven leprosy referral centres in Brazil, Ethiopia, India, Nepal, the Philippines and the United Kingdom. We systematically documented the clinical features and type of ENL, its severity and the drugs used to treat it. Patients with chronic ENL were more likely to be assessed as having severe ENL. Pain, the most frequent symptom, assessed using a semi-quantitative scale was significantly worse in individuals with ""severe"" ENL. Our findings will determine the items to be included in a severity scale of ENL which we are developing and validating. The study also provides data on the clinical features of ENL, which can be incorporated into a definition of ENL and used for outcome measures in treatment studies.","[Walker, Stephen L.; Lockwood, Diana N.

In this regard, there is growing interest in exploring known drug leads of human epigenetic enzymes as potential starting points to develop novel treatments for parasitic diseases. This approach of repurposing (starting with validated targets and inhibitors) is quite attractive since it has the potential to reduce the expense of drug development and accelerate the process of developing novel drug candidates for parasite control. Lysine deacetylases (KDACs) are among the most studied epigenetic drug targets of humans, and a broad range of small-molecule inhibitors for these enzymes have been reported. In this work, we identify the KDAC protein families in representative species across important classes of parasites, screen a compound library of 23 hydroxamate-or benzamide-based small molecules KDAC inhibitors, and report their activities against a range of parasitic species, including the pathogen of malaria (Plasmodium falciparum), kinetoplastids (Trypanosoma brucei and Leishmania donovani), and nematodes (Brugia malayi, Dirofilaria immitis and Haemonchus contortus). Compound activity against parasites is compared to that observed against the mammalian cell line (L929 mouse fibroblast) in order to determine potential parasite-versus-host selectivity). The compounds showed nanomolar to sub-nanomolar potency against various parasites, and some selectivity was observed within the small panel of compounds tested. The possible bindingmodes of the active compounds at the different protein target sites within different species were explored by docking to homology models to help guide the discovery ofmore selective, parasite-specific inhibitors. This current work supports previous studies that explored the use of KDAC inhibitors in targeting Plasmodium to develop new anti-malarial treatments, and also pioneers experiments with these KDAC inhibitors as potential new anthelminthics. The selectivity observed begins to address the challenges of targeting specific parasitic diseases while limiting host toxicity.","[Wang, Qi; Rosa, Bruce A.; Mitreva, Makedonka] Washington Univ, Sch Med, Genome Inst, St Louis, MO 63108 USA; [Nare, Bakela; Powell, Kerrie] SCYNEXIS Inc, Res Triangle Pk, NC USA; [Valente, Sergio; Rotili, Dante; Mai, Antonello] Univ Roma La Sapienza, Inst Pasteur, Fdn Cenci Bolognetti, Dipartimento Chim & Tecnol Farmaco, I-00185 Rome, Italy; [Marshall, Garland R.] Washington Univ, Dept Biochem & Mol Biophys, St Louis, MO USA; [Mitreva, Makedonka] Washington Univ, Sch Med, Dept Genet, St Louis, MO 63110 USA; [Mitreva, Makedonka] Washington Univ, Sch Med, Dept Internal Med, St Louis, MO 63110 USA","Wang, Q (reprint author), Washington Univ, Sch Med, Genome Inst, St Louis, MO 63108 USA.",mmitreva@genome.wustl.edu,"Rotili, Dante/J-9157-2016; Valente, Sergio/K-2198-2016","Valente, Sergio/0000-0002-2241-607X; Mitreva, Makedonka/0000-0001-9572-3436; Rotili, Dante/0000-0002-8428-8763; Mai, Antonello/0000-0001-9176-2382; Marshall, Garland/0000-0002-3098-0332","National Institute of Health (NIH) National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) [AI081803]; Scynexis, Inc.","This work was supported by the National Institute of Health (NIH) National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) Grant #AI081803 to MM.

The interaction between the parasite and host, both mosquito and human, during infection, development and persistence is dynamic and delicately balanced. Manipulation of this interface to the detriment of the parasite is a promising potential avenue to develop disease therapies but is prevented by our very limited understanding of the host-parasite relationship. Exosomes are bioactive small vesicles (30-120 nm) secreted by a wide range of cell types and involved in a wide range of physiological processes. Here, we report the identification and partial characterization of exosome-like vesicles (ELVs) released from the infective L3 stage of the human filarial parasite Brugia malayi. Exosome-like vesicles were isolated from parasites in culture media and electron microscopy and nanoparticle tracking analysis were used to confirm that vesicles produced by juvenile B. malayi are exosome-like based on size and morphology. We show that loss of parasite viability correlates with a time-dependent decay in vesicle size specificity and rate of release. The protein cargo of these vesicles is shown to include common exosomal protein markers and putative effector proteins. These Brugia-derived vesicles contain small RNA species that include microRNAs with host homology, suggesting a potential role in host manipulation. Confocal microscopy shows J774A.1, a murine macrophage cell line, internalize purified ELVs, and we demonstrate that these ELVs effectively stimulate a classically activated macrophage phenotype in J774A.1. To our knowledge, this is the first report of exosome-like vesicle release by a human parasitic nematode and our data suggest a novel mechanism by which human parasitic nematodes may actively direct the host responses to infection. Further interrogation of the makeup and function of these bioactive vesicles could seed new therapeutic strategies and unearth stage-specific diagnostic biomarkers.","[Zamanian, Mostafa; Fraser, Lisa M.; Agbedanu, Prince N.; Harischandra, Hiruni; Day, Tim A.; Kimber, Michael J.] Iowa State Univ, Dept Biomed Sci, Ames, IA 50010 USA; [Zamanian, Mostafa] Northwestern Univ, Dept Mol Biosci, Evanston, IL USA; [Moorhead, Andrew R.] Univ Georgia, Dept Infect Dis, Athens, GA 30602 USA; [Bartholomay, Lyric C.] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Pathobiol Sci, Madison, WI 53706 USA","Zamanian, M (reprint author), Iowa State Univ, Dept Biomed Sci, Ames, IA 50010 USA.",michaelk@iastate.edu,,"Day, Tim/0000-0002-9037-6540; Zamanian, Mostafa/0000-0001-9233-1760",National Institute of Food and Agriculture [1001501],"This work was supported by National Institute of Food and Agriculture Award 1001501 to MJK.

However, factors affecting the survival of the disease remain unclear. Here, we investigated the prognostic factors of Ebola virus disease (EVD) through various statistical models. Methodology/Principal Findings Sixty three laboratory-confirmed EVD patients with relatively complete clinical profiles were included in the study. All the patients were recruited at Jui Government Hospital, Sierra Leone between October 1st, 2014 and January 18th, 2015. We first investigated whether a single clinical presentation would be correlated with the survival of EVD. Log-rank test demonstrated that patients with viral load higher than 10(6) copies/ml presented significantly shorter survival time than those whose viral load were lower than 10(6) copies/ml (P = 0.005). Also, using Pearson chi-square test, we identified that chest pain, coma, and viral load (> 10(6) copies/ml) were significantly associated with poor survival of EVD patients. Furthermore, we evaluated the effect of multiple variables on the survival of EVD by Cox proportional hazards model. Interestingly, results revealed that patient's age, symptom of confusion, and viral load were the significantly associated with the survival of EVD cases (P = 0.017, P = 0.002, and P = 0.027, respectively). Conclusions/Significance These results suggest that age, chest pain, coma, confusion and viral load are associated with the prognosis of EVD, in which viral load could be one of the most important factors for the survival of the disease.","[Zhang, Xin] Peoples Liberat Army Gen Hosp, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Xin; Rong, Yihui; Sun, Lijian; Liu, Liming; Su, Haibin; Zhang, Jian; Teng, Guangju; Du, Ning; Chen, Haoyang; Jin, Bo; Xu, Zhe] Beijing 302 Hosp, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Fang, Yuan; Zhan, Wei] BGC Biotechnol Res Ctr, Jinan, Shandong, Peoples R China; [Kanu, Alex B.

Male outbred Kunming mice infected with E. multilocularis Metacestodes were administered with three ABZ formulations, namely, ABZ-CS-MPs, Liposome-Albendazole (L-ABZ), and albendazole tablet (ABZ-T). Each of the ABZ formulations was given orally at three different doses of 37.5, 75, and 150mg/kg, three times a week for 12 weeks postinfection. After administering the drugs, we monitored the pharmacological performance and anti-parasitic efficacy of ABZ-CS-MPs compared with L-ABZ, and ABZ-T treated mice. ABZ-CS-MPs reduced the weight of tissues containing E. multilocularis metacestodes most effectively compared with the ABZ-T group and untreated controls. Metacestode grown was Highly suppressed during treatment with ABZ-CS-MPs. Significantly higher plasma levels of ABZ metabolites were measured in mice treated with ABZ-CS-MPs or L-ABZ compared with ABZ-T. In particular, enhanced ABZ-sulfoxide concentration profiles were observed in the mice given 150mg/kg of ABZ-CS-MPs, but not in the mice treated with L-ABZ. Histological examination showed that damages caused disorganization of both the germinal and laminated layers of liver hyatid cysts, demolishing their characteristic structures after treatment with ABZ-CS-MPs or L-ABZ. Over time, ABZ-CS-MPs treatment induced a shift from Th2-dominant to Th1-dominant immune response. CS-MPs As a new carrier exhibited improved absorption and increased bioavailability of ABZ in the treatment of E. multilocularis infections in mice.","[Abulaihaiti, Maitiseyiti; Wu, Xiang-Wei; Qiao, Lei; Lv, Hai-Long; Zhang, Hong-Wei; Aduwayi, Nasrul; Wang, Yan-Jie; Peng, Xin-Yu] Shihezi Univ, Sch Med, Affiliated Hosp 1, Dept Hepatobiliary Surg, Shihezi, Xinjiang, Peoples R China; [Wang, Xin-Chun] Shihezi Univ, Sch Med, Affiliated Hosp 1, Dept Pharm, Shihezi, Xinjiang, Peoples R China","Peng, XY (reprint author), Shihezi Univ, Sch Med, Affiliated Hosp 1, Dept Hepatobiliary Surg, Shihezi, Xinjiang, Peoples R China.",cwjwxc@163.com; pengxinyu2000@sina.com,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [81260412, 81360453]","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC nos. 81260412 and 81360453).

Therefore, there is a pressing need to understand the molecular effects of PZQ on schistosomes and to investigate alternative or synergistic drugs against schistosomiasis. Methodology We used a custom-designed Schistosoma mansoni expression microarray to explore the effects of sublethal doses of PZQ on large-scale gene expression of adult paired males and females and unpaired mature females. We also assessed the efficacy of PZQ, omeprazole (OMP) or their combination against S. mansoni adult worms with a survival in vitro assay. Principal Findings We identified sets of genes that were affected by PZQ in paired and unpaired mature females, however with opposite gene expression patterns (up-regulated in paired and down-regulated in unpaired mature females), indicating that PZQ effects are heavily influenced by the mating status. We also identified genes that were similarly affected by PZQ in males and females. Functional analyses of gene interaction networks were performed with parasite genes that were differentially expressed upon PZQ treatment, searching for proteins encoded by these genes whose human homologs are targets of different drugs used for other diseases. Based on these results, OMP, a widely prescribed proton pump inhibitor known to target the ATP1A2 gene product, was chosen and tested. Sublethal doses of PZQ combined with OMP significantly increased worm mortality in vitro when compared with PZQ or OMP alone, thus evidencing a synergistic effect. Conclusions Functional analysis of gene interaction networks is an important approach that can point to possible novel synergistic drug candidates. We demonstrated the potential of this strategy by showing that PZQ in combination with OMP displayed increased efficiency against S. mansoni adult worms in vitro when compared with either drug alone.","[Almeida, Giulliana T.; Anderson, Leticia; Venancio, Thiago M.; Nakaya, Helder I.; Verjovski-Almeida, Sergio] Univ Sao Paulo, Inst Quim, Dept Bioquim, BR-01498 Sao Paulo, Brazil; [Lage, Regina C.

In Brazil, Leishmania (Viannia) braziliensis is a major etiological agent of cutaneous (CL) and mucosal leishmaniasis (MCL), a disfiguring form of the disease, which occurs in similar to 10% of L. braziliensis-infected patients. Thus, clinical isolates from patients with CL and MCL may be a relevant source of information to uncover parasite factors contributing to pathogenesis. In this study, we investigated two pairs of L. (V.) braziliensis isolates from mucosal (LbrM) and cutaneous (LbrC) sites of the same patient to identify factors distinguishing parasites that migrate from those that remain at the primary site of infection. Methodology/Principal Findings We observed no major genomic divergences among the clinical isolates by molecular karyotype and genomic sequencing. RT-PCR revealed that the isolates lacked Leishmania RNA virus (LRV). However, the isolates exhibited distinct in vivo pathogenesis in BALB/c mice; the LbrC isolates were more virulent than the LbrM isolates. Metabolomic analysis revealed significantly increased levels of 14 metabolites in LbrC parasites and 31 metabolites in LbrM parasites that were mainly related to inflammation and chemotaxis. A proteome comparative analysis revealed the overexpression of LbrPGF2S (prostaglandin f2-alpha synthase) and HSP70 in both LbrC isolates. Overexpression of LbrPGF2S in LbrC and LbrM promastigotes led to an increase in infected macrophages and the number of amastigotes per cell at 24-48 h post-infection (p.i.). Conclusions/Significance Despite sharing high similarity at the genome structure and ploidy levels, the parasites exhibited divergent expressed genomes. The proteome and metabolome results indicated differential profiles between the cutaneous and mucosal isolates, primarily related to inflammation and chemotaxis. BALB/c infection revealed that the cutaneous isolates were more virulent than the mucosal parasites. Furthermore, our data suggest that the LbrPGF2S protein is a candidate to contribute to parasite virulence profiles in the mammalian host.","[Alves-Ferreira, Eliza V.

S. aureus isolates from different BU patients with overlapping visits to the clinic were whole-genome sequenced and analyzed by a gene-by-gene approach using SeqSphere(+) software. In addition, sequence data were screened for the presence of genes that conferred antibiotic resistance. Principal Findings SeqSphere(+) analysis of whole-genome sequence data confirmed transmission of methicillin resistant S. aureus (MRSA) and methicillin susceptible S. aureus among patients that took place during wound care.

Blood, however, may be difficult to draw in some patients, especially in children, and sampling during outbreak investigations or epidemiological studies may face logistical challenges or limited compliance to invasive procedures from subjects. The aim of this study was to assess the possibility of using saliva and urine samples instead of blood for dengue diagnosis. Methodology/Principal Findings Serial plasma, urine and saliva samples were collected at several time-points between the day of admission to hospital until three months after the onset of fever in children with confirmed dengue disease. Quantitative RT-PCR, NS1 antigen capture and ELISA serology for anti-DENV antibody (IgG, IgM and IgA) detection were performed in parallel on the three body fluids. RT-PCR and NS1 tests demonstrated an overall sensitivity of 85.4%/63.4%, 41.6%/14.5% and 39%/28.3%, in plasma, urine and saliva specimens, respectively. When urine and saliva samples were collected at the same time-points and tested concurrently, the diagnostic sensitivity of RNA and NS1 detection assays was 69.1% and 34.4%, respectively. IgG/IgA detection assays had an overall sensitivity of 54.4%/37.4%, 38.5%/26.8% and 52.9%/28.6% in plasma, urine and saliva specimens, respectively. IgM were detected in 38.1% and 36% of the plasma and saliva samples but never in urine. Conclusions Although the performances of the different diagnostic methods were not as good in saliva and urine as in plasma specimens, the results obtained by qRT-PCR and by anti-DENV antibody ELISA could well justify the use of these two body fluids to detect dengue infection in situations when the collection of blood specimens is not possible.","[Andries, Anne-Claire; Duong, Veasna; Ros, Sopheaktra; Ong, Sivuth; Horwood, Paul; Buchy, Philippe] Inst Pasteur Cambodia, Virol Unit, Phnom Penh, Cambodia; [Ly, Sowath; Cappelle, Julien; Tarantola, Arnaud] Inst Pasteur Cambodia, Epidemiol & Publ Hlth Unit, Phnom Penh, Cambodia; [Cappelle, Julien] Ctr Cooperat Int Rech Agron Dev CIRAD, Unite AGIRs, Montpellier, France; [Kim, Kim Srorn; Try, Patrich Lorn] Kampong Cham Prov Hosp, Dept Pediat, Kampong Cham, Cambodia; [Huy, Rekol] Minist Hlth, Ctr Natl Malariol, Phnom Penh, Cambodia; [Flamand, Marie] Inst Pasteur, Struct Virol Unit, Paris, France; [Flamand, Marie] Inst Pasteur, CNRS UMR 3569, Paris, France; [Sakuntabhai, Anavaj] Inst Pasteur, Funct Genet Infect Dis Unit, Paris, France; [Sakuntabhai, Anavaj] CNRS, Unite Rech Associee, Paris, France; [Buchy, Philippe] GlaxoSmithKline Vaccines, Vaccine Value & Hlth Sci, Singapore, Singapore","Andries, AC (reprint author), Inst Pasteur Cambodia, Virol Unit, Phnom Penh, Cambodia.",buchyphilippe@hotmail.com,"Tarantola, Arnaud/D-2149-2015; Duong, Veasna/I-9684-2014","Tarantola, Arnaud/0000-0002-6946-7958; Cappelle, Julien/0000-0001-7668-1971; Horwood, Paul/0000-0001-9622-0742; BUCHY, Philippe/0000-0003-1372-3008; Duong, Veasna/0000-0003-0353-1678",European Union [282 378],"The research leading to these results has received funding from the European Union Seventh Framework Programme (FP7/2007/2011) under Grant Agreement no282 378.

Previous in vitro studies have shown that lipids and lipoproteins play a role in modifying virus infectivity. However, the relationship between development of severe dengue and total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), respectively, is unclear. We analyzed data from 789 laboratory-confirmed dengue cases and 447 other febrile illnesses (OFI) in a prospective pediatric hospital-based study in Managua, Nicaragua between August 2005 and January 2013, using three different classifications of dengue severity: World Health Organization (WHO) 1997, WHO 2009, and standardized intervention categories. Total serum cholesterol and LDL-C levels decreased over the course of illness and were generally lower with increasing dengue severity, regardless of classification scheme. Greater decreases in LDL-C than HDL-C were observed among dengue-positive patients compared to patients with OFI and among severe dengue compared to mild dengue cases. Furthermore, daily cholesterol levels declined with daily albumin blood levels. To examine the effect of cholesterol at presentation on subsequent risk of development of severe dengue, relative risks and 95% confidence intervals were calculated using multivariable modified Poisson models. We found that lower total serum cholesterol and LDL-C levels at presentation were associated with subsequent risk of developing dengue hemorrhagic fever/dengue shock syndrome using the WHO 1997 dengue severity classification, and thus that the reduction in LDL-C is likely driving the decreases observed in total serum cholesterol levels among dengue-positive patients. Our results suggest that cholesterol blood levels are important correlates of dengue pathophysiology and should be explored as part of a prognostic biomarker panel for severe dengue.","[Biswas, Hope H.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Sch Publ Hlth, Div Epidemiol, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Gordon, Aubree] Univ Michigan, Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Epidemiol, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Nunez, Andrea; Balmaseda, Angel] Minist Hlth, Ctr Nacl Diagnost Referencia, Lab Nacl Virol, Managua, Nicaragua; [Perez, Maria Angeles] Hosp Infantil Manuel Jesus Rivera, Managua, Nicaragua; [Harris, Eva] Univ Calif Berkeley, Sch Publ Hlth, Div Infect Dis & Vaccinol, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA","Biswas, HH (reprint author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Sch Publ Hlth, Div Epidemiol, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",eharris@berkeley.edu,,"Gordon, Aubree/0000-0002-9352-7877","National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease of the National Institutes of Health [U54 AI065359, R42 AI062100, K02 TW009483]","This study was supported by grants U54 AI065359 (AB), R42 AI062100 (EH), K02 TW009483 (AG), and U54 AI065359 (AB) from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease of the National Institutes of Health.

Due to colonization, the contemporary Colombian population is an admixture of Native-American, European and African ancestries. Because microorganisms are known to accompany humans during migrations, patterns of human migration can be traced by examining genomic changes in associated microbes. The current study analyzed 118 leprosy cases and 116 unrelated controls from two Colombian regions endemic for leprosy (Atlantic and Andean) in order to determine possible associations of leprosy with patient ancestral background (determined using 36 ancestry informative markers), Mycobacterium leprae genotype and/or patient geographical origin. We found significant differences between ancestral genetic composition. European components were predominant in Andean populations. In contrast, African components were higher in the Atlantic region. M. leprae genotypes were then analyzed for cluster associations and compared with the ancestral composition of leprosy patients. Two M. leprae principal clusters were found: haplotypes C54 and T45. Haplotype C54 associated with African origin and was more frequent in patients from the Atlantic region with a high African component. In contrast, haplotype T45 associated with European origin and was more frequent in Andean patients with a higher European component. These results suggest that the human and M. leprae genomes have co-existed since the African and European origins of the disease, with leprosy ultimately arriving in Colombia during colonization. Distinct M. leprae strains followed European and African settlement in the country and can be detected in contemporary Colombian populations.","[Cardona-Castro, Nora; Beltran, Camilo; Romero, Marcela] Univ CES, Inst Colombiano Med Trop, Sabaneta, Antioquia, Colombia; [Cortes, Edwin; Bedoya, Gabriel] Univ Antioquia, Inst Biol, Grp GENMOL, Medellin, Colombia; [Badel-Mogollon, Jaime E.] Skandha EIT SAS, Medellin, Colombia","Cardona-Castro, N (reprint author), Univ CES, Inst Colombiano Med Trop, Sabaneta, Antioquia, Colombia.",ncardona@ces.edu.co,"Cardona-Castro, Nora/L-6846-2015","Cardona-Castro, Nora/0000-0002-4716-6636",COLCIENCIAS [325651928980]; Estrategia de Sostenibilidad Universidad de Antioquia,"This project was financed by COLCIENCIAS grant number 325651928980 to NCC.

Resolving PZQ-engaged targets and effectors is important for identifying new druggable pathways that may yield novel antiparasitic agents. Here we use functional, genetic and pharmacological approaches to reveal that serotonergic signals antagonize PZQ action in vivo. Exogenous 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) rescued PZQ-evoked polarity and mobility defects in free-living planarian flatworms. In contrast, knockdown of a prevalently expressed planarian 5-HT receptor potentiated or phenocopied PZQ action in different functional assays. Subsequent screening of serotonergic ligands revealed that several ergot alkaloids possessed broad efficacy at modulating regenerative outcomes and the mobility of both free living and parasitic flatworms. Ergot alkaloids that phenocopied PZQ in regenerative assays to cause bipolar regeneration exhibited structural modifications consistent with serotonergic blockade. These data suggest that serotonergic activation blocks PZQ action in vivo, while serotonergic antagonists phenocopy PZQ action. Importantly these studies identify the ergot alkaloid scaffold as a promising structural framework for designing potent agents targeting parasitic bioaminergic G protein coupled receptors.","[Chan, John D.; Grab, Thomas; Marchant, Jonathan S.] Univ Minnesota, Dept Pharmacol, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA; [Agbedanu, Prince N.; Zamanian, Mostafa; Day, Timothy A.] Iowa State Univ, Dept Biomed Sci, Ames, IA USA; [Dosa, Peter I.] Univ Minnesota, Inst Therapeut Discovery & Dev, Minneapolis, MN USA; [Marchant, Jonathan S.] Univ Minnesota, Stem Cell Inst, Minneapolis, MN USA","Marchant, JS (reprint author), Univ Minnesota, Dept Pharmacol, 3-249 Millard Hall, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA.",march029@umn.edu,"MARCHANT, Jonathan/B-8051-2009; Marchant, Jonathan/Q-5484-2019; Marchant, Jonathan/C-3642-2019","MARCHANT, Jonathan/0000-0001-6592-0877; Marchant, Jonathan/0000-0001-6592-0877; Marchant, Jonathan/0000-0001-6592-0877; Chan, John/0000-0003-4986-972X; Day, Tim/0000-0002-9037-6540; Zamanian, Mostafa/0000-0001-9233-1760; Dosa, Peter/0000-0002-0081-3867",NIH [GM088790]; NSF [MCB0919933]; Stem Cell Biology Training Grant studentship [T32HD060536]; Graduate Student Fellowship (U of MN Graduate School),"Work was supported by the NIH (GM088790 to JSM) and NSF (MCB0919933 to JSM).

Although leptospirosis is a life-threatening disease and recognized as an important cause of pulmonary haemorrhage syndrome, the lack of global estimates for morbidity and mortality has contributed to its neglected disease status. Methodology/Principal Findings We conducted a systematic review of published morbidity and mortality studies and databases to extract information on disease incidence and case fatality ratios. Linear regression and Monte Carlo modelling were used to obtain age and gender-adjusted estimates of disease morbidity for countries and Global Burden of Disease (GBD) and WHO regions. We estimated mortality using models that incorporated age and gender-adjusted disease morbidity and case fatality ratios. The review identified 80 studies on disease incidence from 34 countries that met quality criteria. In certain regions, such as Africa, few quality assured studies were identified. The regression model, which incorporated country-specific variables of population structure, life expectancy at birth, distance from the equator, tropical island, and urbanization, accounted for a significant proportion (R-2 = 0.60) of the variation in observed disease incidence. We estimate that there were annually 1.03 million cases (95% CI 434,000-1,750,000) and 58,900 deaths (95% CI 23,800-95,900) due to leptospirosis worldwide. A large proportion of cases (48%, 95% CI 40-61%) and deaths (42%, 95% CI 34-53%) were estimated to occur in adult males with age of 20-49 years. Highest estimates of disease morbidity and mortality were observed in GBD regions of South and Southeast Asia, Oceania, Caribbean, Andean, Central, and Tropical Latin America, and East Sub-Saharan Africa. Conclusions / Significance Leptospirosis is among the leading zoonotic causes of morbidity worldwide and accounts for numbers of deaths, which approach or exceed those for other causes of haemorrhagic fever. Highest morbidity and mortality were estimated to occur in resource-poor countries, which include regions where the burden of leptospirosis has been underappreciated.","[Costa, Federico; Hagan, Jose E.; Calcagno, Juan; Martinez-Silveira, Martha S.; Ko, Albert I.] Brazilian Minist Hlth, Oswaldo Cruz Fdn, Salvador, BA, Brazil; [Costa, Federico] Univ Fed Bahia, Inst Collect Hlth, Salvador, BA, Brazil; [Costa, Federico; Hagan, Jose E.; Ko, Albert I.] Yale Univ, Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Epidemiol Microbial Dis, New Haven, CT USA; [Kane, Michael] Yale Univ, Sch Publ Hlth, Ctr Analyt Sci, New Haven, CT USA; [Torgerson, Paul] Univ Zurich, Vetsuisse Fac, Epidemiol Sect, Zurich, Switzerland; [Stein, Claudia] UN City, Reg Off Europe, WHO, Div Informat Evidence Res & Innovat, Copenhagen O, Denmark; [Abela-Ridder, Bernadette] WHO, Dept Control Neglected Trop Dis, CH-1211 Geneva, Switzerland","Costa, F (reprint author), Brazilian Minist Hlth, Oswaldo Cruz Fdn, Salvador, BA, Brazil.",albert.ko@yale.edu,"Hagan, Jose/N-6719-2019; Torgerson, Paul/A-7510-2010; Costa, Federico/G-1838-2015; Ko, Albert Icksang/P-2343-2015; Torgerson, Paul R/M-4447-2013; Martinez-Silveira, Martha Silvia/O-7270-2014","Hagan, Jose/0000-0002-1837-6319; Torgerson, Paul/0000-0003-4277-9983; Costa, Federico/0000-0001-6951-2336; Ko, Albert Icksang/0000-0001-9023-2339; Torgerson, Paul R/0000-0003-4277-9983; Martinez-Silveira, Martha Silvia/0000-0002-1004-1784","World Health Organization; Brazilian Ministry of Education; National Institutes of Health [R01 AI052473, U01 AI088752, D43 TW00919, R25 TW009338, T32 AI007172, R24 TW007988]; Wellcome Trust [102330/Z/13/Z]","This work was supported by the World Health Organization, Brazilian Ministry of Education, National Institutes of Health (R01 AI052473, U01 AI088752, D43 TW00919, R25 TW009338, T32 AI007172, R24 TW007988) and Wellcome Trust (102330/Z/13/Z).

The YF vaccine has been produced since 1937 in embryonated chicken eggs inoculated with the YF 17D virus. Yet, little information is available about the infection mechanism of YF 17DD virus in this biological model. To better understand this mechanism, we infected embryos of Gallus gallus domesticus and analyzed their histopathology after 72 hours of YF infection. Some embryos showed few apoptotic bodies in infected tissues, suggesting mild focal infection processes. Confocal and super-resolution microscopic analysis allowed us to identify as targets of viral infection: skeletal muscle cells, cardiomyocytes, nervous system cells, renal tubular epithelium, lung parenchyma, and fibroblasts associated with connective tissue in the perichondrium and dermis. The virus replication was heaviest in muscle tissues. In all of these specimens, RT-PCR methods confirmed the presence of replicative intermediate and genomic YF RNA. This clearer characterization of cell targets in chicken embryos paves the way for future development of a new YF vaccine based on a new cell culture system.","[de Abreu Manso, Pedro Paulo; Dias de Oliveira, Barbara C.

Knowledge on current pain assessment and treatment in BU is necessary to develop and implement a future guideline on pain management in BU. Methodology A mixed methods approach was used, consisting of information retrieved from medical records on prescribed pain medication from Ghana and Benin, and semi-structured interviews with health care personnel (HCP) from Ghana on pain perceptions, assessment and treatment. Medical records (n = 149) of patients treated between 2008 and 2012 were collected between November 2012 and August 2013. Interviews (n = 11) were audio-taped, transcribed verbatim and qualitatively analyzed. Principal Findings In 113 (84%) of the 135 included records, pain medication, mostly simple analgesics, was prescribed. In 48% of the prescriptions, an indication was not documented. HCP reported that advanced BU could be painful, especially after wound care and after a skin graft. They reported not be trained in the assessment of mild pain. Pain recognition was perceived as difficult, as patients were said to suppress or to exaggerate pain, and to have different expectations regarding acceptable pain levels. HCP reported a fear of side effects of pain medication, shortage and irregularities in the supply of pain medication, and time constraints among medical doctors for pain management. Conclusions Professionals perceived BU disease as potentially painful, and predominantly focused on severe pain. Our study suggests that pain in BU deserves attention and should be integrated in current treatment.","[de Zeeuw, Janine; van der Werf, Tjip S.; Loth, Susanne; Stienstra, Ymkje] Univ Groningen, Univ Med Ctr Groningen, Dept Internal Med Infect Dis, Groningen, Netherlands; [Alferink, Marike; Ranchor, Adelita V.] Univ Groningen, Univ Med Ctr Groningen, Dept Hlth Psychol, Groningen, Netherlands; [Barogui, Yves T.; Sopoh, Ghislain] Minist Sante, Programme Natl Lutte Lepre & l Ulcere Buruli, Cotonou, Benin; [Phillips, Richard O.] Kwame Nkrumah Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Med Sci, Dept Med, Kumasi, Ghana; [Molenbuur, Bouwe] Univ Groningen, Univ Med Ctr Groningen, Dept Anesthesiol, Groningen, Netherlands; [Plantinga, Mirjam] Univ Groningen, Univ Med Ctr Groningen, Dept Genet, Groningen, Netherlands","de Zeeuw, J (reprint author), Univ Groningen, Univ Med Ctr Groningen, Dept Internal Med Infect Dis, Groningen, Netherlands.",j.de.zeeuw@umcg.nl,"Stienstra, Ymkje/F-2222-2010","Stienstra, Ymkje/0000-0002-8844-8859; Phillips, Richard/0000-0001-8992-0222; SOPOH, Ghislain Emmanuel/0000-0003-1237-1047; van der Werf, Tjip/0000-0002-4824-1642","Gratama Foundation; research institute SHARE, Graduate School of Medical Sciences of the UMC Groningen; Dutch Organization for Scientific Research; Medical Research Council [MR/J01477X/1]","This work was supported by the Gratama Foundation, and by the research institute SHARE, which is part of the Graduate School of Medical Sciences of the UMC Groningen.

The loading efficacies of BCG-CWCs and UVI-DENV into the CS-NPs and BCG-CS-NPs were up to 97.2 and 98.4%, respectively. THP-1 cellular uptake of UVI-DENV present in the DNV was higher than soluble UVI-DENV alone. DNV stimulation of immature dendritic cells (iDCs) resulted in a significantly higher expression of DCs maturation markers (CD80, CD86 and HLA-DR) and induction of various cytokine and chemokine productions than in UVI-DENV-treated iDCs, suggesting a potential use of BCG-CS-NPs as adjuvant and delivery system for dengue vaccines.","[Hunsawong, Taweewun; Thaisomboonsuk, Butsaya; Yoon, In-Kyu] Armed Forces Res Inst Med Sci, Dept Virol, Bangkok 10400, Thailand; [Hunsawong, Taweewun; Ubol, Sukathida] Mahidol Univ, Fac Sci, Dept Microbiol, Bangkok 10400, Thailand; [Sunintaboon, Panya] Mahidol Univ, Fac Sci, Dept Chem, Bangkok 10400, Thailand; [Warit, Saradee] Natl Sci & Technol Dev Agcy, Natl Ctr Genet Engn & Biotechnol, TB Res Lab, Pathum Thani, Thailand; [Jarman, Richard G.] Walter Reed Army Inst Res, Viral Dis Branch, Bethesda, MD USA; [Fernandez, Stefan] US Army Med Mat Dev Act, Ft Detrick, MD USA","Hunsawong, T (reprint author), Armed Forces Res Inst Med Sci, Dept Virol, Bangkok 10400, Thailand.",sukathida.ubo@mahidol.ac.th; stefan.fernandez.mil@mail.mil,,,Military Infectious Disease Research Program (MIDRP) [S0453_14_AF],"This work was funded by the Military Infectious Disease Research Program (MIDRP) grant S0453_14_AF.

We analyse long-term cryptosporidiosis patterns across Australia (2001-2012) and review published Australian studies and jurisdictional health bulletins to identify high risk populations and potential risk factors for disease. Using national data on reported cryptosporidiosis, the average annual rate of reported illness was 12.8 cases per 100 000 population, with cycles of high and low reporting years. Reports of illness peak in summer, similar to other infectious gastrointestinal diseases. States with high livestock densities like New South Wales and Queensland also record a spring peak in illnesses. Children aged less than four years have the highest rates of disease, along with adult females. Rates of reported cryptosporidiosis are highest in the warmer, remote regions and in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander populations. Our review of 34 published studies and seven health department reports on cryptosporidiosis in Australia highlights a lack of long term, non-outbreak studies in these regions and populations, with an emphasis on outbreaks and risk factors in urban areas. The high disease rates in remote, tropical and subtropical areas and in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander populations underscore the need to develop interventions that target the sources of infection, seasonal exposures and risk factors for cryptosporidiosis in these settings. Spatial epidemiology can provide an evidence base to identify priorities for intervention to prevent and control cryptosporidiosis in high risk populations.","[Lal, Aparna; Fearnley, Emily; Glass, Kathryn; Kirk, Martyn] Australian Natl Univ, Res Sch Populat Hlth, Natl Ctr Epidemiol & Populat Hlth, Canberra, ACT, Australia; [Cornish, Lisa Michelle] Australian Natl Univ, Res Sch Populat Hlth, Natl Ctr Geog & Resource Anal Primary Hlth Care G, Canberra, ACT, Australia","Lal, A (reprint author), Australian Natl Univ, Res Sch Populat Hlth, Natl Ctr Epidemiol & Populat Hlth, Canberra, ACT, Australia.",aparna.lal@anu.edu.au,,"lal, aparna/0000-0001-7062-1468; Kirk, Martyn/0000-0001-5432-5984; Glass, Kathryn/0000-0001-5905-1310",Australian National University,"This work was funded by salary from the Australian National University to AL.

This research explores the private household out-of-pocket and opportunity costs incurred to receive free oral cholera vaccine during a mass vaccination campaign in rural Odisha, India. Methods Following a government-driven oral cholera mass vaccination campaign targeting population over one year of age, a questionnaire-based cross-sectional survey was conducted to estimate private household costs among vaccine recipients. The questionnaire captured travel costs as well as time and wage loss for self and accompanying persons. The productivity loss was estimated using three methods: self-reported, government defined minimum daily wages and gross domestic product per capita in Odisha. Findings On average, families were located 282.7 (SD = 254.5) meters from the nearest vaccination booths. Most family members either walked or bicycled to the vaccination sites and spent on average 26.5 minutes on travel and 15.7 minutes on waiting. Depending upon the methodology, the estimated productivity loss due to potential foregone income ranged from $0.15 to $0.29 per dose of cholera vaccine received. The private household cost of receiving oral cholera vaccine constituted 24.6% to 38.0% of overall vaccine delivery costs. Interpretation The private household costs resulting from productivity loss for receiving a free oral cholera vaccine is a substantial proportion of overall vaccine delivery cost and may influence vaccine uptake. Policy makers and program managers need to recognize the importance of private costs and consider how to balance programmatic delivery costs with private household costs to receive vaccines.","[Mogasale, Vittal; Kim, Jong-Hoon; Mogasale, Vijayalaxmi V.; Puri, Mahesh K.; You, Young Ae; Maskery, Brian; Wierzba, Thomas F.; Sah, Binod] IVI, Seoul, South Korea; [Kar, Shantanu K.; Kerketta, Anna S.; Rath, Shyam Bandhu; Khuntia, Hemant K.] RMRC, Bhubaneswar, Orissa, India; [Patnaik, Bikash] DHS, Odisha, India","Mogasale, V (reprint author), IVI, Seoul, South Korea.",vmogasale@ivi.int,"Mogasale, Vittal/H-3156-2019; Mogasale, Vittal/C-7853-2011","Mogasale, Vijayalaxmi V/0000-0002-9564-8760; Mogasale, Vittal/0000-0003-0596-8072",Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation [OPPGH5234]; Government of Korea; Government of Sweden,"This work was funded by a Grant from Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, Grant number-OPPGH5234, Grant name: 'Pilot Introduction of the Modified Killed Whole-Cell Oral Cholera Vaccine in India"".

The main tracks of transmission are known; however, the relative importance of each of the components and the respective environmental risk factors are unclear. We aimed to assess and specify quantitative evidence of environmental risks of leptospirosis transmission. Methods/findings A database of pre-selected studies, with publication dates from 1970 until 2008, was provided by an expert group. The database has been updated until 2015 using a text mining algorithm. Study selection was based on stringent quality criteria. A descriptive data analysis was performed to calculate the medians of the log transformed odds ratios. From a selection of 2723 unique publications containing information on leptospirosis, 428 papers dealing with risk factors were identified. Of these, 53 fulfilled the quality criteria, allowing us to identify trends in different geo-climatic regions. Water associated exposures were, with few exceptions, associated with an increased leptospirosis risk. In resource poor countries, floods and rainfall were of particular importance, whereas recreational water activities were more relevant in developed countries. Rodents were associated with increased leptospirosis risk, but the variation among studies was high, which might be partly explained by differences in exposure definition. Livestock contact was commonly associated with increased risk; however, several studies found no association. The median odds ratios associated with dog and cat contacts were close to unity. Sanitation and behavioural risk factors were almost always strongly associated with leptospirosis, although their impact was rarely investigated in Europe or North America. Conclusion This review confirms the complex environmental transmission pathways of leptospirosis, as previously established. Although, floods appeared to be among the most important drivers on islands and in Asia, the consistent pattern observed for exposure to rodents and behavioural and sanitation related risk factors indicate potential areas for intervention.","[Mwachui, Mwanajaa Abdalla; Crump, Lisa; Zinsstag, Jakob; Hattendorf, Jan] Swiss Trop & Publ Hlth Inst, Dept Epidemiol & Publ Hlth, Basel, Switzerland; [Mwachui, Mwanajaa Abdalla; Crump, Lisa; Zinsstag, Jakob; Hattendorf, Jan] Univ Basel, Basel, Switzerland; [Hartskeerl, Rudy] KIT Biomed Res, Royal Trop Inst KIT, Amsterdam, Netherlands","Mwachui, MA (reprint author), Swiss Trop & Publ Hlth Inst, Dept Epidemiol & Publ Hlth, Basel, Switzerland.",jan.hattendorf@unibas.ch,"Zinsstag, Jakob/A-8317-2008; Hattendorf, Jan/F-5371-2010","Zinsstag, Jakob/0000-0002-8899-6097; Hattendorf, Jan/0000-0002-1176-401X; Crump, Lisa/0000-0002-4406-0238",WHO Department of Food Safety and Zoonoses (FOS),"This study was funded by the WHO Department of Food Safety and Zoonoses (FOS).

Programme impact will be influenced by factors that affect the reduction in the prevalence and intensity of infections following treatment, as well as the subsequent rate of reinfection. To better understand the heterogeneity of programme impact and its underlying reasons, we investigated the influence of contextual factors on reduction in STH infection as part of the national school based deworming (SBD) programme in Kenya. Materials and Methods Data on the prevalence and intensity of infection were collected within the monitoring and evaluation component of the SBD programme at baseline and after delivery of two annual treatment rounds in 153 schools in western Kenya. Using a framework that considers STH epidemiology and transmission dynamics, capacity to deliver treatment, operational feasibility and financial capacity, data were assembled at both school and district (county) levels. Geographic heterogeneity of programme impact was assessed by descriptive and spatial analyses. Factors associated with absolute reductions of Ascaris lumbricoides and hookworm infection prevalence and intensity were identified using mixed effects linear regression modelling adjusting for baseline infection levels. Principal Findings The reduction in prevalence and intensity of A. lumbricoides and hookworms varied significantly by county and within counties by school. Multivariable analysis of factors associated with programme impact showed that absolute A. lumbricoides reductions varied by environmental conditions and access to improved sanitation at schools or within the community. Larger reduction in prevalence and intensity of hookworms were found in schools located within areas with higher community level access to improved sanitation and within counties with higher economic and health service delivery indicator scores. Conclusions The study identifies factors associated with the impact of school-based deworming and in particular highlights how access to water, sanitation and hygiene and environmental conditions influence the impact of deworming programmes.","[Nikolay, Birgit; Cano, Jorge; Pullan, Rachel L.; Brooker, Simon J.] London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, Fac Infect & Trop Dis, London WC1, England; [Mwandawiro, Charles S.; Kihara, Jimmy H.; Okoyo, Collins; Njenga, Sammy M.] Kenya Govt Med Res Ctr, Eastern & Southern Africa Ctr Int Parasite Contro, Nairobi, Kenya; [Mwanje, Mariam T.; Sultani, Hadley; Alusala, Dorcas] Minist Hlth, Neglected Trop Dis Unit, Div Communicable Dis Prevent & Control, Nairobi, Kenya; [Turner, Hugo C.; Anderson, Roy M.] London Ctr Neglected Trop Dis Res, London, England; [Turner, Hugo C.; Anderson, Roy M.] Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Dept Infect Dis Epidemiol, Sch Publ Hlth, Fac Med, London, England; [Teti, Caroline] Evidence Act, Nairobi, Kenya; [Garn, Josh; Freeman, Matthew C.] Emory Univ, Dept Environm Hlth, Rollins Sch Publ Hlth, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA; [Allen, Elizabeth] London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, Dept Med Stat, London WC1, England","Nikolay, B (reprint author), London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, Fac Infect & Trop Dis, London WC1, England.",birgitnikolay@gmail.com,,"Njenga, Sammy/0000-0001-6309-476X; Turner, Hugo/0000-0002-8428-3874",Children's Investment Fund Foundation (CIFF); Wellcome Trust Senior Fellowship in Basic Biomedical Science [098045],"The fieldwork was financially supported by the Children's Investment Fund Foundation (CIFF).

This vaccine was shown to be well attenuated, immunogenic and efficacious in protecting against CHIK virus (CHIKV) challenge of mice and nonhuman primates. To further evaluate its preclinical safety, we compared CHIKV/IRES distribution and viral loads in interferon-alpha/beta receptor-incompetent A129 mice to another CHIK vaccine candidate, 181/clone25, which proved highly immunogenic but mildly reactive in human Phase I/II clinical trials. Compared to wild-type CHIK virus, (wt-CHIKV), both vaccines generated lower viral loads in a wide variety of tissues and organs, including the brain and leg muscle, but CHIKV/IRES exhibited marked restrictions in dissemination and viral loads compared to 181/clone25, and was never found outside the blood, spleen and muscle. Unlike wt-CHIKV, which caused disrupted splenic architecture and hepatic lesions, histopathological lesions were not observed in animals infected with either vaccine strain. To examine the stability of attenuation, both vaccines were passaged 5 times intracranially in infant A129 mice, then assessed for changes in virulence by comparing parental and passaged viruses for footpad swelling, weight stability and survival after subcutaneous infection. Whereas strain 181/clone25 p5 underwent a significant increase in virulence as measured by weight loss (from <10% to >30%) and mortality (from 0 to 100%), CHIKV/IRES underwent no detectible change in any measure of virulence (no significant weight loss and no mortality). These data indicate greater nonclinical safety of the CHIKV/IRES vaccine candidate compared to 181/clone25, further supporting its eligibility for human testing.","[Plante, Kenneth S.] Univ Texas Med Branch, Inst Human Infect & Immun, Sealy Ctr Vaccine Dev, Galveston, TX 77555 USA; Univ Texas Med Branch, Dept Pathol, Galveston, TX 77555 USA","Plante, KS (reprint author), Univ Texas Med Branch, Inst Human Infect & Immun, Sealy Ctr Vaccine Dev, Galveston, TX 77555 USA.",sweaver@utmb.edu,"Weaver, Scott/D-6490-2011","Weaver, Scott/0000-0001-8016-8556; Bergren, Nicholas/0000-0003-4496-447X","National Institutes of Health [AI093491, AI060549]","This research was funded by the National Institutes of Health under grants AI093491 and AI060549.

In 2012 Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) started an intervention in Bergamo province, where many people of Latin American origin (PLAO) are resident. A new model-of-care for CD, initiated by Centre for Tropical Diseases of Sacro Cuore Hospital, Negrar (CTD), the NGO OIKOS and the Bolivian community since 2009 in the same area, was endorsed. Hereby, we aim to describe the prevalence of CD and the treatment management outcomes among PLAO screened from 1st June 2012 to 30th June 2013. Methods Retrospective cohort study using routine program data. Screening sessions were done in Bergamo at OIKOS outpatient service and serological confirmation, staging and treatment for CD was offered at the CTD. MSF provided health education on CD, awareness generation prior to screening days, pre-test and post-test counselling through cultural mediators of Latin American origin. Results Of 1305 PLAO screened, 223(17%) had CD. Among 210 patients eligible for treatment, 102 (49%) were lost-to-follow-up before treatment. The median delay from diagnosis to treatment was 4 months (range 0.7-16.6 months). Among 108 started on treatment, 63(58%) completed treatment, 36(33%) interrupted treatment, (33 for drug side-effects, two for patients decision and one due to pregnancy), 6(6%) were lost-to-follow-up and 3(3%) were on treatment at study censuring. Conclusion In this first study focusing on process of care for CD in Italy, less than 30% of patients completed treatment with drop-outs along the cascade of care. There is an urgent need to involve affected communities and local regional health authorities to take part to this model-of-care, adapting it to the local epidemiology. The Italian health authorities should take steps in advocating for a change in the current paradigm.","[Repetto, Ernestina Carla; Al Rousan, Ahmad; Torrico, Carlota; Ruiz, Rosa; Ledezma, Gabriel; De Maio, Gianfranco; Maccagno, Barbara; Garelli, Silvia] MSF Belgium, Operat Ctr Brussels, Medecins Sans Frontieres, Brussels, Belgium; [Zachariah, Rony; Khogali, Mohammed; Van den Bergh, Rafael] MSF Luxembourg, Dept Med, Medecins Sans Frontieres, Operat Ctr Brussels, Luxembourg, Luxembourg; [Kumar, Ajay] Int Union TB & Lung Dis, South East Asia Reg Off, New Delhi, India; [Angheben, Andrea; Gobbi, Federico] Sacro Cuore Hosp, Ctr Trop Dis, Negrar Verona, Italy; [Angheben, Andrea; Anselmi, Mariella] COHEMI Project, Milan, Italy; [Anselmi, Mariella] Ctr Trop Dis & Community Epidemiol CECOMET, Esmeraldas, Ecuador; [Buoninsegna, Maria Chiara] OIKOS Onlus, Bergamo, Italy; [Egidi, Ada Maristella] MSF Italy, Dept Med, Medecins Sans Frontieres, Operat Ctr Brussels, Rome, Italy","Repetto, EC (reprint author), MSF Belgium, Operat Ctr Brussels, Medecins Sans Frontieres, Brussels, Belgium.",erniesby@gmail.com,"Angheben, Andrea/H-6248-2019; Ucar, Abdullah/P-8329-2017","Van den Bergh, Rafael/0000-0001-6277-8713",,,,26,11,11,2,8,PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE,SAN FRANCISCO,"1160 BATTERY STREET, STE 100, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94111 USA",1935-2735,,,PLOS NEGLECT TROP D,Plos Neglect.

Biting midges of the genus Forcipomyia (Lasiohelea) have been implicated in the transmission of a member of the L. enriettii complex in Australia, but the far larger and more widespread genus Culicoides has not been investigated for the potential to include vectors to date. Methodology/Principal Findings Females from colonies of the midges Culicoides nubeculosus Meigen and C. sonorensis Wirth & Jones and the sand fly Lutzomyia longipalpis Lutz & Nevia (Diptera: Psychodidae) were experimentally infected with two different species of Leishmania, originating from Australia (Leishmania sp. AM-2004) and Brazil (Leishmania enriettii). In addition, the infectivity of L. enriettii infections generated in guinea pigs and golden hamsters for Lu. longipalpis and C. sonorensis was tested by xenodiagnosis. Development of L. enriettii in Lu. longipalpis was relatively poor compared to other Leishmania species in this permissive vector. Culicoides nubeculosus was not susceptible to infection by parasites from the L. enriettii complex. In contrast, C. sonorensis developed late stage infections with colonization of the thoracic midgut and the stomodeal valve. In hamsters, experimental infection with L. enriettii led only to mild symptoms, while in guinea pigs L. enriettii grew aggressively, producing large, ulcerated, tumour-like lesions. A high proportion of C. sonorensis (up to 80%) feeding on the ears and nose of these guinea pigs became infected. Conclusions/Significance We demonstrate that L. enriettii can develop late stage infections in the biting midge Culicoides sonorensis. This midge was found to be susceptible to L. enriettii to a similar degree as Lutzomyia longipalpis, the vector of Leishmania infantum in South America. Our results support the hypothesis that some biting midges could be natural vectors of the L. enriettii complex because of their vector competence, although not Culicoides sonorensis itself, which is not sympatric, and midges should be assessed in the field while searching for vectors of related Leishmania species including L. martiniquensis and ""L. siamensis"".","[Seblova, Veronika; Sadlova, Jovana; Vojtkova, Barbora; Votypka, Jan; Volf, Petr] Charles Univ Prague, Fac Sci, Dept Parasitol, Prague, Czech Republic; [Carpenter, Simon] Pirbright Inst, Vector Borne Viral Dis Programme, Pirbright, Surrey, England; [Bates, Paul Andrew] Univ Lancaster, Sch Hlth & Med, Div Biomed & Life Sci, Lancaster, England","Seblova, V (reprint author), Charles Univ Prague, Fac Sci, Dept Parasitol, Prague, Czech Republic.",vera_vera@seznam.cz,"Votypka, Jan/C-5313-2012; Volf, Petr/C-4300-2012; Sadlova, Jovana/C-1327-2012; Carpenter, Simon/C-2718-2013","Votypka, Jan/0000-0002-0552-9363; Volf, Petr/0000-0003-1790-1123; Sadlova, Jovana/0000-0002-0432-2707; Carpenter, Simon/0000-0001-5775-045X; Bates, Paul/0000-0001-6861-5421","EDENext [FP7-261504]; Biotechnological and Biological Sciences Research Council; Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council [BBS/E/I/00001701, BBS/E/I/00001445]","The study was supported by FP7-261504 EDENext, and the manuscript is cataloged as EDENext345.

While drug development efforts are underway, there are concerns that resistant strains will emerge rapidly. Indeed, antiviral drugs that target even conserved regions in other RNA viruses lose efficacy over time as the virus mutates. Here, we sought to determine if there are regions in the DENV genome that are not only evolutionarily conserved but genetically constrained in their ability to mutate and could hence serve as better antiviral targets. High-throughput sequencing of DENV-1 genome directly from twelve, paired dengue patients' sera and then passaging these sera into the two primary mosquito vectors showed consistent and distinct sequence changes during infection. In particular, two residues in the NS5 protein coding sequence appear to be specifically acquired during infection in Ae. aegypti but not Ae. albopictus. Importantly, we identified a region within the NS3 protein coding sequence that is refractory to mutation during human and mosquito infection. Collectively, these findings provide fresh insights into antiviral targets and could serve as an approach to defining evolutionarily constrained regions for therapeutic targeting in other RNA viruses.","[Sessions, October M.; Kamaraj, Uma Sangumathi; Chow, Angelia; Chong, Yuwen; Ong, Xin Mei; Ooi, Eng Eong] Duke NUS Grad Med Sch, Program Emerging Infect Dis, Singapore, Singapore; [Wilm, Andreas; Choy, Milly M.; Nagarajan, Niranjan] Genome Inst Singapore, Computat & Syst Biol, Singapore, Singapore; [Cook, Alex R.] Natl Univ Singapore, Saw Swee Hock Sch Publ Hlth, Singapore 117548, Singapore; [Cook, Alex R.] Natl Univ Hlth Syst, Singapore, Singapore; [Cook, Alex R.] Natl Univ Singapore, Yale NUS Coll, Singapore 117548, Singapore; [Cook, Alex R.] Duke NUS Grad Med Sch, Program Hlth Serv & Syst Res, Singapore, Singapore","Sessions, OM (reprint author), Duke NUS Grad Med Sch, Program Emerging Infect Dis, Singapore, Singapore.",october.sessions@duke-nus.edu.sg,"Cook, Alex/S-3576-2019; Cook, Alex/B-5941-2011","Wilm, Andreas/0000-0002-7344-3764; Cook, Alex/0000-0002-6271-5832; Ooi, Eng Eong/0000-0002-0520-1544",National Medical Research Council; National Medical Research Council CBRG,"This work was funded by the National Medical Research Council Translational Clinical Research Award (http://www.nmrc.gov.sg/content/nmrc_internet/home/grant/compgrants/tcrinfec.html) awarded to Dr. Ooi and a National Medical Research Council CBRG New Investigators Grant (http://www.nmrc.gov.sg/content/nmrc_internet/home/grant/compgrants/edg1.html) awarded to Dr. Sessions.

There is a paucity of data regarding NTS bacteremia in South Asia, a region with a high incidence of typhoidal bacteremia. We sought to determine clinical predictors and outcomes associated with NTS bacteremia compared with typhoidal bacteremia. Methodology We performed a retrospective age-matched case-control study of patients admitted to the Dhaka Hospital of the International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research, Bangladesh, between February 2009 and March 2013. We compared demographic, clinical, microbiological, and outcome variables of NTS bacteremic patients with age-matched S. Typhi bacteremic patients, and a separate comparison of patients with NTS bacteremia and patients with NTS gastroenteritis. Principal Findings Of 20 patients with NTS bacteremia, 5 died (25% case fatality), compared to none of 60 age-matched cases of S. Typhi bacteremia. In univariate analysis, we found that compared with S. Typhi bacteremia, cases of NTS bacteremia had more severe acute malnutrition (SAM) in children under five years of age, less often presented with a duration of fever >= 5 days, and were more likely to have co-morbidities on admission such as pneumonia and clinical signs of sepsis (p< 0.05 in all cases). In multivariable logistic regression, SAM, clinical sepsis, and pneumonia were independent risk factors for NTS bacteremia compared with S. Typhi bacteremia (p< 0.05 in all cases). Notably, we found marked differences in antibiotic susceptibilities, including NTS strains resistant to antibiotics commonly used for empiric therapy of patients suspected to have typhoid fever. Conclusions/Significance Diarrheal patients with NTS bacteremia more often presented with co-morbidities and had a higher case fatality rate compared to those with typhoidal bacteremia. Clinicians in regions where both typhoid and NTS bacteremia are prevalent need to be vigilant about the possibility of both entities, especially given notable differences in antibiotic susceptibility patterns.","[Shahunja, K.

This intra-host genetic diversity is thought to offer an advantage for arboviruses to adapt as they cycle between two very different host species, but it remains poorly characterized. To track changes in viral intra-host genetic diversity during horizontal transmission, we infected Aedes aegypti mosquitoes by allowing them to feed on DENV2-infected patients. We then performed whole-genome deep-sequencing of human-and matched mosquito-derived DENV samples on the Illumina platform and used a sensitive variant-caller to detect single nucleotide variants (SNVs) within each sample. >90% of SNVs were lost upon transition from human to mosquito, as well as from mosquito abdomen to salivary glands. Levels of viral diversity were maintained, however, by the regeneration of new SNVs at each stage of transmission. We further show that SNVs maintained across transmission stages were transmitted as a unit of two at maximum, suggesting the presence of numerous variant genomes carrying only one or two SNVs each. We also present evidence for differences in selection pressures between human and mosquito hosts, particularly on the structural and NS1 genes. This analysis provides insights into how population drops during transmission shape RNA virus genetic diversity, has direct implications for virus evolution, and illustrates the value of high-coverage, whole-genome next-generation sequencing for understanding viral intra-host genetic diversity.","[Sim, Shuzhen; Aw, Pauline P.

Our aim was to investigate whether asymptomatic intestinal helminth infection alters the clinical signs and symptoms as well as the cell mediated immune responses in patients with active TB. Methodology Consecutive, newly diagnosed TB patients and healthy community controls (CCs) were recruited in North-west Ethiopia. TB-score, body mass index and stool samples were analyzed. Cells from HIV-negative TB patients (HIV-/TB) and from CCs were analyzed for regulatory T-cells (Tregs) and cytokine responses using flow cytometry and ELISPOT, respectively. Results A significantly higher ratio of helminth co-infection was observed in TB patients without HIV (Helm+/HIV-/TB) compared to HIV negative CCs, (40% (121/306) versus 28% (85/306), p = 0.003). Helm+/HIV-/TB patients showed significantly increased IL-5 secreting cells compared to Helm-/HIV-/TB (37 SFU (IQR:13-103) versus 2 SFU (1-50); p = 0.02, n = 30). Likewise, levels of absolute Tregs (9.4 (3.2-16.7) cells/mu l versus 2.4 (1.1-4.0) cells/mu l; p = 0.041) and IL-10 secreting cells (65 SFU (7-196) versus 1 SFU (0-31); p = 0.014) were significantly higher in Helm+/HIV-/TB patients compared to Helm-/HIV-/TB patients. In a multivariate analysis, a lower rate of sputum smear positivity for acid fast bacilli, lower body temperature, and eosinophilia were independently associated with helminth infection in TB patients. Conclusions Asymptomatic helminth infection is associated with increased regulatory T-cell and Th2-type responses and a lower rate of sputum smear positivity. Further studies are warranted to investigate the clinical and immunological impact of helminth infection in TB patients.","[Abate, Ebba] Univ Gondar, Dept Immunol & Mol Biol, Gondar, Ethiopia; [Abate, Ebba; Stendahl, Olle; Schon, Thomas] Linkoping Univ, Dept Med Microbiol, S-58185 Linkoping, Sweden; [Belayneh, Meseret] Univ Addis Ababa, Dept Med Lab Sci, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia; [Idh, Jonna] Vastervik Hosp, Dept Anaesthesia & Intens Care, Vastervik, Sweden; [Diro, Ermias] Univ Gondar, Dept Internal Med, Gondar, Ethiopia; [Elias, Daniel] Univ Southern Denmark, Dept Canc & Inflammat, Odense, Denmark; [Britton, Sven] Karolinska Hosp, Dept Infect Dis, S-10401 Stockholm, Sweden; [Aseffa, Abraham] Armauer Hansen Res Inst, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia; [Schon, Thomas] Kalmar Cty Hosp, Dept Clin Microbiol & Infect Dis, Kalmar, Sweden","Abate, E (reprint author), Univ Gondar, Dept Immunol & Mol Biol, Gondar, Ethiopia.",ebbaabate@yahoo.com,"Aseffa, Abraham/J-3248-2016","Aseffa, Abraham/0000-0002-8028-1150",SAREC/SIDA; EU/EDCTP [JP 10800.006]; Swedish Research Council; Swedish Heart and Lung Foundation (Oscar II Jubilee Foundation); Wallenberg Foundation; Armauer Hansen Research Institute,"This study was supported by grant from SAREC/SIDA, EU/EDCTP(JP 10800.006), the Swedish Research Council, the Swedish Heart and Lung Foundation (Oscar II Jubilee Foundation), the Wallenberg Foundation and the Armauer Hansen Research Institute.

In this paper, we evaluated the geographical distribution of NTDs in coastal Tanzania. Methods and Findings We also assessed the collective (compositional and contextual) factors that currently determine risks to multiple NTDs using a cross sectional survey of 1253 individuals in coastal Tanzania. The results show that the effect size in decreasing order of magnitude for non-binary predictors of NTD risks is as follows: NTD comorbidities > poverty > educational attainment > self-reported household quality of life > ethnicity. The multivariate analysis explained 95% of the variance in the relationship between NTD risks and the theoretically-relevant covariates. Compositional (biosocial and sociocultural) factors explained more variance at the neighbourhood level than at the regional level, whereas contextual factors, such as access to health services and household quality, in districts explained a large proportion of variance at the regional level but individually had modest statistical significance, demonstrating the complex interactions between compositional and contextual factors in generating NTD risks. Conclusions NTD risks were inequitably distributed over geographic space, which has several important policy implications. First, it suggests that localities of high burden of NTDs are likely to diminish within statistical averages at higher (regional or national) levels. Second, it indicates that curative or preventive interventions will become more efficient provided they can be focused on the localities, particularly as populations in these localities are likely to be burdened by several NTDs simultaneously, further increasing the imperative of multi-disease interventions.","[Armah, Frederick Ato] Univ Western Ontario, Dept Geog, Environm Hlth & Hazards Lab, London, ON N6A 5C2, Canada; [Quansah, Reginald] Univ Ghana, Coll Hlth Sci, Sch Publ Hlth, Biol Environm & Occupat Hlth Sci, Legon, Accra, Ghana; [Quansah, Reginald] Univ Ghana, Coll Hlth Sci, Noguchi Mem Inst Med Res, Legon, Accra, Ghana; [Luginaah, Isaac] Univ Western Ontario, Dept Geog, London, ON N6A 5C2, Canada; [Chuenpagdee, Ratana] Mem Univ Newfoundland, Dept Geog, St John, NF, Canada; [Hambati, Herbert] Univ Dar Es Salaam, Dept Geog, Dar Es Salaam, Tanzania; [Campbell, Gwyn] IOWC, Montreal, PQ, Canada","Armah, FA (reprint author), Univ Western Ontario, Dept Geog, Environm Hlth & Hazards Lab, London, ON N6A 5C2, Canada.",yaw121@yahoo.co.uk,"Armah, Frederick Ato/R-3906-2017","Armah, Frederick Ato/0000-0002-9371-5683; Luginaah, Isaac/0000-0001-7858-3048","Major Collaborative Research Initiative (MCRI), Canada","This work was funded by the Major Collaborative Research Initiative (MCRI), Canada.

Among this pathogen's arsenal of virulence factors is the tightly regulated type VI secretion system (T6SS). This system acts as an inverted bacteriophage to inject toxins into competing bacteria and eukaryotic phagocytes. V. cholerae strains responsible for the current 7th pandemic activate their T6SS within the host. We established that T6SS-mediated competition occurs upon T6SS activation in the infant mouse, and that this system is functional under anaerobic conditions. When investigating the intestinal host factors mucins (a glycoprotein component of mucus) and bile for potential regulatory roles in controlling the T6SS, we discovered that once mucins activate the T6SS, bile acids can further modulate T6SS activity. Microbiota modify bile acids to inhibit T6SS-mediated killing of commensal bacteria.

Anthrax is one such zoonosis of concern and is a disease requiring greater public health attention in Nigeria. Here we describe the genetic diversity of Bacillus anthracis in Nigeria and compare it to Chad, Cameroon and a broader global dataset based on the multiple locus variable number tandem repeat (MLVA-25) genetic typing system. Nigerian B. anthracis isolates had identical MLVA genotypes and could only be resolved by measuring highly mutable single nucleotide repeats (SNRs). The Nigerian MLVA genotype was identical or highly genetically similar to those in the neighboring countries, confirming the strains belong to this unique West African lineage. Interestingly, sequence data from a Nigerian isolate shares the anthrose deficient genotypes previously described for strains in this region, which may be associated with vaccine evasion. Strains in this study were isolated over six decades, indicating a high level of temporal strain stability regionally. Ecological niche models were used to predict the geographic distribution of the pathogen for all three countries. We describe a west-east habitat corridor through northern Nigeria extending into Chad and Cameroon. Ecological niche models and genetic results show B. anthracis to be ecologically established in Nigeria.

The majority of clinical presentations seen in patients are ulcers on limbs that can be treated by eight weeks of antibiotic therapy. Nevertheless, scarring and permanent disabilities occur frequently and Buruli ulcer still causes high morbidity. A vaccine against the disease is so far not available but would be of great benefit if used for prophylaxis as well as therapy. In the present study, vesicular stomatitis virus-based RNA replicon particles encoding the M. ulcerans proteins MUL2232 and MUL3720 were generated and the expression of the recombinant antigens characterized in vitro. Immunisation of mice with the recombinant replicon particles elicited antibodies that reacted with the endogenous antigens of M. ulcerans cells. A prime-boost immunization regimen with MUL2232-recombinant replicon particles and recombinant MUL2232 protein induced a strong immune response but only slightly reduced bacterial multiplication in a mouse model of M. ulcerans infection. We conclude that a monovalent vaccine based on the MUL2232 antigen will probably not sufficiently control M. ulcerans infection in humans.","[Bolz, Miriam; Kerber, Sarah; Pluschke, Gerd] Swiss Trop & Publ Hlth Inst, Basel, Switzerland; [Bolz, Miriam; Kerber, Sarah; Pluschke, Gerd] Univ Basel, Basel, Switzerland; [Zimmer, Gert] Inst Virol & Immunol IVI, Mittelhausern, Switzerland","Bolz, M (reprint author), Swiss Trop & Publ Hlth Inst, Basel, Switzerland.",gerd.pluschke@unibas.ch,,"Zimmer, Gert/0000-0002-2708-2507",European Community's Seventh Framework Programme (FP7) [241500],"The work presented here was funded by the European Community's Seventh Framework Programme (FP7 No 241500, Buruli Vac).

A bibliometric analysis was conducted to 1) measure research output from European and African researchers on PRDs, 2) describe collaboration patterns, and 3) assess the citation impact of clinical research funded by EDCTP. Methodology/Principal Findings Disease-specific research publications were identified in Thomson Reuters Web of Science using search terms in titles, abstracts and keywords. Publication data, including citation counts, were extracted for 2003-2011. Analyses including output, share of global papers, normalised citation impact (NCI), and geographical distribution are presented. Data are presented as five-year moving averages. European EDCTP member countries accounted for similar to 33% of global research output in PRDs and sub-Saharan African countries for similar to 10% (2007-2011). Both regions contributed more to the global research output in malaria (43.4% and 22.2%, respectively). The overall number of PRD papers from sub-Saharan Africa increased markedly (>47%) since 2003, particularly for HIV/AIDS (102%) and tuberculosis (TB) (81%), and principally involving Southern and East Africa. For 2007-2011, European and sub-Saharan African research collaboration on PRDs was highly cited compared with the world average (NCI in brackets): HIV/AIDS 1.62 (NCI: 1.16), TB 2.11 (NCI: 1.06), malaria 1.81 (NCI: 1.22), and neglected infectious diseases 1.34 (NCI: 0.97). The NCI of EDCTP-funded papers for 2003-2011 was exceptionally high for HIV/AIDS (3.24), TB (4.08) and HIV/TB co-infection (5.10) compared with global research benchmarks (1.14, 1.05 and 1.35, respectively). Conclusions The volume and citation impact of papers from sub-Saharan Africa has increased since 2003, as has collaborative research between Europe and sub-Saharan Africa. >90% of publications from EDCTP-funded research were published in high-impact journals and are highly cited. These findings corroborate the benefit of collaborative research on PRDs.","[Breugelmans, J.

The study aims to look at the socio-demographic factors, health beliefs, and knowledge about dengue and its association to dengue prevention practices among Orang Asli communities in Peninsular Malaysia. Methods A cross-sectional survey was conducted in 16 randomly selected Orang Asli villages from eight states in Peninsular Malaysia from April 2012 until February 2013. Results A total of 560 Orang Asli were interviewed and 505 completed the survey. Slightly above half of the participants (n = 280, 55.4%) had a total dengue prevention score of 51-100 (of a possible score of 0-100). Multivariate analysis findings showed dengue knowledge, perceived barriers to perform dengue prevention, fogging frequency, and perceived susceptibility to dengue fever as significant factors associated to dengue prevention practices. Participants with a lower dengue knowledge score (score 0-18) were less likely (OR = 0.63, 95% CI = 0.44-0.92 vs. score 19-36, P = 0.015) to practice dengue prevention. Participants with low perceived barriers to prevent dengue (score of 1-5) were more likely (OR = 2.06, 95% CI = 1.21-3.53, vs. score of 6-10, P = 0.008) to practice dengue prevention. Villages that were not fogged (OR = 0.49, 95% CI = 0.24-0.99, P = 0.045) or rarely fogged (OR = 0.40, 95% CI = 0.22-0.75, P = 0.004) had lower dengue prevention practices than villages that were fogged often. Participants with low perceived susceptibility of acquiring dengue (score of 1-5) were less likely (OR = 0.54, 95% CI = 0.33-0.89 vs. score of 6-10, P = 0.018) to practice dengue prevention measures. Conclusion Findings imply that educational and health programmes should focus on enhancing dengue knowledge and perceived susceptibility of acquiring dengue and reducing perceived barriers to performing dengue prevention practices among the Orang Asli. More outreach on mosquito control campaigns should be carried out especially in villages where mosquito fogging is frequent.","[Chandren, Josephine Rebecca; Wong, Li Ping] Univ Malaya, Fac Med, Dept Social & Prevent Med, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia; [Wong, Li Ping] Univ Malaya, Julius Ctr Univ Malaya, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia; [AbuBakar, Sazaly] Univ Malaya, Fac Med, Dept Med Microbiol, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia; [AbuBakar, Sazaly] Univ Malaya, Trop Infect Dis Res & Educ Ctr, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia","Chandren, JR (reprint author), Univ Malaya, Fac Med, Dept Social & Prevent Med, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.",wonglp@ummc.edu.my,"Wong, Li Ping/C-1049-2010; abubakar, sazaly/B-3957-2010","Wong, Li Ping/0000-0002-0107-0532; abubakar, sazaly/0000-0002-9267-1420",Long Research Grant Scheme [LR001-2001E],"This work was funded by the Long Research Grant Scheme (LR001-2001E).

An effective vaccine would be a major step towards eliminating the disease. Studies suggest that T follicular helper (Tfh) cells provide help to B cells to generate the long-term humoral immunity, which would be a crucial component of successful vaccines. Thus, understanding the biological characteristics of Tfh cells in patients with schistosomiasis, which has never been explored, is essential for vaccine design. Methodology/Principal Findings In this study, we investigated the biological characteristics of peripheral memory Tfh cells in schistosomiasis patients by flow cytometry. Our data showed that the frequencies of total and activated peripheral memory Tfh cells in patients were significantly increased during Schistosoma japonicum infection. Moreover, Tfh2 cells, which were reported to be a specific subpopulation to facilitate the generation of protective antibodies, were increased more greatly than other subpopulations of total peripheral memory Tfh cells in patients with schistosomiasis japonica. More importantly, our result showed significant correlations of the percentage of Tfh2 cells with both the frequency of plasma cells and the level of IgG antibody. In addition, our results showed that the percentage of T follicular regulatory (Tfr) cells was also increased in patients with schistosomiasis. Conclusions/Significance Our report is the first characterization of peripheral memory Tfh cells in schistosomasis patients, which not only provides potential targets to improve immune response to vaccination, but also is important for the development of vaccination strategies to control schistosomiasis.","[Chen, Xiaojun; Li, Wei; Zhang, Yang; Song, Xian; Xu, Lei; Xu, Zhipeng; Zhou, Sha; Zhu, Jifeng; Jin, Xin; Liu, Feng; Su, Chuan] Nanjing Med Univ, Jiangsu Key Lab Pathogen Biol, Dept Pathogen Biol & Immunol, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Chen, Gengxin] Chizhou Stn Schistosomiasis Prevent & Control, Chizhou, Anhui, Peoples R China","Chen, XJ (reprint author), Nanjing Med Univ, Jiangsu Key Lab Pathogen Biol, Dept Pathogen Biol & Immunol, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",chuansu@njmu.edu.cn,"xu, zhipeng/M-7708-2019","xu, zhipeng/0000-0002-8853-5303","National Natural Science Foundation of China [81430052, 81271861]; Jiangsu Province [12KJA310001, 14KJB310003]; Priority Academic Program Development of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions (PAPD); Nanjing Medical University [2013NJMU001]","This work was supported by the grants from the National Natural Science Foundation of China ( No. 81430052 and No. 81271861) and by the grant from Jiangsu Province (12KJA310001) to Chuan Su.

This strategy is however challenged by the existence of undetected reservoirs of parasites that contribute to the maintenance of transmission. In this study, performed in the Boffa disease focus of Guinea, we evaluated the value of adding vector control to medical surveys and measured its impact on disease burden. Methods The focus was divided into two parts (screen and treat in the western part; screen and treat plus vector control in the eastern part) separated by the Rio Pongo river. Population census and baseline entomological data were collected from the entire focus at the beginning of the study and insecticide impregnated targets were deployed on the eastern bank only. Medical surveys were performed in both areas in 2012 and 2013. Findings In the vector control area, there was an 80% decrease in tsetse density, resulting in a significant decrease of human tsetse contacts, and a decrease of disease prevalence (from 0.3% to 0.1%; p=0.01), and an almost nil incidence of new infections (<0.1%). In contrast, incidence was 10 times higher in the area without vector control (>1%, p<0.0001) with a disease prevalence increasing slightly (from 0.5 to 0.7%, p=0.34). Interpretation Combining medical and vector control was decisive in reducing T. b. gambiense transmission and in speeding up progress towards elimination. Similar strategies could be applied in other foci.","[Courtin, Fabrice; Peylhard, Moana; Solano, Philippe; Jamonneau, Vincent] IRD, UMR IRD CIRAD INTERTRYP 177, Bobo Dioulasso, Burkina Faso; [Camara, Mamadou; Kagbadouno, Moise; Camara, Oumou; Traore, Ibrahima S.; Leno, Mamadou] Minist Sante, PNLTHA, Conakry, Guinea; [Rayaisse, Jean-Baptiste; Dama, Emilie; Somda, Martin B.] CIRDES URBIO, Bobo Dioulasso, Burkina Faso; [Rouamba, Jeremi] Ctr MURAZ, Bobo Dioulasso, Burkina Faso; [Lehane, Mike J.; Torr, Steve J.] Univ Liverpool, Liverpool Sch Trop Med, Liverpool L3 5QA, Merseyside, England; [Bucheton, Bruno] IRD, PNLTHA Minist Sante, UMR IRD CIRAD INTERTRYP 177, Conakry, Guinea","Courtin, F (reprint author), IRD, UMR IRD CIRAD INTERTRYP 177, CIRDES 01 BP 454, Bobo Dioulasso, Burkina Faso.",Mike.Lehane@lstmed.ac.uk,"Jamonneau, Vincent/K-1124-2016; solano, philippe/B-2328-2010; Torr, Stephen/N-7161-2016","Jamonneau, Vincent/0000-0001-8427-0769; solano, philippe/0000-0002-4351-3506; Torr, Stephen/0000-0001-9550-4030",Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation [1017770]; World Health Organisation,"The work was supported by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation (grant number 1017770) and by the World Health Organisation.

Conventional vector control methods have been unable to curb the transmission of the disease. We have previously reported a novel method of vector control using a tetracycline repressible self-limiting strain of Ae. aegypti OX513A which has achieved > 90% suppression of wild populations. Methodology/Principal Findings We investigated the impact of tetracycline and its analogues on the phenotype of OX513A from the perspective of possible routes and levels of environmental exposure. We determined the minimum concentration of tetracycline and its analogues that will allow an increased survivorship and found these to be greater than the maximum concentration of tetracyclines found in known Ae. aegypti breeding sites and their surrounding areas. Furthermore, we determined that OX513A parents fed tetracycline are unable to pre-load their progeny with sufficient antidote to increase their survivorship. Finally, we studied the changes in concentration of tetracycline in the mass production rearing water of OX513A and the developing insect. Conclusion/Significance Together, these studies demonstrate that potential routes of exposure of OX513A individuals to tetracycline and its analogues in the environment are not expected to increase the survivorship of OX513A.","[Curtis, Zoe; Matzen, Kelly; Oviedo, Marco Neira; Nimmo, Derric; Gray, Pamela; Winskill, Peter; Warner, Simon; Alphey, Luke; Beech, Camilla] Oxitec Ltd, Abingdon, Oxon, England; [Curtis, Zoe; Winskill, Peter] Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, London, England; [Locatelli, Marco A.

Methodology and Principal Findings In pursuance of deciphering the role of CLrP in SAG resistance, gene was cloned, overexpressed in E. coli system and thereafter antibody was raised. The expression profile of CLrP and was found to be over-expressed in SAG resistant clinical isolates of L. donovani as compared to SAG sensitive ones when investigated by real-time PCR and western blotting. CLrP has been characterized through bioinformatics, immunoblotting and immunolocalization analysis, which reveals its post-translational modification along with its dual existence in the nucleus as well as in the membrane of the parasite. Further investigation using a ChIP assay confirmed its DNA binding potential. Over-expression of CLrP in sensitive isolate of L. donovani significantly decreased its responsiveness to SAG (SbV and SbIII) and a shift towards the resistant mode was observed. Further, a significant increase in its infectivity in murine macrophages has been observed. Conclusion/Significance The study reports the differential expression of CLrP in SAG sensitive and resistant isolates of L. donovani. Functional intricacy of CLrP increases with dual localization, glycosylation and DNA binding potential of the protein. Further over-expressing CLrP in sensitive isolateof L. donovani shows significantly decreased sensitivity towards SAG and increased infectivity as well, thus assisting the parasite in securing a safe niche. Results indicates the possible contribution of CLrP to antimonial resistance in L. donovani by assisting the parasite growth in the macrophages.","[Das, Sanchita; Tandon, Rati; Yadav, Narendra Kumar; Dube, Anuradha] CSIR Cent Drug Res Inst, Div Parasitol, Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh, India; [Shah, Priyanka; Sahasrabuddhe, Amogh A.; Siddiqi, Mohammad Imran] CSIR Cent Drug Res Inst, Mol & Struct Biol, Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh, India; [Sundar, Shyam] Banaras Hindu Univ, Inst Med Sci, Dept Med, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India","Das, S (reprint author), CSIR Cent Drug Res Inst, Div Parasitol, Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh, India.",anuradha_dube@hotmail.com,"Filho, Fernando/Q-8021-2018",,"University Grants Commission; Council of Scientific and Industrial Research; Indian Council of Medical Research, New Delhi, India; CSIR-CDRI's Supra-institutional network project [SIP-0026]; CSIR_CDRI's Biological Sciences Cluster Project [BSC-0114]","This work was supported by CSIR-CDRI's Supra-institutional network project (SIP-0026) and CSIR_CDRI's Biological Sciences Cluster Project (BSC-0114).

The objective of this study was to identify the risk factors associated with death among adult patients with VL from an urban endemic area of Brazil. Methodology A prospective cohort study included 134 adult patients with VL admitted to the University Hospital of the Federal University of Mato Grosso do Sul between August 2011 and August 2013. Principal Findings Patients ranged from 18 to 93 years old, with a mean age of 43.6 (+/- 15.7%). Of these patients, 36.6% were co-infected with HIV/AIDS, and the mortality rate was 21.6%. In a multivariate analysis, the risk factors associated with death were secondary bacterial infection (42.86, 5.05-363.85), relapse (12.17, 2.06-71.99), edema (7.74, 1.33-45.05) and HIV/AIDS co-infection (7.33, 1.22-43.98). Conclusions/Significance VL has a high mortality rate in adults from endemic urban areas, especially when coinciding with high rates of HIV/AIDS co-infection.","[Druzian, Angelita F.] Univ Fed Mato Grosso do Sul, Univ Hosp, Campo Grande, MS, Brazil; [Druzian, Angelita F.; Higa, Minoru G., Jr.; Dorval, Maria Elizabeth C.; Paniago, Anamaria M.

NC is a severe disease still affecting the population in developing countries of Latin America, Asia, and Africa. While great improvements have been made on NC diagnosis, treatment, and prevention, the management of patients affected by extraparenchymal parasites remains a challenge. The development of a T. solium NC experimental model in pigs that will allow the evaluation of new therapeutic alternatives is herein presented. Activated oncospheres (either 500 or 1000) were surgically implanted in the cerebral subarachnoid space of piglets. The clinical status and the level of serum antibodies in the animals were evaluated for a 4-month period after implantation. The animals were sacrificed, cysticerci were counted during necropsy, and both the macroscopic and microscopic characteristics of cysts were described. Based on the number of established cysticerci, infection efficiency ranged from 3.6% (1000 oncospheres) to 5.4% (500 oncospheres). Most parasites were caseous or calcified (38/63, 60.3%) and were surrounded by an exacerbated inflammatory response with lymphocyte infiltration and increased inflammatory markers. The infection elicited specific antibodies but no neurological signs. This novel experimental model of NC provides a useful tool to evaluate new cysticidal and anti-inflammatory approaches and it should improve the management of severe NC patients, refractory to the current treatments.","[Fleury, Agnes] Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Unidad Perifer Inst Invest Biomed, Inst Nacl Neurol & Neurocirug, Mexico City 04510, DF, Mexico; [Fleury, Agnes; Villeda Hernandez, Juana] Secretaria de Salud, Inst Nacl Neurol & Neurocirug, Mexico City, DF, Mexico; [Trejo, Armando; Cisneros, Humberto; Villalobos, Nelly; de Aluja, Aline S.] Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Fac Med Vet & Zootecnia, Mexico City 04510, DF, Mexico; [Garcia-Navarrete, Roberto] Secretaria de Salud, Inst Nacl Pediat, Mexico City, DF, Mexico; [Garcia-Navarrete, Roberto] Secretaria Marina SEMAR, Hosp Gen Naval Alta Especialidad, Mexico City, DF, Mexico; [Hernandez, Marisela; Bobes, Raul J.; Sciutto, Edda; Fragoso, Gladis] Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Dept Inmunol, Inst Invest Biomed, Mexico City 04510, DF, Mexico; [Hernandez, Beatriz] Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Fac Med, Mexico City 04510, DF, Mexico; [Rosas, Gabriela] Univ Autonoma Estado Morelos, Fac Med, Cuernavaca, Morelos, Mexico","Fleury, A (reprint author), Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Unidad Perifer Inst Invest Biomed, Inst Nacl Neurol & Neurocirug, Mexico City 04510, DF, Mexico.",afleury@biomedicas.unam.mx,,"Garcia-Navarrete Salinas, Roberto Antonio/0000-0002-5979-8411",Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONACYT) [106154],"This work was funded by Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONACYT): grant 106154 to AF.

One of the major problems with rabies is that the infected individuals most often do not develop virus neutralizing antibodies (VNA). In this study we have investigated the host immune response to RABV infection in dogs, using a live-attenuated (TriGAS) or a wild-type (wt) (DRV-NG11) RABV isolated from a rabid dog. Methodology/Principal Findings The experimental infection of dogs with TriGAS induced high levels of VNA in the serum, whereas wt RABV infection did not. Dogs infected with TriGAS developed antibodies against the virus including its glycoprotein, whereas dogs infected with DRV-NG11 only developed rabies antibodies that are presumably specific for the nucleoprotein, (N) and not the glycoprotein (G). We show that infection with TriGAS induces early activation of B cells in the draining lymph nodes and persistent activation of DCs and B cells in the blood. On the other hand, infection with DRV-NG11 fails to induce the activation of DCs and B cells and further reduces CD4 T cell production. Further, we show that intrathecal ( IT) immunization of TriGAS not only induced high levels of VNA in the serum but also in the CSF while intramuscular (IM) immunization of TriGAS induced VNA only in the serum. In addition, high levels of total protein and WBC were detected in the CSF of IT immunized dogs, indicating the transient enhancement of blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability, which is relevant to the passage of immune effectors from periphery into the CNS. Conclusions/Significance IM infection of dogs with TriGAS induced the production of serum VNA whereas, IT immunization of TriGAS in dogs induces high levels of VNA in the periphery as well as in the CSF and transiently enhances BBB permeability. In contrast, infection with wt DRV-NG11 resulted in the production of RABV-reactive antibodies but VNA and antibodies specific for G were absent. As a consequence, all of the dogs infected with wt DRV-NG11 succumbed to rabies. Thus the failure to activate protective immunity is one of the important features of RABV pathogenesis in dogs.","[Gnanadurai, Clement W.; Yang, Yang; Huang, Ying; Li, Zhenguang; Leyson, Christina M.; Fu, Zhen F.] Univ Georgia, Coll Vet Med, Dept Pathol, Athens, GA 30602 USA; [Yang, Yang; Fu, Zhen F.] Huazhong Agr Univ, Coll Vet Med, State Key Lab Agr Microbiol, Wuhan, Peoples R China; [Cooper, Tanya L.; Harvey, Stephen B.] Univ Georgia, Coll Vet Med, Dept Populat Hlth, Athens, GA USA; [Platt, Simon R.] Univ Georgia, Coll Vet Med, Small Med & Surg, Athens, GA USA; [Hooper, Douglas C.; Faber, Milosz] Thomas Jefferson Univ, Dept Canc Biol & Neurol Surg, Philadelphia, PA 19107 USA","Gnanadurai, CW (reprint author), Univ Georgia, Coll Vet Med, Dept Pathol, Athens, GA 30602 USA.",zhenfu@uga.edu,,"Hooper, Douglas/0000-0002-8578-5104; yang, yang/0000-0003-1731-5837; Platt, Simon/0000-0002-7818-1011","National Institute of Health (NIH), USA [AI-051560, AI-093369]","This work was supported by grants AI-051560 and AI-093369, National Institute of Health (NIH), USA.

Prostanoids are regulators of homeostasis and inflammation and are produced mainly by myeloid cells, being cyclooxygenases, COX-1 and COX-2, the key enzymes in their biosynthesis from arachidonic acid (AA). Here, we have investigated the expression of enzymes involved in AA metabolism during T. cruzi infection. Our results show an increase in the expression of several of these enzymes in acute T. cruzi infected heart. Interestingly, COX-2 was expressed by CD68(+) myeloid heart-infiltrating cells. In addition, infiltrating myeloid CD11b(+)Ly6G(-) cells purified from infected heart tissue express COX-2 and produce prostaglandin E-2 (PGE(2)) ex vivo. T. cruzi infections in COX-2 or PGE(2-)dependent prostaglandin receptor EP-2 deficient mice indicate that both, COX-2 and EP-2 signaling contribute significantly to the heart leukocyte infiltration and to the release of chemokines and inflammatory cytokines in the heart of T. cruzi infected mice.

To improve the current knowledge on L. major evolution and population dynamics, we performed multi-locus microsatellite typing of human isolates from Tunisian governorates where the disease is endemic (Gafsa, Kairouan and Sidi Bouzid governorates) and collected during two periods: 1991-1992 and 2008-2012. Analysis (F-statistics and Bayesian model-based approach) of the genotyping results of isolates collected in Sidi Bouzid in 1991-1992 and 2008-2012 shows that, over two decades, in the same area, Leishmania parasites evolved by generating genetically differentiated populations. The genetic patterns of 2008-2012 isolates from the three governorates indicate that L. major populations did not spread gradually from the south to the center of Tunisia, according to a geographical gradient, suggesting that human activities might be the source of the disease expansion. The genotype analysis also suggests previous (Bayesian model-based approach) and current (F-statistics) flows of genotypes between governorates and districts. Human activities as well as reservoir dynamics and the effects of environmental changes could explain how the disease progresses. This study provides new insights into the evolution and spread of L. major in Tunisia that might improve our understanding of the parasite flow between geographically and temporally distinct populations.","[Harrabi, Myriam; Bettaieb, Jihene; Ghawar, Wissem; Toumi, Amine; Zaatour, Amor; Yazidi, Rihab; Chaabane, Sana; Chalghaf, Bilel; Ben Salah, Afif] Inst Pasteur, Tunis, Tunisia; [Harrabi, Myriam] Univ Carthage, Fac Sci Bizerte, Tunis, Tunisia; [Hide, Mallorie; Banuls, Anne-Laure] Univ Montpellier I, Ctr IRD, UMR MIVEGEC IRD 224 CNRS5290, Montpellier, France; [Hide, Mallorie; Banuls, Anne-Laure] Univ Montpellier 2, Ctr IRD, UMR MIVEGEC IRD 224 CNRS5290, Montpellier, France","Harrabi, M (reprint author), Inst Pasteur, Tunis, Tunisia.",myriamharrabi@yahoo.fr,,"Banuls, Anne-Laure/0000-0002-2106-8667",US-NIAID-NIH [1P50AI074178-01],"The present study is part of a research project funded by US-NIAID-NIH, Grant number 1P50AI074178-01.

The key to maintaining the risk of transmission of Trypanosoma cruzi at lowest levels is to sustain surveillance throughout endemic areas. Guatemala, El Salvador, and Honduras integrated community-based vector surveillance into local health systems. Community participation was effective in detection of the vector, but some health services had difficulty sustaining their response to reports of vectors from the population. To date, no research has investigated how best to maintain and reinforce health service responsiveness, especially in resource-limited settings. Methodology/Principal Findings We reviewed surveillance and response records of 12 health centers in Guatemala, El Salvador, and Honduras from 2008 to 2012 and analyzed the data in relation to the volume of reports of vector infestation, local geography, demography, human resources, managerial approach, and results of interviews with health workers. Health service responsiveness was defined as the percentage of households that reported vector infestation for which the local health service provided indoor residual spraying of insecticide or educational advice. Eight potential determinants of responsiveness were evaluated by linear and mixed-effects multi-linear regression. Health service responsiveness (overall 77.4%) was significantly associated with quarterly monitoring by departmental health offices. Other potential determinants of responsiveness were not found to be significant, partly because of short-and long-term strategies, such as temporary adjustments in manpower and redistribution of tasks among local participants in the effort. Conclusions/Significance Consistent monitoring within the local health system contributes to sustainability of health service responsiveness in community-based vector surveillance of Chagas disease. Even with limited resources, countries can improve health service responsiveness with thoughtful strategies and management practices in the local health systems.","[Hashimoto, Ken] Japan Int Cooperat Agcy, Chagas Dis Control Project, Tegucigalpa, Honduras; [Zuniga, Concepcion] Minist Hlth, Natl Chagas Dis Control Program, Directorate Hlth Promot, Tegucigalpa, Honduras; [Romero, Eduardo] Minist Hlth, Directorate Environm Hlth, Natl Vector Borne Dis Control Unit, San Salvador, El Salvador; [Morales, Zoraida] Minist Hlth, Dept Regulat Healthcare Programs, Natl Vector Borne Dis Control Program, Guatemala City, Guatemala; [Maguire, James H.] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Brigham & Womens Hosp, Boston, MA USA","Hashimoto, K (reprint author), Harvard TH Chan Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Global Hlth & Populat, Boston, MA 02115 USA.",hashimok@gmail.com,,,Ministry of Health of Guatemala; Ministry of Health of Honduras; Japan International Cooperation Agency; Ministry of Health of El Salvador,"The Ministries of Health of Guatemala, El Salvador, and Honduras; and Japan International Cooperation Agency funded data collection, but had no role in the study design, data analysis, decision to publish, or preparation of the manuscript.",,23,7,7,0,8,PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE,SAN FRANCISCO,"1160 BATTERY STREET, STE 100, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94111 USA",1935-2735,,,PLOS NEGLECT TROP D,Plos Neglect.

Despite the significant effort extended to vaccine trials using ETEC colonization factors, these approaches have generally not been especially effective in mediating cross-protective immunity. We used quantitative proteomics to identify 24 proteins that differed in abundance in membrane protein preparations derived from wild-type vs. a type II secretion system mutant of ETEC. We expressed and purified a subset of these proteins and identified nine antigens that generated significant immune responses in mice. Sera from mice immunized with either the MltA-interacting protein MipA, the periplasmic chaperone seventeen kilodalton protein, Skp, or a long-chain fatty acid outer membrane transporter, ETEC_2479, reduced the adherence of multiple ETEC strains differing in colonization factor expression to human intestinal epithelial cells. In intranasal challenge assays of mice, immunization with ETEC_ 2479 protected 88% of mice from an otherwise lethal challenge with ETEC H10407. Immunization with either Skp or MipA provided an intermediate degree of protection, 68 and 64%, respectively. Protection was significantly correlated with the induction of a secretory immunoglobulin A response. This study has identified several proteins that are conserved among heterologous ETEC strains and may thus potentially improve cross- protective efficacy if incorporated into future vaccine designs.","[Kumar, Amit; Hays, Mike; Miesner, Tracy; Hardwidge, Philip R.] Kansas State Univ, Coll Vet Med, Manhattan, KS 66506 USA; [Lim, Francis; Foster, Leonard J.] Univ British Columbia, Dept Biochem & Mol Biol, Vancouver, BC V5Z 1M9, Canada; [Lim, Francis; Foster, Leonard J.] Univ British Columbia, Ctr Highthroughput Biol, Vancouver, BC V5Z 1M9, Canada; [Zhou, Mingxu; Zhu, Guoqiang] Yangzhou Univ, Coll Vet Med, Yangzhou, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Zhou, Mingxu; Zhu, Guoqiang] Jiangsu Coinnovat Ctr Important Anim Infect Dis &, Yangzhou, Jiangsu, Peoples R China","Kumar, A (reprint author), Kansas State Univ, Coll Vet Med, Manhattan, KS 66506 USA.",hardwidg@gmail.com,,,National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases of National Institutes of Health [AI092266],"This work was supported by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases of the National Institutes of Health under Award Number AI092266 to PRH.

Large community-randomized trials offer an opportunity to actually compare forecasting methods in a masked fashion. Methods The Program for the Rapid Elimination of Trachoma trials estimated longitudinal prevalence of ocular chlamydial infection from 24 communities treated annually with mass azithromycin. Given antibiotic coverage and biannual assessments from baseline through 30 months, forecasts of the prevalence of infection in each of the 24 communities at 36 months were made by three methods: the sum of 15 experts' opinion, statistical regression of the square-root-transformed prevalence, and a stochastic hidden Markov model of infection transmission (Susceptible-Infectious-Susceptible, or SIS model). All forecasters were masked to the 36-month results and to the other forecasts. Forecasts of the 24 communities were scored by the likelihood of the observed results and compared using Wilcoxon's signed-rank statistic. Findings Regression and SIS hidden Markov models had significantly better likelihood than community expert opinion (p = 0.004 and p = 0.01, respectively). All forecasts scored better when perturbed to decrease Fisher's information. Each individual expert's forecast was poorer than the sum of experts. Interpretation Regression and SIS models performed significantly better than expert opinion, although all forecasts were overly confident. Further model refinements may score better, although would need to be tested and compared in new masked studies. Construction of guidelines that rely on forecasting future prevalence could consider use of mathematical and statistical models.","[Liu, Fengchen; Porco, Travis C.; Keenan, Jeremy D.; Lietman, Thomas M.] Univ Calif San Francisco, Francis I Proctor Fdn, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; [Porco, Travis C.; Keenan, Jeremy D.; Lietman, Thomas M.] Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Ophthalmol, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; [Porco, Travis C.; Lietman, Thomas M.] Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Epidemiol & Biostat, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; [Amza, Abdou; Kadri, Boubacar; Nassirou, Baido] Univ Abdou Moumouni Niamey, Programme Natl Sante Oculaire, Programme FSS, Niamey, Niger; [West, Sheila K.] Johns Hopkins Univ, Wilmer Eye Inst, Dana Ctr Prevent Ophthalmol, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA; [Bailey, Robin L.] London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, Dept Infect & Trop Dis, Clin Res Unit, London WC1, England; [Solomon, Anthony W.] World Hlth Org, Dept Control Neglected Trop Dis, Geneva, Switzerland; [Emerson, Paul M.] Int Trachoma Initiat, Atlanta, GA USA; [Gambhir, Manoj] Monash Univ, Dept Epidemiol & Prevent Med, Melbourne, Australia","Liu, FC (reprint author), Univ Calif San Francisco, Francis I Proctor Fdn, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA.",tom.lietman@ucsf.edu,,"Solomon, Anthony/0000-0001-7101-6649; Gambhir, Manoj/0000-0002-4831-6261; Emerson, Paul/0000-0002-6478-8816",Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation [48027]; National Institute of General Medical Sciences at the National Institutes of Health [U01GM08778],"This project was supported by Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation (grant number: 48027, grant recipient: TML, www.gatesfoundation.org), and a Models of Infectious Disease Agent Study grant (grant number: U01GM08778, grant recipient: TCP, www.nigms.nih.gov/Research/SpecificAreas/MIDAS) from the National Institute of General Medical Sciences at the National Institutes of Health.

Schistosoma japonicum, a zoonotic parasite with a wide range of mammalian hosts, is one of the major pathogens of this disease. Although numerous studies on schistosomiasis japonica have been performed using laboratory animal models, systematic comparative analysis of whole-genome expression profiles in parasites from different laboratory animals and nature mammalian hosts is lacking to date. Methodology/Principal Findings Adult schistosomes were obtained from laboratory animals BALB/c mice, C57BL/6 mice, New Zealand white rabbits and the natural host, water buffaloes. The gene expression profiles of schistosomes from these animals were obtained and compared by genome-wide oligonucleotide microarray analysis. The results revealed that the gene expression profiles of schistosomes from different laboratory animals and buffaloes were highly consistent (r>0.98) genome-wide. Meanwhile, a total of 450 genes were identified to be differentially expressed in schistosomes which can be clustered into six groups. Pathway analysis revealed that these genes were mainly involved in multiple signal transduction pathways, amino acid, energy, nucleotide and lipid metabolism. We also identified a group of 1,540 abundantly and stably expressed gene products in adult worms, including a panel of 179 Schistosoma-or Platyhelminthes-specific genes that may be essential for parasitism and may be regarded as novel potential anti-parasite intervention targets for future research. Conclusions/Significance This study provides a comprehensive database of gene expression profiles of schistosomes derived from different laboratory animals and water buffaloes. An expanded number of genes potentially affecting the development of schistosomes in different animals were identified. These findings lay the foundation for schistosomiasis research in different laboratory animals and natural hosts at the transcriptional level and provide a valuable resource for screening anti-schistosomal intervention targets.","[Liu, Shuai; Zhou, Xiaosu; Piao, Xianyu; Wu, Chuang; Hou, Nan; Chen, Qijun] Chinese Acad Med Sci, Inst Pathogen Biol, MOH Key Lab Syst Biol Pathogens, Beijing 100730, Peoples R China; [Liu, Shuai; Zhou, Xiaosu; Piao, Xianyu; Wu, Chuang; Hou, Nan; Chen, Qijun] Peking Union Med Coll, Beijing 100021, Peoples R China; [Chen, Qijun] Jilin Univ, Key Lab Zoonosis, Changchun 130023, Peoples R China","Liu, S (reprint author), Chinese Acad Med Sci, Inst Pathogen Biol, MOH Key Lab Syst Biol Pathogens, Beijing 100730, Peoples R China.",qijun.chen@ipbcams.ac.cn,,,National Natural Science Foundation of China [81270026]; National S & T Major Program [2012ZX10004-220]; Special Fund for Health Research in Public Interest [201202019]; Program for Changjiang Scholars and Innovative Research Team in University [IRT13007],"This study was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (#81270026), the National S & T Major Program (Grant No. 2012ZX10004-220), the Special Fund for Health Research in the Public Interest (Grant No 201202019), and the Program for Changjiang Scholars and Innovative Research Team in University (IRT13007).

Therefore, we hypothesized that the presence of viral co-infections and associated immunological changes will have a clinical impact on leprosy outcomes. The aim of our study was to determine the clinical impact of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), human T cell lymphotrophic virus type 1 (HTLV-1), hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) co-infection on the development of reactions, neuritis, neuropathy and relapses. Methodology/Principal Findings Cohort study in 245 leprosy subjects from Bahia, Brazil. Patients were followed from the time of diagnosis until at least the end of multidrug therapy. Viral co-infection was detected in 36 out of the 245 patients (14.7%). Specific co-infection rates were 10.6% for HBV, 2.9% for HIV, 2.5% for HTLV-1 and 0.8% for HCV. All four groups of co-infected patients had higher rates of neuritis and nerve function impairment compared to non co-infected leprosy subjects. The relapse rate was also higher in the co-infected group (8.3%) versus patients without co-infection (1.9%); relative risk 4.37, 95% confidence interval 1.02-18.74. Conclusions/Significance Leprosy patients should be screened for HBV, HCV, HIV and HTLV-1 co-infections. Besides contributing to better health care, this measure will facilitate the early detection of severe complications through targeting of higher risk patients.","[Machado, Paulo R.

Both yaws and trachoma-which is earmarked for elimination by 2020 using a strategy that includes mass treatment with 20mg/kg azithromycin-are endemic in the Pacific, raising the possibility of an integrated approach to disease control. Community mass treatment with azithromycin for trachoma elimination was conducted in the Solomon Islands in 2014. Methods We conducted a study to assess the impact of mass treatment with 20mg/kg azithromycin on yaws. We examined children aged 5-14 years and took blood and lesion samples for yaws diagnosis. Results We recruited 897 children, 6 months after mass treatment. There were no cases of active yaws. Serological evidence of current infection was found in 3.6% (95% CI=2.5-5.0%). This differed significantly between individuals who had and had not received azithromycin (2.8% vs 6.5%, p=0.015); the prevalence of positive serology in 5-14 year-olds had been 21.7% (95% CI=14.6%-30.9%) 6 months prior to mass treatment. Not receiving azithromycin was associated with an odds of 3.9 for infection (p=0.001). National figures showed a 57% reduction in reported cases of yaws following mass treatment. Discussion Following a single round of treatment we did not identify any cases of active yaws in a previously endemic population. We found a significant reduction in latent infection. Our data support expansion of the WHO eradication strategy and suggest an integrated approach to the control of yaws and trachoma in the Pacific may be viable.","[Marks, Michael; Solomon, Anthony W.; Mabey, David C.] London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, Fac Infect & Trop Dis, Dept Clin Res, London WC1, England; [Marks, Michael; Solomon, Anthony W.; Mabey, David C.] Mortimer Market Ctr, Hosp Trop Dis, London, England; [Vahi, Ventis; Sokana, Oliver; Puiahi, Elliot; Dalipanda, Tenneth] Minist Hlth & Med Serv, Honiara, Solomon Islands; [Chi, Kai-Hua; Pillay, Allan] Ctr Dis Control & Prevent, Mol Diagnost & Typing Lab, Lab Reference & Res Branch, DSTDP, Atlanta, GA USA; [Kilua, Georgina] WHO, Western Pacific Reg Off, Honiara, Solomon Islands; [Bottomley, Christian] London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, Dept Infect Dis Epidemiol, London WC1, England","Marks, M (reprint author), London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, Fac Infect & Trop Dis, Dept Clin Res, London WC1, England.",Michael.marks@lshtm.ac.uk,,"Mabey, David/0000-0002-0031-8276; Marks, Michael/0000-0002-7585-4743; Solomon, Anthony/0000-0001-7101-6649","Wellcome Trust Clinical Research Fellowship [102807, 098521]; CDC; Medical Research Council [MR/K012126/1]","MM is supported by a Wellcome Trust Clinical Research Fellowship - 102807.

It has been gathering interest due to increases in non-vectorial forms of transmission, especially in developed countries. The objective of this work was to investigate if adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (ASC) can alter the course of the disease and attenuate pathology in a mouse model of chagasic cardiomyopathy. Methodology/Principal Findings ASC were injected intraperitoneally at 3 days post-infection (dpi). Tracking by bioluminescence showed that cells remained in the abdominal cavity for up to 9 days after injection and most of them migrated to the abdominal or subcutaneous fat, an early parasite reservoir. ASC injection resulted in a significant reduction in blood parasitemia, which was followed by a decrease in cardiac tissue inflammation, parasitism and fibrosis at 30 dpi. At the same time point, analyses of cytokine release in cells isolated from the heart and exposed to T.cruzi antigens indicated an anti-inflammatory response in ASC-treated animals. In parallel, splenocytes exposed to the same antigens produced a pro-inflammatory response, which is important for the control of parasite replication, in placebo and ASC-treated groups. However, splenocytes from the ASC group released higher levels of IL-10. At 60 dpi, magnetic resonance imaging revealed that right ventricular (RV) dilation was prevented in ASC-treated mice. Conclusions/Significance In conclusion, the injection of ASC early after T. cruzi infection prevents RV remodeling through the modulation of immune responses. Lymphoid organ response to the parasite promoted the control of parasite burden, while the heart, a target organ of Chagas disease, was protected from damage due to an improved control of inflammation in ASC-treated mice.","[Mello, Debora B.; Ramos, Isalira P.; Mesquita, Fernanda C.

Dynamic modeling techniques can be used to examine how interactions among meteorological variables, vectors and the dengue virus influence transmission. We developed a dengue fever simulation model by coupling a dynamic simulation model for Aedes aegypti, the primary mosquito vector for dengue, with a basic epidemiological Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered (SEIR) model. Employing a Monte Carlo approach, we simulated dengue transmission during the period of 2010-2013 in San Juan, PR, where dengue fever is endemic. The results of 9600 simulations using varied model parameters were evaluated by statistical comparison (r(2)) with surveillance data of dengue cases reported to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. To identify the most influential parameters associated with dengue virus transmission for each period the top 1% of best-fit model simulations were retained and compared. Using the top simulations, dengue cases were simulated well for 2010 (r(2) = 0.90, p = 0.03), 2011 (r(2) = 0.83, p = 0.05), and 2012 (r(2) = 0.94, p = 0.01); however, simulations were weaker for 2013 (r(2) = 0.25, p = 0.25) and the entire four-year period (r(2) = 0.44, p = 0.002). Analysis of parameter values from retained simulations revealed that rain dependent container habitats were more prevalent in best-fitting simulations during the wetter 2010 and 2011 years, while human managed (i.e. manually filled) container habitats were more prevalent in best-fitting simulations during the drier 2012 and 2013 years. The simulations further indicate that rainfall strongly modulates the timing of dengue (e.g., epidemics occurred earlier during rainy years) while temperature modulates the annual number of dengue fever cases. Our results suggest that meteorological factors have a time-variable influence on dengue transmission relative to other important environmental and human factors.","[Morin, Cory W.] NASA, George C Marshall Space Flight Ctr, Earth Sci Off, Huntsville, AL 35812 USA; [Monaghan, Andrew J.; Hayden, Mary H.] Natl Ctr Atmospher Res, Res Applicat Lab, Boulder, CO USA; [Barrera, Roberto] Ctr Dis Control & Prevent, Dengue Branch, Entomol & Ecol Act, San Juan, PR USA; [Ernst, Kacey] Univ Arizona, Mel & Enid Zuckerman Coll Publ Hlth, Tucson, AZ USA","Morin, CW (reprint author), NASA, George C Marshall Space Flight Ctr, Earth Sci Off, Huntsville, AL 35812 USA.",cory.morin@nasa.gov,,"Monaghan, Andrew/0000-0002-8170-2359","National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Regional Integrated Sciences and Assessments program; National Institutes of Health [IR56AI091843, IR01AI091843]; National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease; National Science Foundation","This research was supported in part by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (noaa.gov) Regional Integrated Sciences and Assessments program (CWM), as well as grants IR56AI091843 and IR01AI091843 from the National Institutes of Health (nih.gov), National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease (KE).

Since a comprehensive review on the scope of the different oral rabies vaccine baits distributed across Europe has not been available yet, we evaluated the use of different vaccine baits over the entire period of ORV [19782014]. Our findings provide valuable insights into the complexity of ORV programs in terms of vaccine related issues. More than 10 oral vaccines against rabies were used over the past four decades. Depending on many factors, the extent to which oral rabies virus vaccines were used varied considerably resulting in huge differences in the number of vaccine doses disseminated in ORV campaigns as well as in large spatial and temporal overlaps. Although vaccine virus strains derived from the SAD rabies virus isolate were the most widely used, the success of ORV campaigns in Europe cannot be assigned to a single oral rabies virus vaccine alone. Rather, the successful elimination of fox rabies is the result of an interaction of different key components of ORV campaigns, i.e. vaccine strain, vaccine bait and strategy of distribution.","[Mueller, Thomas F.; Mettenleiter, Thomas C.; Freuling, Conrad M.] Friedrich Loeffler Inst, WHO Collaborating Ctr Rabies Surveillance & Res, Inst Mol Virol & Cell Biol, Greifswald, Germany; [Schroeder, Ronald; Wysocki, Patrick] Friedrich Loeffler Inst, Inst Epidemiol, Greifswald, Germany","Muller, TF (reprint author), Friedrich Loeffler Inst, WHO Collaborating Ctr Rabies Surveillance & Res, Inst Mol Virol & Cell Biol, Greifswald, Germany.",thomas.mueller@fli.bund.de,,,"intramural collaborative research grant; Research and Policy for Infectious Disease Dynamics (RAPIDD) program of the Science & Technology Directorate, U.S. Department of Homeland Security; Fogarty International Center, National Institutes of Health","This study was supported by an intramural collaborative research grant and financing of the Research and Policy for Infectious Disease Dynamics (RAPIDD) program of the Science & Technology Directorate, U.S. Department of Homeland Security, and the Fogarty International Center, National Institutes of Health.

In this single-centered, cross-sectional, community-based study, the role of neurocysticercosis (NCC) as a cause of epilepsy was examined. People with epilepsy (PWE, n = 56) were identified in an endemic area using a screening questionnaire followed by in-depth interviews and neurological examination. Computed tomography (CT) was performed on 49 people with active epilepsy (PWAE) and their sera (specific antibody and antigen detection, n = 56) and stools (copro-antigen detection, n = 54) were analyzed. The CT scan findings were compared to a group of 40 CT scan controls. Of the PWE, 39.3% and 23.2% were positive for cysticercal antibodies and antigens, respectively, and 14.8% for coproantigens (taeniosis). Lesions highly suggestive of NCC were detected in 24.5% and definite NCC lesions in 4.1% of CT scans of PWAE. This compares to 2.5% and 0%, respectively, in the control CT scans. Using the Del Brutto diagnostic criteria, 51.8% of the PWAE were diagnosed with probable or definitive NCC and this rose to 57.1% when the adapted criteria, as proposed by Gabriel et al. (adding the sero-antigen ELISA test as a major criterion), were used. There was no statistically significant relationship between NCC, current age, age at first seizure and gender. This study suggests that NCC is the single most important cause of epilepsy in the study area. Additional large-scale studies, combining a community based prevalence study for epilepsy with neuroimaging and serological analysis in different areas are needed to estimate the true impact of neurocysticercosis in endemic regions and efforts should be instituted to the control of T. solium.","[Mwape, Kabemba E.; Phiri, Isaac K.] Univ Zambia, Dept Clin Studies, Sch Vet Med, Lusaka, Zambia; [Blocher, Joachim] Med Univ Ctr Gottingen, Dept Neurol, Gottingen, Germany; [Blocher, Joachim; Schmidt, Holger] Elbe Kliniken Stade Buxtehude GmbH, Dept Neurol, Stade, Germany; [Wiefek, Jasmin] Europe Univ Flensburg, Flensburg, Germany; [Schmidt, Kathie] Med Univ Ctr Gottingen, Dept Neuroradiol, Gottingen, Germany; [Dorny, Pierre; Praet, Nicolas; Gabriel, Sarah] Inst Trop Med, Dept Biomed Sci, B-2000 Antwerp, Belgium; [Chiluba, Clarance] Levy Mwanawasa Gen Hosp, Lusaka, Zambia; [Winkler, Andrea S.] Tech Univ Munich, Dept Neurol, D-80290 Munich, Germany","Mwape, KE (reprint author), Univ Zambia, Dept Clin Studies, Sch Vet Med, Lusaka, Zambia.",Joachim.blocher@med.uni-goettingen.de,"Dorny, Pierre/B-8590-2008",,Flemish Inter-University Council [VLIR-UOS.ZIUS2008RIP-8961]; COST Action [TD1302]; German Research Foundation; Open Access Publication Funds of Gottingen University,"The study was funded by the Flemish Inter-University Council (VLIR-UOS.ZIUS2008RIP-8961), the ITM-DVTD framework agreement 3 and COST Action TD1302 ""European Network on Taeniosis/Cysticercosis CYSTINET"".

Leptospirosis is a systemic disease that in its severest forms leads to renal insufficiency, hepatic dysfunction, and pulmonary failure. Many strains of Leptospira produce hemolytic and sphingomyelinase activities, and a number of candidate leptospiral hemolysins have been identified based on sequence similarity to well-characterized bacterial hemolysins. Five of the putative hemolysins are sphingomyelinase paralogs. Although recombinant forms of the sphingomyelinase Sph2 and other hemolysins lyse erythrocytes, none have been demonstrated to contribute to the hemolytic activity secreted by leptospiral cells. In this study, we examined the regulation of sph2 and its relationship to hemolytic and sphingomyelinase activities produced by several L. interrogans strains cultivated under the osmotic conditions found in the mammalian host. The sph2 gene was poorly expressed when the Fiocruz L1-130 (serovar Copenhageni), 56601 (sv. Lai), and L495 (sv. Manilae) strains were cultivated in the standard culture medium EMJH. Raising EMJH osmolarity to physiological levels with sodium chloride enhanced Sph2 production in all three strains. In addition, the Pomona subtype kennewicki strain LC82-25 produced substantially greater amounts of Sph2 during standard EMJH growth than the other strains, and sph2 expression increased further by addition of salt. When 10% rat serum was present in EMJH along with the sodium chloride supplement, Sph2 production increased further in all strains. Osmotic regulation and differences in basal Sph2 production in the Manilae L495 and Pomona strains correlated with the levels of secreted hemolysin and sphingomyelinase activities. Finally, a transposon insertion in sph2 dramatically reduced hemolytic and sphingomyelinase activities during incubation of L. interrogans at physiologic osmolarity. Complementation of the mutation with the sph2 gene partially restored production of hemolytic and sphingomyelinase activities. These results indicate that the sph2 gene product contributes to the hemolytic and sphingomyelinase activities secreted by L. interrogans and most likely dominates those functions under the culture condition tested.","[Narayanavari, Suneel A.; Sritharan, Manjula] Univ Hyderabad, Dept Anim Biol, Hyderabad 500134, Andhra Pradesh, India; [Lourdault, Kristel; Matsunaga, James] Vet Affairs Greater Los Angeles Healthcare Syst, Res Serv, Los Angeles, CA USA; [Lourdault, Kristel; Haake, David A.; Matsunaga, James] Univ Calif Los Angeles, David Geffen Sch Med, Dept Med, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Haake, David A.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, David Geffen Sch Med, Dept Urol, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Haake, David A.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Microbiol Immunol & Mol Genet, Los Angeles, CA USA; [Haake, David A.] Vet Affairs Greater Los Angeles Healthcare Syst, Div Infect Dis, Los Angeles, CA USA","Narayanavari, SA (reprint author), Max Delbruck Ctr Mol Med, Berlin, Germany.",jamesm@ucla.edu,"Narayanavari, Suneel A./I-8063-2019","Narayanavari, Suneel A./0000-0002-6997-4829",Veterans Affairs Merit Award; United States India Educational Foundation (USIEF) [15111348]; National Institutes of Health [R01 AI 034431],"This work was supported by a Veterans Affairs Merit Award to JM, a Fulbright-Nehru Doctoral and Professional Research Fellowship (Grantee ID: 15111348) from the United States India Educational Foundation (USIEF) to SAN, and National Institutes of Health grant R01 AI 034431 to DAH.

This study analyzed the plasma levels of nucleosomes, FSAP-activation (nucleosome-releasing factor), and neutrophil activation, as evidenced by neutrophil-elastase (ELA) complexes, in sympatric Lao patients with scrub typhus and murine typhus. In acute scrub typhus elevated nucleosome levels correlated with lower GCS scores, raised respiratory rate, jaundice and impaired liver function, whereas neutrophil activation correlated with fibrinolysis and high IL8 plasma levels, a recently identified predictor of severe disease and mortality. Nucleosome and ELA complex levels were associated with a 4.8-fold and 4-fold increased risk of developing severe scrub typhus, beyond cut off values of 1,040 U/ml for nucleosomes and 275 U/ml for ELA complexes respectively. In murine typhus, nucleosome levels associated with pro-inflammatory cytokines and the duration of illness, while ELA complexes correlated strongly with inflammation markers, jaundice and increased respiratory rates. This study found strong correlations between circulating nucleosomes and neutrophil activation in patients with scrub typhus, but not murine typhus, providing indirect evidence that nucleosomes could originate from neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) degradation. High circulating plasma nucleosomes and ELA complexes represent independent risk factors for developing severe complications in scrub typhus. As nucleosomes and histones exposed on NETs are highly cytotoxic to endothelial cells and are strongly pro-coagulant, neutrophil-derived nucleosomes could contribute to vascular damage, the pro-coagulant state and exacerbation of disease in scrub typhus, thus indicating a detrimental role of neutrophil activation. The data suggest that increased neutrophil activation relates to disease progression and severe complications, and increased plasma levels of nucleosomes and ELA complexes represent independent risk factors for developing severe scrub typhus.","[Paris, Daniel H.; Day, Nicholas P.

A number of studies have shown that stage differentiation is a stochastic process and is associated with a point that commits the cell to a change over in the pattern of gene expression. Studies on differentiation to merozoite production (merogony) in T. annulata postulated that commitment involves a concentration threshold of DNA binding proteins and an auto-regulatory loop. Principal Findings In this study ApiAP2 DNA binding proteins that show changes in expression level during merogony of T. annulata have been identified. DNA motifs bound by orthologous domains in Plasmodium were found to be enriched in upstream regions of stage-regulated T. annulata genes and validated as targets for the T. annulata AP2 domains by electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA). Two findings were of particular note: the gene in T. annulata encoding the orthologue of the ApiAP2 domain in the AP2-G factor that commits Plasmodium to gametocyte production, has an expression profile indicating involvement in transmission of T. annulata to the tick vector; genes encoding related domains that bind, or are predicted to bind, sequence motifs of the type 5'-(A)CACAC(A) are implicated in differential regulation of gene expression, with one gene (TA11145) likely to be preferentially up-regulated via auto-regulation as the cell progresses to merogony. Conclusions We postulate that the Theileria factor possessing the AP2 domain orthologous to that of Plasmodium AP2-G may regulate gametocytogenesis in a similar manner to AP2-G. In addition, paralogous ApiAP2 factors that recognise 5'-(A) CACAC(A) type motifs could operate in a competitive manner to promote reversible progression towards the point that commits the cell to undergo merogony. Factors possessing AP2 domains that bind (or are predicted to bind) this motif are present in the vector-borne genera Theileria, Babesia and Plasmodium, and other Apicomplexa; leading to the proposal that the mechanisms that control stage differentiation will show a degree of conservation.","[Pieszko, Marta; Weir, William; Kinnaird, Jane; Shiels, Brian] Univ Glasgow, Inst Biodivers Anim Hlth & Comparat Med, Coll Med Vet & Life Sci, Glasgow, Lanark, Scotland; [Goodhead, Ian] Univ Liverpool, Inst Integrat Biol, Liverpool L69 3BX, Merseyside, England","Pieszko, M (reprint author), Univ Glasgow, Inst Biodivers Anim Hlth & Comparat Med, Coll Med Vet & Life Sci, Bearsden Rd, Glasgow, Lanark, Scotland.",brian.shiels@glasgow.ac.uk,,"Shiels, Brian/0000-0001-7595-2514; Weir, William/0000-0001-8648-666X; Goodhead, Ian/0000-0002-3110-9442",Wellcome Trust [WT075820]; EU [238511],"The work was supported by grant awards from the Wellcome Trust (http://wellcome.ac.uk/) grant number WT075820 and the EU (http://europa.eu/): POSTICK ITN (Post-graduate training network for capacity building to control ticks and tick-borne diseases) FP7-PEOPLE-ITN program (Grant No. 238511).

Assessing their microbial diversity at both the individual and population level is crucial for monitoring endemic infections and revealing microbial association patterns within reservoirs. Recently, NGS approaches have been employed to characterize microbial communities of different ecosystems. Yet, their relative efficacy has not been assessed. Here, we compared two NGS approaches, RNA-Sequencing (RNA-Seq) and 16S-metagenomics, assessing their ability to survey neglected zoonotic bacteria in rodent populations. Methodology/Principal Findings We first extracted nucleic acids from the spleens of 190 voles collected in France. RNA extracts were pooled, randomly retro-transcribed, then RNA-Seq was performed using HiSeq. Assembled bacterial sequences were assigned to the closest taxon registered in GenBank. DNA extracts were analyzed via a 16S-metagenomics approach using two sequencers: the 454 GS-FLX and the MiSeq. The V4 region of the gene coding for 16S rRNA was amplified for each sample using barcoded universal primers. Amplicons were multiplexed and processed on the distinct sequencers. The resulting datasets were de-multiplexed, and each read was processed through a pipeline to be taxonomically classified using the Ribosomal Database Project. Altogether, 45 pathogenic bacterial genera were detected. The bacteria identified by RNA-Seq were comparable to those detected by 16S-metagenomics approach processed with MiSeq (16S-MiSeq). In contrast, 21 of these pathogens went unnoticed when the 16S-metagenomics approach was processed via 454-pyrosequencing (16S-454). In addition, the 16S-metagenomics approaches revealed a high level of coinfection in bank voles. Conclusions/Significance We concluded that RNA-Seq and 16S-MiSeq are equally sensitive in detecting bacteria. Although only the 16S-MiSeq method enabled identification of bacteria in each individual reservoir, with subsequent derivation of bacterial prevalence in host populations, and generation of intra-reservoir patterns of bacterial interactions. Lastly, the number of bacterial reads obtained with the 16S-MiSeq could be a good proxy for bacterial prevalence.","[Razzauti, Maria; Galan, Maxime; Charbonnel, Nathalie; Cosson, Jean-Francois] INRA, UMR CBGP INRA IRD Cirad Montpellier SupAgro, F-34060 Montpellier, France; [Bernard, Maria] INRA, GABI, Jouy En Josas, France; [Maman, Sarah; Klopp, Christophe] INRA, INRA Auzeville, GenPhySE, Sigenae Grp, F-31326 Castanet Tolosan, France; [Vayssier-Taussat, Muriel] INRA, ENVA, UMR Bipar, ANSES,USC INRA, Maisons Alfort, France; [Eloit, Marc] PathoQuest SAS, Paris, France; [Eloit, Marc] Ecole Natl Vet Alfort, INRA, ANSES, UMR 1161,Virol ENVA, Maisons Alfort, France; [Eloit, Marc] Inst Pasteur, Inserm U1117, Lab Pathogen Discovery, Biol Infect Unit, Paris, France","Razzauti, M (reprint author), INRA, UMR CBGP INRA IRD Cirad Montpellier SupAgro, F-34060 Montpellier, France.",cosson@supagro.inra.fr,"Charbonnel, Nathalie/B-2601-2013; Klopp, Christophe/J-3164-2019","Charbonnel, Nathalie/0000-0002-7907-6539; Klopp, Christophe/0000-0001-7126-5477; Cosson, Jean Francois/0000-0003-0863-5871",European Union through AgreenSkills fellowship [267196]; PATHO-ID project - meta-program Meta-omics des Ecosystems Microbiens (MEM) of French National Institut for Agricultural Research (INRA); COST Action (EurNegVec) [TD1303]; EU grant [FP7-261504 EDENext],"MR received the support of the European Union, under the framework of the Marie-Curie FP7 COFUND People Program, through the award of an AgreenSkills fellowship (grant agreement no 267196).

Cell wall components of P. brasiliensis interact with host cells and influence the pathogenesis of PCM. In yeast, many glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored proteins are important in the initial contact with the host, mediating host-yeast interactions that culminate with the disease. PbPga1 is a GPI anchored protein located on the surface of the yeast P. brasiliensis that is recognized by sera from PCM patients. Methodology/Principal Findings Endogenous PbPga1 was localized to the surface of P. brasiliensis yeast cells in the lungs of infected mice using a polyclonal anti-rPbPga1 antibody. Furthermore, macrophages stained with anti-CD38 were associated with P. brasiliensis containing granulomas. Additionally, rPbPga1 activated the transcription factor NFkB in the macrophage cell line Raw 264.7 Luc cells, containing the luciferase gene downstream of the NFkB promoter. After 24 h of incubation with rPbPga1, alveolar macrophages from BALB/c mice were stimulated to release TNF-alpha, IL-4 and NO. Mast cells, identified by toluidine blue staining, were also associated with P. brasiliensis containing granulomas. Co-culture of P. Brasiliensis yeast cells with RBL-2H3 mast cells induced morphological changes on the surface of the mast cells. Furthermore, RBL-2H3 mast cells were degranulated by P. brasiliensis yeast cells, but not by rPbPga1, as determined by the release of beta-hexosaminidase. However, RBL-2H3 cells activated by rPbPga1 released the inflammatory interleukin IL-6 and also activated the transcription factor NFkB in GFP-reporter mast cells. The transcription factor NFAT was not activated when the mast cells were incubated with rPbPga1. Conclusions/Significance The results indicate that PbPga1 may act as a modulator protein in PCM pathogenesis and serve as a useful target for additional studies on the pathogenesis of P. brasiliensis.","[Resende Valim, Clarissa Xavier] Sao Rafael Hosp, Ctr Biotecnol Terapia Celular, Salvador, BA, Brazil; [Marcelino da Silva, Elaine Zayas; Assis, Mariana Aprigio; Fernandes, Fabricio Freitas; Rodrigues Coelho, Paulo Sergio; Oliver, Constance; Jamur, Maria Celia] Univ Sao Paulo, Ribeirao Preto Med Sch, Dept Cell & Mol Biol & Pathogen Bioagents, Sao Paulo, Brazil","Valim, CXR (reprint author), Sao Rafael Hosp, Ctr Biotecnol Terapia Celular, Salvador, BA, Brazil.",mjamur@fmrp.usp.br,"Jamur, Maria Celia/L-5520-2016; Da Silva, Elaine Z/O-5535-2015","Jamur, Maria Celia/0000-0001-7065-8543; Da Silva, Elaine Z/0000-0002-2749-6275","Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo-FAPESP [2009/52796-8, 2008/55831-6]; Conselho Nacional de Pesquisa-CNPq [305531/2011-5]","This work was funded by Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo-FAPESP (fellowship to CXRV, 2009/52796-8 and research grant to PSRC, 2008/55831-6) (www.fapesp.br), and by Conselho Nacional de Pesquisa-CNPq (www.cnpq.br) (fellowship to MCJ, 305531/2011-5).

Epidemiological surveillance has highlighted an overwhelming occurrence of the highly pathogenic fungus Sporothrix brasiliensis during feline outbreaks, leading to massive transmissions to humans. Early diagnosis of feline sporotrichosis by demonstrating the presence of a surrogate marker of infection can have a key role for selecting appropriate disease control measures and minimizing zoonotic transmission to humans. Methodology We explored the presence and diversity of serum antibodies (IgG) specific against Sporothrix antigens in cats with sporotrichosis and evaluated the utility of these antibodies for serodiagnosis. Antigen profiling included protein extracts from the closest known relatives S. brasiliensis and S. schenckii. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays and immunoblotting enabled us to characterize the major antigens of feline sporotrichosis from sera from cats with sporotrichosis (n = 49), healthy cats (n = 19), and cats with other diseases (n = 20). Principal Findings Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay-based quantitation of anti-Sporothrix IgG exhibited high sensitivity and specificity in cats with sporotrichosis (area under the curve, 1.0; 95% confidence interval, 0.94-1; P<0.0001) versus controls. The two sets of Sporothrix antigens were remarkably cross-reactive, supporting the hypothesis that antigenic epitopes may be conserved among closely related agents. One-dimensional immunoblotting indicated that 3-carboxymuconate cyclase (a 60-kDa protein in S. brasiliensis and a 70-kDa protein in S. schenckii) is the immunodominant antigen in feline sporotrichosis. Two-dimensional immunoblotting revealed six IgG-reactive isoforms of gp60 in the S. brasiliensis proteome, similar to the humoral response found in human sporotrichosis. Conclusions A convergent IgG-response in various hosts (mice, cats, and humans) has important implications for our understanding of the coevolution of Sporothrix and its warm-blooded hosts. We propose that 3-carboxymuconate cyclase has potential for the serological diagnosis of sporotrichosis and as target for the development of an effective multi-species vaccine against sporotrichosis in animals and humans.","[Rodrigues, Anderson Messias; Fernandes, Geisa Ferreira; Araujo, Leticia Mendes; Della Terra, Paula Portella; dos Santos, Priscila Oliveira; de Camargo, Zoilo Pires] Univ Fed Sao Paulo, Dept Microbiol Immunol & Parasitol, Discipline Cellular Biol, Sao Carlos, SP, Brazil; [Pereira, Sandro Antonio; Pacheco Schubach, Tania Maria] Fundacao Oswaldo Cruz INI Fiocruz, Inst Nacl Infectol Evandro Chagas, Rio De Janeiro, Brazil; [Burger, Eva] Univ Fed Alfenas, Dept Microbiol & Immunol, Inst Biomed Sci, Alfenas, Brazil; [Lopes-Bezerra, Leila Maria] Univ Estado Rio de Janeiro, Inst Biol IBRAG, BR-20550011 Rio De Janeiro, Brazil","Rodrigues, AM (reprint author), Univ Fed Sao Paulo, Dept Microbiol Immunol & Parasitol, Discipline Cellular Biol, Sao Carlos, SP, Brazil.",amrodrigues.amr@gmail.com; zpcamargo1@gmail.com,"Rodrigues, Anderson M./V-4069-2019; Camargo, Zoilo/C-5305-2013; Rodrigues, Anderson/C-5915-2013","Rodrigues, Anderson M./0000-0003-0891-4563; Camargo, Zoilo/0000-0002-2971-7983; Rodrigues, Anderson/0000-0003-0891-4563; Oliveira Fideles dos Santos, Priscila/0000-0001-5427-3379",Sao Paulo Research Foundation [FAPESP 2009/54024-2]; National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq); AMR [FAPESP 2011/07350-1]; GFF [FAPESP 2011/01628-8]; National Council for Scientific and Technological Development; Coordination for the improvement of higher education,"ZPdC acknowledge financial support from the Sao Paulo Research Foundation (FAPESP 2009/54024-2) and the National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq).

For example, bivalent methylation of histone H3K4 and H3K27 is linked to poised transcription in vertebrate embryonic stem cells (ESC). It allows them to rapidly engage specific developmental pathways. We reasoned that non-vertebrate metazoans that encounter a similar developmental constraint (i.e. to quickly start development into a new phenotype) might use a similar system. Schistosomes are parasitic platyhelminthes that are characterized by passage through two hosts: a mollusk as intermediate host and humans or rodents as definitive host. During its development, the parasite undergoes drastic changes, most notable immediately after infection of the definitive host, i.e. during the transition from the free-swimming cercariae into adult worms. Methodology/Principal Findings We used Chromatin Immunoprecipitation followed by massive parallel sequencing (ChIP-Seq) to analyze genome-wide chromatin structure of S. mansoni on the level of histone modifications (H3K4me3, H3K27me3, H3K9me3, and H3K9ac) in cercariae, schistosomula and adults (available at http://genome.univ-perp.fr). We saw striking differences in chromatin structure between the developmental stages, but most importantly we found that cercariae possess a specific combination of marks at the transcription start sites (TSS) that has similarities to a structure found in ESC. We demonstrate that in cercariae no transcription occurs, and we provide evidences that cercariae do not possess large numbers of canonical stem cells. Conclusions/Significance We describe here a broad view on the epigenome of a metazoan parasite. Most notably, we find bivalent histone H3 methylation in cercariae. Methylation of H3K27 is removed during transformation into schistosomula (and stays absent in adults) and transcription is activated. In addition, shifts of H3K9 methylation and acetylation occur towards upstream and downstream of the transcriptional start site (TSS). We conclude that specific H3 modifications are a phylogenetically older and probably more general mechanism, i.e. not restricted to stem cells, to poise transcription.

A panel containing nearly all macrocyclic lactones used in human or in veterinary medicine was analyzed for activity in vitro against clinical isolates of Mycobacterium ulcerans. Milbemycin oxime and selamectin were the most active drugs against M. ulcerans with MIC values from 2 to 8 mu g/mL and 2 to 4 mu g/mL, respectively. In contrast, ivermectin and moxidectin, which are both in clinical use, showed no significant activity (MIC> 32 mu g/mL). Time-kill kinetic assays showed bactericidal activity of selamectin and in vitro pharmacodynamic studies demonstrated exposure-dependent activity. These data together with analyses of published pharmacokinetic information strongly suggest that selamectin is the most promising macrocyclic lactone for BU treatment.","[Scherr, Nicole; Pluschke, Gerd] Swiss Trop & Publ Hlth Inst, Dept Med Parasitol & Infect Biol, Basel, Switzerland; [Scherr, Nicole; Pluschke, Gerd] Univ Basel, Basel, Switzerland; [Thompson, Charles J.; Ramon-Garcia, Santiago] Univ British Columbia, Life Sci Ctr, Ctr TB Res, Dept Microbiol & Immunol, Vancouver, BC, Canada","Scherr, N (reprint author), Swiss Trop & Publ Hlth Inst, Dept Med Parasitol & Infect Biol, Basel, Switzerland.",ramon@mail.ubc.ca,"ramon, santi/C-6077-2013; Ramon Garcia, Santiago/V-8242-2017","ramon, santi/0000-0002-8480-0325; Ramon Garcia, Santiago/0000-0002-8480-0325",Canadian Institute of Health Research [MOP-82855]; British Columbia Lung Association,"This work was supported by grants from the Canadian Institute of Health Research (MOP-82855) to CJT and the British Columbia Lung Association to SRG and CJT.

However, little is known about Treg functional capacity during human Schistosoma haematobium infection. Methodology CD4(+)CD25(hi)FOXP(3+) cells were characterized by flow cytometry and their function assessed by analysing total and Treg-depleted PBMC responses to schistosomal adult worm antigen (AWA), soluable egg antigen (SEA) and Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) in S. haematobium-infected Gabonese children before and 6 weeks after anthelmintic treatment. Cytokines responses (IFN-, IL-5, IL-10, IL-13, IL-17 and TNF) were integrated using Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Proliferation was measured by CFSE. Principal Findings S. haematobium infection was associated with increased Treg frequencies, which decreased post-treatment. Cytokine responses clustered into two principal components reflecting regulatory and Th2-polarized (PC1) and pro-inflammatory and Th1-polarized (PC2) cytokine responses; both components increased post-treatment. Treg depletion resulted in increased PC1 and PC2 at both time-points. Proliferation on the other hand, showed no significant difference from pre-to post-treatment. Treg depletion resulted mostly in increased proliferative responses at the pre-treatment time-point only. Conclusions Schistosoma-associated CD4(+)CD25(hi)FOXP(3+) Tregs exert a suppressive effect on both proliferation and cytokine production. Although Treg frequency decreases after praziquantel treatment, their suppressive capacity remains unaltered when considering cytokine production whereas their influence on proliferation weakens with treatment.","[Schmiedel, Yvonne; Mombo-Ngoma, Ghyslain; Labuda, Lucja A.; Adegnika, Ayola A.; Issifou, Saadou; Kremsner, Peter G.] Ctr Rech Med Lambarene CERMEL, Lambarene, Gabon; [Schmiedel, Yvonne; Mombo-Ngoma, Ghyslain; Labuda, Lucja A.; Adegnika, Ayola A.; Issifou, Saadou; Kremsner, Peter G.] Univ Tubingen, Inst Tropenmed, Tubingen, Germany; [Mombo-Ngoma, Ghyslain] Univ Sci Sante, Fac Med, Dept Parasitol Mycol, Libreville, Gabon; [Labuda, Lucja A.; Janse, Jacqueline J.; de Gier, Brechje; Adegnika, Ayola A.; Smits, Hermelijn H.; Yazdanbakhsh, Maria] Leiden Univ, Med Ctr, Dept Parasitol, Leiden, Netherlands","Schmiedel, Y (reprint author), Ctr Rech Med Lambarene CERMEL, BP118, Lambarene, Gabon.",a.a.adegnika@medizin.uni-tuebingen.de,"Smits, Hermelijn/V-4216-2018; Mombo-Ngoma, Ghyslain/I-4305-2019","Smits, Hermelijn/0000-0001-9279-2890; Mombo-Ngoma, Ghyslain/0000-0003-2658-8706; Yazdanbakhsh, Maria/0000-0002-7666-1441","EU [INCO-CT-2006-032436, INCO-CT-2006-032405]; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschft; University Tubingen","This work was supported by the EU-funded project T Cell Regulation and the Control of Helminth Infections ""TRANCHI"" (INCO-CT-2006-032436) and the EU-funded project Innate Immune Responses and Immunoregulation in Schistosomiasis: Novel mechanisms in the control of infection and disease ""SCHISTOINIR"" (INCO-CT-2006-032405).

However, the rapid spread of pyrethroid resistance worldwide compromises the effectiveness of control programs and threatens public health. Since few new insecticide classes for vector control are anticipated, limiting the development of resistance is crucial for prolonging efficacy of pyrethroids. In this study, we exposed a field-collected population of Culex pipiens pallens to different insecticide selection intensities to dynamically monitor the development of resistance. Moreover, we detected kdr mutations and three detoxification enzyme activities in order to explore the evolutionary mechanism of pyrethroid resistance. Our results revealed that the level of pyrethroid resistance was proportional to the insecticide selection pressure. The kdr and metabolic resistance both contributed to pyrethroid resistance in the Cx. pipiens pallens populations, but they had different roles under different selection pressures. We have provided important evidence for better understanding of the development and mechanisms of pyrethroid resistance which may guide future insecticide use and vector management in order to avoid or delay resistance.","[Shi, Linna; Hu, Hongxia; Ma, Kai; Zhou, Dan; Yu, Jing; Fang, Fujin; Chang, Xuelian; Hu, Shengli; Zou, Feifei; Wang, Weijie; Sun, Yan; Shen, Bo; Zhang, Donghui; Ma, Lei; Zhu, Changliang] Nanjing Med Univ, Dept Pathogen Biol, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Shi, Linna] Shaanxi Univ Chinese Med, Dept Pathogen Microorganism & Lab Med, Xianyang, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [Zhong, Daibin; Zhou, Guofa; Yan, Guiyun] Univ Calif Irvine, Program Publ Hlth, Coll Hlth Sci, Irvine, CA USA","Shi, LN (reprint author), Nanjing Med Univ, Dept Pathogen Biol, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",clzhu@njmu.edu.cn,,,"National Institutes of Health of US (NIH) [2R01AI075746]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [81171610, 81101279, 81301458]; National S & T Major Program [2012ZX10004-219, 2012ZX10004-220]; Specialized Research Fund for Doctoral Program of Higher Education of China [20113234120007]; Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province [81101279]","The sources of funding include: the National Institutes of Health of US (NIH)(Grant No. 2R01AI075746), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 81171610, 81101279 and 81301458), the National S & T Major Program (Grant No. 2012ZX10004-219 and 2012ZX10004-220), Specialized Research Fund for the Doctoral Program of Higher Education of China (Grant No. 20113234120007), and Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province (Grant No. 81101279).

For this objective, we studied vectors and domestic reservoirs and evaluated different environmental variables simultaneously, so we constructed a set of 13 models to account for microhabitats, macro-habitats and mixed-habitats. We captured a total of 853 sandflies, of which 98.35% were Lu. longipalpis. We sampled a total of 197 dogs; 177 of which were associated with households where insects were sampled. Positive rK39 dogs represented 16.75% of the total, of which 47% were asymptomatic. Distance to the border of the city and high to medium density vegetation cover ended to be the explanatory variables, all positive, for the presence of sandflies in the city. All variables in the abundance model ended to be explanatory, trees around the trap, distance to the stream and its quadratic, being the last one the only one with negative coefficient indicating that the maximum abundance was associated with medium values of distance to the stream. The spatial distribution of dogs infected with L. infantum showed a heterogeneous pattern throughout the city; however, we could not confirm an association of the distribution with the variables assessed. In relation to Lu. longipalpis distribution, the strategy to discriminate the micro-spatial scales at which the environmental variables were recorded allowed us to associate presence with macrohabitat variables and abundance with microhabitat and macrohabitat variables. Based on the variables associated with Lu. longipalpis, the model will be validated in other cities and environmental surveillance, and control interventions will be proposed and evaluated in the microscale level and integrated with socio-cultural approaches and programmatic and village (mesoscale) strategies.","[Soledad Santini, Maria] Minist Salud Nac, Ctr Nacl Invest Endemoepidemias CeNDIE, ANLIS, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [Soledad Santini, Maria; Berrozpe, Pablo; Daniel Salomon, O.] Minist Ciencia Tecnol & Innovac Prod, Comite Nacl Invest Cient & Tecn CONICET, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [Soledad Santini, Maria; Eugenia Utges, Maria; Berrozpe, Pablo; Manteca Acosta, Mariana; Casas, Natalia; Daniel Salomon, O.] Leishmaniasis Invest Network Argentina ReDILA, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [Eugenia Utges, Maria; Berrozpe, Pablo; Manteca Acosta, Mariana; Daniel Salomon, O.] Minist Salud Nac, Inst Nacl Med Trop INMeT, Puerto Iguazu, Misiones, Argentina; [Casas, Natalia] Minist Salud Nac, Programa Nacl Control Enfermedades Zoonot ProNCEZ, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [Heuer, Paola] Fdn HA Barcelo, Lab Control Vectores Entomol Importania Sanitaria, Sede Santo Tome, Corrientes, Argentina","Santini, MS (reprint author), Minist Salud Nac, Ctr Nacl Invest Endemoepidemias CeNDIE, ANLIS, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina.",mariasoledadsantini@gmail.com,,"Utges, Maria Eugenia/0000-0002-8577-0359","National Ministry of Health; National Ministry of Science, Technology and Productive Innovation [PICTO-20110161]","This study was developed with research funding provided in 2011 by the National Ministry of Health and the National Ministry of Science, Technology and Productive Innovation (PICTO-20110161) which title is Eco-epidemiologia, biologia y distribucion de Phlebotominae vectores de las Leishmania sp., en las regiones NOA, NEA y Chaquena.

We assessed the diagnostic value of selected Schistosoma antigens for the development of a multiplex serological immunoassay for sero-epidemiological surveillance. Methodology/Principal Findings Diagnostic ability of recombinant antigens from S. mansoni and S. haematobium was assessed by Luminex multiplex immunoassay using plasma from school children in two areas of Kenya, endemic for different species of schistosomiasis. S. mansoni serine protease inhibitor (SERPIN) and Sm-RP26 showed significantly higher reactivity to patient plasma as compared to the control group. Sm-Filamin, Sm-GAPDH, Sm-GST, Sm-LAP1, Sm-LAP2, Sm-Sm31, Sm-Sm32 and Sm-Tropomyosin did not show difference in reactivity between S. mansoni infected and uninfected pupils. Sm-RP26 was cross-reactive to plasma from S. haematobium patients, whereas Sm-SERPIN was species-specific. Sh-SEPRIN was partially cross-reactive to S. mansoni infected patients. ROC analysis for Sm-RP26, Sm-SERPIN and Sh-SERPIN showed AUC values of 0.833, 0.888 and 0.947, respectively. Using Spearman's rank correlation coefficient analysis, we also found significant positive correlation between the number of excreted eggs and median fluorescence intensity (MFI) from the multiplex immunoassays for Sm-SERPIN (rho = 0.430, p-value = 0.003) and Sh-SERPIN (rho = 0.433, p-value = 0.006). Conclusions/Significance Sm-SERPIN is a promising species-specific diagnostic antigen. Sh-SEPRIN was partially cross-reactive to S. mansoni infected patients. SERPINs showed correlation with the number of excreted eggs. These indicate prospects for inclusion of SERPINs in the multiplex serological immunoassay system.","[Tanigawa, Chihiro; Fujii, Yoshito; Miura, Masashi; Kaneko, Satoshi] Nagasaki Univ, Dept Ecoepidemiol, Inst Trop Med, Nagasaki 852, Japan; [Nzou, Samson Muuo; Hamano, Shinjiro; Kaneko, Satoshi] Nagasaki Univ Inst Trop Med Kenya Med Res Inst Pr, Nairobi, Kenya; [Nzou, Samson Muuo; Mwau, Matilu] Kenya Govt Med Res Ctr, Ctr Infect & Parasit Dis Control Res, Busia, Kenya; [Mwangi, Anne Wanjiru] Kenya Govt Med Res Ctr, Prod Dept, Busia, Kenya; [Nagi, Sachiyo; Hamano, Shinjiro] Nagasaki Univ, Inst Trop Med, Dept Parasitol, Nagasaki 852, Japan; [Njenga, Sammy M.] Kenya Govt Med Res Ctr, Eastern & Southern Africa Ctr Int Parasite Contro, Nairobi, Kenya; [Mbanefo, Evaristus Chibunna; Hirayama, Kenji] Nagasaki Univ, Inst Trop Med, Dept Immunogenet, Nagasaki 852, Japan; [Mwau, Matilu] Consortium Natl Hlth Res, Nairobi, Kenya; [Kaneko, Satoshi] Nagasaki Univ, Grad Sch Int Hlth Dev, Nagasaki 852, Japan","Tanigawa, C (reprint author), Nagasaki Univ, Dept Ecoepidemiol, Inst Trop Med, Nagasaki 852, Japan.",yfujii@nagasaki-u.ac.jp,"Nzou, Samson/V-5649-2019","Nzou, Samson/0000-0002-5789-4434; Hirayama, Kenji/0000-0001-9467-1777; Kaneko, Satoshi/0000-0001-9464-0911; Njenga, Sammy/0000-0001-6309-476X; Mbanefo, Evaristus/0000-0003-2636-3769","Strategic Promotion of International Cooperation to Accelerate Innovation in Developing Countries; MEXT (Ministry of Education, Sport, Culture, Science and Technology) of Japan","This work was supported by the Program for the Strategic Promotion of International Cooperation to Accelerate Innovation in Developing Countries, Funds for integrated promotion of social system reform and research and development by MEXT (Ministry of Education, Sport, Culture, Science and Technology) of Japan.

To attempt to explain the long-term maintenance of members of this group, we followed Ornithodoros parkeri, O. sonrai, and O. tartakovskyi for > 2,900 days after they had been exposed to Karshi virus, a member of the mammalian tick-borne flavivirus group. Methodology/Principal Findings Ticks were exposed to Karshi virus either by allowing them to feed on viremic suckling mice or by intracoelomic inoculation. The ticks were then allowed to feed individually on suckling mice after various periods of extrinsic incubation to determine their ability to transmit virus by bite and to determine how long the ticks would remain infectious. The ticks remained efficient vectors of Karshi virus, even when tested > 2,900 d after their initial exposure to virus, including those ticks exposed to Karshi virus either orally or by inoculation. Conclusions/Significance Ornithodoros spp. ticks were able to transmit Karshi virus for > 2,900 days (nearly 8 years) after a single exposure to a viremic mouse.

A remarkable example is the outbreak of intestinal schistosomiasis in Northwest Senegal following the construction of two dams in the '80s. While many studies have investigated the epidemiological, immunological and geographical patterns of Schistosoma mansoni infections in this region, little is known about its colonization history. Methodology/Principal Findings Parasites were collected at several time points after the disease outbreak and genotyped using a 420 bp fragment of the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 gene (cox1) and nine nuclear DNA microsatellite markers. Phylogeographic and population genetic analyses revealed the presence of (i) many genetically different haplotypes at the non-recombining mitochondrial marker and (ii) one homogenous S. mansoni genetic group at the recombining microsatellite markers. These results suggest that the S. mansoni population in Northwest Senegal was triggered by intraspecific hybridization (i.e. admixture) between parasites that were introduced from different regions. This would comply with the extensive immigration of infected seasonal agricultural workers from neighboring regions in Senegal, Mauritania and Mali. The spatial and temporal stability of the established S. mansoni population suggests a swift local adaptation of the parasite to the local intermediate snail host Biomphalaria pfeifferi at the onset of the epidemic. Conclusions/Significance Our results show that S. mansoni parasites are very successful in colonizing new areas without significant loss of genetic diversity. Maintaining high levels of diversity guarantees the adaptive potential of these parasites to cope with selective pressures such as drug treatment, which might complicate efforts to control the disease.","[Van den Broeck, Frederik; Maes, Gregory E.; Larmuseau, Maarten H.

China). One of the most important measures in the process of schistosomiasis elimination in P.R. China is control of Oncomelania hupensis, the unique intermediate host snail of Schistosoma japonicum. Compared with plains/swamp and lake regions, the hilly/mountainous regions of schistosomiasis endemic areas are more complicated, which makes the snail survey difficult to conduct precisely and efficiently. There is a pressing call to identify the snail habitats of mountainous regions in an efficient and cost-effective manner. Methods Twelve out of 56 administrative villages distributed with O. hupensis in Eryuan, Yunnan Province, were randomly selected to set up the ecological model. Thirty out of the rest of 78 villages (villages selected for building model were excluded from the villages for validation) in Eryuan and 30 out of 89 villages in Midu, Yunnan Province were selected via a chessboard method for model validation, respectively. Nine-year-average Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Land Surface Temperature (LST) as well as Digital Elevation Model (DEM) covering Eryuan and Midu were extracted from MODIS and ASTER satellite images, respectively. Slope, elevation and the distance from every village to its nearest stream were derived from DEM. Suitable survival environment conditions for snails were defined by comparing historical snail presence data and remote sensing derived images. According to the suitable conditions for snails, environment factors, i.e. NDVI, LST, elevation, slope and the distance from every village to its nearest stream, were integrated into an ecological niche model to predict O. hupensis potential habitats in Eryuan and Midu. The evaluation of the model was assessed by comparing the model prediction and field investigation. Then, the consistency rate of model validation was calculated in Eryuan and Midu Counties, respectively. Results The final ecological niche model for potential O. hupensis habitats prediction comprised the following environmental factors, namely: NDVI (>= 0.446), LST (>= 22.70 degrees C), elevation (<= 2,300 m), slope (<= 11 degrees) and the distance to nearest stream (<= 1,000 m). The potential O. hupensis habitats in Eryuan distributed in the Lancang River basin and O. hupensis in Midu shows a trend of clustering in the north and spotty distribution in the south. The consistency rates of the ecological niche model in Eryuan and Midu were 76.67% and 83.33%, respectively. Conclusions The ecological niche model integrated with NDVI, LST, elevation, slope and distance from every village to its nearest stream adequately predicted the snail habitats in the mountainous regions.","[Zhu, Hong-Ru; Liu, Lu; Yang, Guo-Jing] Jiangsu Inst Parasit Dis, Wuxi, Peoples R China; [Zhu, Hong-Ru; Liu, Lu; Yang, Guo-Jing] Minist Hlth, Key Lab Parasit Dis Control & Prevent, Wuxi, Peoples R China; [Zhu, Hong-Ru; Liu, Lu; Yang, Guo-Jing] Jiangsu Prov Key Lab Parasite Mol Biol, Wuxi, Peoples R China; [Zhou, Xiao-Nong] Chinese Ctr Dis Control & Prevent, Natl Inst Parasit Dis, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Zhou, Xiao-Nong] WHO Collaborating Ctr Malaria Schistosomiasis & F, Key Lab Parasite & Vector Biol, Minist Hlth, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Yang, Guo-Jing] Swiss Trop & Publ Hlth Inst, Dept Epidemiol Publ Hlth, Basel, Switzerland; [Yang, Guo-Jing] Univ Basel, Basel, Switzerland","Zhu, HR (reprint author), Jiangsu Inst Parasit Dis, Wuxi, Peoples R China.",guojingyang@hotmail.com,,,"International Development Research Centre (IDRC), Canada [105509-00001002-024]; National Nature Science Foundation [81102173, 81273192]; Health Promotion Project; Outstanding Person Fund; Jiangsu Provincial Department of Health; Program for National S & T Major Program [2008ZX10004-011, 2012ZX10004-220]","This study was supported by International Development Research Centre (IDRC), Canada (grant no. 105509-00001002-024), and in part by grants from the National Nature Science Foundation (grant no. 81102173 and 81273192) and the Health Promotion Project, Outstanding Person Fund, Jiangsu Provincial Department of Health (2011).

The causative agent, Orientia tsutsugamushi, is an obligate intracellular bacterium that is transmitted to humans by the bite of a Leptotrombidium mite. Research into the basic mechanisms of cell biology and pathogenicity of O. tsutsugamushi has lagged behind that of other important human pathogens. One reason for this is that O. tsutsugamushi is an obligate intracellular bacterium that can only be cultured in mammalian cells and that requires specific methodologies for propagation and analysis. Here, we have performed a body of work designed to improve methods for quantification, propagation, purification and long-term storage of this important but neglected human pathogen. These results will be useful to other researchers working on O. tsutsugamushi and also other obligate intracellular pathogens such as those in the Rickettsiales and Chlamydiales families. Methodology A clinical isolate of O. tsutsugamushi was grown in cultured mouse embryonic fibroblast (L929) cells. Bacterial growth was measured using an O. tsutsugamushi-specific qPCR assay. Conditions leading to improvements in viability and growth were monitored in terms of the effect on bacterial cell number after growth in cultured mammalian cells. Key results Development of a standardised growth assay to quantify bacterial replication and viability in vitro. Quantitative comparison of different DNA extraction methods. Quantification of the effect on growth of FBS concentration, daunorubicin supplementation, media composition, host cell confluence at infection and frequency of media replacement. Optimisation of bacterial purification including a comparison of host cell lysis methods, purification temperature, bacterial yield calculations and bacterial pelleting at different centrifugation speeds. Quantification of bacterial viability loss after long term storage and freezing under a range of conditions including different freezing buffers and different rates of freezing. Conclusions Here we present a standardised method for comparing the viability of O. tsutsugamushi after purification, treatment and propagation under various conditions. Taken together, we present a body of data to support improved techniques for propagation, purification and storage of this organism. This data will be useful both for improving clinical isolation rates as well as performing in vitro cell biology experiments.","[Giengkam, Suparat; Chaemchuen, Suwittra; Atwal, Sharanjeet; Blacksell, Stuart D.; Paris, Daniel H.; Day, Nicholas P.

This study aimed to investigate the kinetics and dynamics of venom and clotting function in Russell's viper envenoming. Methodology/Principal Findings In a prospective cohort of 146 patients with Russell's viper envenoming, we measured venom concentrations, international normalised ratio [INR], prothrombin time (PT), activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), coagulation factors I, II, V, VII, VIII, IX and X, and von Willebrand factor antigen. The median age was 39y (16-82y) and 111 were male. The median peak INR was 6.8 (interquartile range[IQR]: 3.7 to >13), associated with low fibrinogen [median,<0.01g/L;IQR:<0.01-0.9g/L), low factor V levels [median,<5%;IQR:<5-4%],low factor VIII levels [median, 40%;IQR:12-79%] and low factor X levels [median, 48%;IQR:29-67%]. There were smaller reductions in factors II, IX and VII over time. All factors recovered over 48h post-antivenom. The median INR remained >3 at 6h post-antivenom but had reduced to <2, by 24h. The aPTT had also returned to close to normal (<50sec) at 24h. Factor VII, VIII and IX levels were unusually high pre-antivenom, median peak concentrations of 393%, 307% and 468% respectively.

The parasite has a digenetic life cycle, passing between mammalian hosts and insect vectors, and a series of developmental forms adapted to each life cycle stage. Each point in the life cycle presents radically different challenges to parasite metabolism and physiology and distinct host interactions requiring remodeling of the parasite cell surface. Transcriptomic and proteomic studies of the related parasites T. brucei and T. congolense have shown how gene expression is regulated during their development. New methods for in vitro culture of the T. vivax insect stages have allowed us to describe global gene expression throughout the complete T. vivax life cycle for the first time. We combined transcriptomic and proteomic analysis of each life stage using RNA-seq and mass spectrometry respectively, to identify genes with patterns of preferential transcription or expression. While T. vivax conforms to a pattern of highly conserved gene expression found in other African trypanosomes, (e.g. developmental regulation of energy metabolism, restricted expression of a dominant variant antigen, and expression of 'Fam50' proteins in the insect mouthparts), we identified significant differences in gene expression affecting metabolism in the fly and a suite of T. vivax-specific genes with predicted cell-surface expression that are preferentially expressed in the mammal ('Fam29, 30, 42') or the vector ('Fam34, 35, 43'). T. vivax differs significantly from other African trypanosomes in the developmentally-regulated proteins likely to be expressed on its cell surface and thus, in the structure of the host-parasite interface. These unique features may yet explain the species differences in life cycle and could, in the form of bloodstream-stage proteins that do not undergo antigenic variation, provide targets for therapy.","[Jackson, Andrew P.; Xia, Dong; Wastling, Jonathan M.] Univ Liverpool, Inst Infect & Global Hlth, Dept Infect Biol, Liverpool L69 3BX, Merseyside, England; [Goyard, Sophie; Minoprio, Paola] Inst Pasteur, Dept Infect & Epidemiol, Paris, France; [Foth, Bernardo J.; Sanders, Mandy; Berriman, Matthew] Wellcome Trust Sanger Inst, Pathogen Genom Grp, Cambridge, England","Jackson, AP (reprint author), Univ Liverpool, Inst Infect & Global Hlth, Dept Infect Biol, Liverpool L69 3BX, Merseyside, England.",a.p.jackson@liv.ac.uk,"Berriman, Matthew/A-7618-2011","Berriman, Matthew/0000-0002-9581-0377; Goyard, Sophie/0000-0002-8937-2796; Minoprio, Paola/0000-0002-1659-833X; Jackson, Andrew Paul/0000-0002-5704-8596; Xia, Dong/0000-0003-4571-2776","Wellcome Trust [WT 097826/Z/11/A, WT 098051]","This work was funded by Wellcome Trust (www.wellcometrust.org.uk) Grants WT 097826/Z/11/A and WT 098051.

Arthropod-borne parasites have probably developed mechanisms, largely still unknown, to exploit the vector-vertebrate host interactions to ensure their transmission to suitable hosts. Triatomines exhibit a strong negative phototaxis and nocturnal activity, believed to be important for insect survival against its predators. Methodology/Principal Findings In this study we quantified phototaxis and locomotion in starved fifth instar nymphs of Rhodnius prolixus infected with Trypanosoma cruzi or Trypanosoma rangeli. T. cruzi infection did not alter insect phototaxis, but induced an overall 20% decrease in the number of bug locomotory events. Furthermore, the significant differences induced by this parasite were concentrated at the beginning of the scotophase. Conversely, T. rangeli modified both behaviors, as it significantly decreased bug negative phototaxis, while it induced a 23% increase in the number of locomotory events in infected bugs. In this case, the significant effects were observed during the photophase. We also investigated the expression of Rpfor, the triatomine ortholog of the foraging gene known to modulate locomotion in other insects, and found a 4.8 fold increase for T. rangeli infected insects. Conclusions/Significance We demonstrated for the first time that trypanosome infection modulates the locomotory activity of the invertebrate host. T. rangeli infection seems to be more broadly effective, as besides affecting the intensity of locomotion this parasite also diminished negative phototaxis and the expression of a behavior-associated gene in the triatomine vector.","[Marliere, Newmar Pinto; Latorre-Estivalis, Jose Manuel; Lorenzo, Marcelo Gustavo; Alves-Silva, Juliana; Rodrigues, Juliana de Oliveira; Ferreira, Luciana de Lima; Lara, Luisa de Melo; Guarneri, Alessandra Aparecida] Cent Pesquisas Rene Rachou, Belo Horizonte, MG, Brazil; [Carrasco, David] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Plant Protect Biol, Chem Ecol Grp, Alnarp, Sweden; [Alves-Silva, Juliana] Univ Fed Minas Gerais, Inst Ciencias Biol, Dept Bioquim Imunol, Belo Horizonte, MG, Brazil; [Lowenberger, Carl; Guarneri, Alessandra Aparecida] Simon Fraser Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Burnaby, BC V5A 1S6, Canada","Marliere, NP (reprint author), Cent Pesquisas Rene Rachou, Ave Augusto Lima, Belo Horizonte, MG, Brazil.",guarneri@cpqrr.fiocruz.br,"Lorenzo, Marcelo Gustavo/V-3951-2019; guarneri, Alessandra A/I-4124-2012","Lorenzo, Marcelo Gustavo/0000-0002-4000-5514; Guarneri, Alessandra/0000-0002-9162-2731","Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico [441999/2014-0, 306586/2012-6]; Instituto Nacional de Ciencia e Tecnologia em Entomologia Molecular [573959/2008-0]; NSERC [RPG261940]; Canada Research Chairs program; Programa Estrategico de Apoio a Pesquisa em Saude VI/FIOCRUZ [407614/2012-5]; Programa de Excelencia em Pesquisa [401973/2012-3]","MGL was supported by Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico productivity grants (306586/2012-6).

VL occurring in residents of hill districts is therefore often considered the result of Leishmania donovani infection during travel. Early 2014 we conducted an outbreak investigation in Okhaldhunga and Bhojpur districts in the Nepal hills where increasing number of VL cases have been reported. Methodology/Principal Findings A house-to-house survey in six villages documented retrospectively 35 cases of Visceral Leishmaniasis (VL). Anti-Leishmania antibodies were found in 22/23 past-VL cases, in 40/416 (9.6%) persons without VL and in 12/155 (7.7%) domestic animals. An age-and sex-matched case-control study showed that exposure to known VL-endemic regions was no risk factor for VL, but having a VL case in the neighbourhood was. SSU-rDNA PCR for Leishmania sp. was positive in 24 (5%) of the human, in 18 (12%) of the animal samples and in 16 (14%) bloodfed female Phlebotomus argentipes sand flies. L. donovani was confirmed in two asymptomatic individuals and in one sand fly through hsp70-based sequencing. Conclusions/Significance This is epidemiological and entomological evidence for ongoing local transmission of L. donovani in villages at an altitude above 600 meters in Nepal, in districts considered hitherto non-endemic for VL. The VL Elimination Initiative in Nepal should therefore consider extending its surveillance and control activities in order to assure VL elimination, and the risk map for VL should be redesigned.","[Ostyn, Bart; Tersago, Katrien; Boelaert, Marleen] Inst Trop Med, Dept Publ Heath, B-2000 Antwerp, Belgium; [Uranw, Surendra; Rijal, Suman] BP Koirala Inst Hlth Sci, Dept Internal Med, Dharan, Nepal; [Bhattarai, Narayan Raj; Das, Murari L.; Rai, Keshav] BP Koirala Inst Hlth Sci, Dept Microbiol, Dharan, Nepal; [Pokhrel, Yubraj; Marasini, Baburam] Minist Hlth & Populat MOHP, Epidemiol & Dis Control Div, Kathmandu, Nepal; [Durnez, Lies; Van der Auwera, Gert; Dujardin, Jean-Claude] Inst Trop Med, Dept Biomed Sci, B-2000 Antwerp, Belgium; [Dujardin, Jean-Claude; Coosemans, Marc] Univ Antwerp, Dept Biomed Sci, B-2020 Antwerp, Belgium; [Argaw, Daniel] WHO, Dept Control Neglected Trop Dis, CH-1211 Geneva, Switzerland","Ostyn, B (reprint author), Inst Trop Med, Dept Publ Heath, B-2000 Antwerp, Belgium.",bostyn@itg.be,"Rai, Keshav/Q-1350-2016; Boelaert, Marleen/E-2698-2012","Rai, Keshav/0000-0002-9747-3431; Boelaert, Marleen/0000-0001-8051-6776; Das, Murari/0000-0001-6816-2389","Directorate-General for Development Cooperation [1.16]; ITM; NTD division of WHO-Geneva; Ministry of Sciences of the Flanders region (ITMA/SOFI-B, SINGLE) Department of Economy, Science and Innovation (EWI Department)","This research was funded by the Framework Agreement between ITM and the Directorate-General for Development Cooperation, Project number 1.16 http://diplomatie.belgium.be/nl/Beleid/Ontwikkelingssamenwerking/(MB, JCD), by the NTD division of WHO-Geneva http://www.who.int/neglected_diseases/en/(SU,SR), and by the Ministry of Sciences of the Flanders region (ITMA/SOFI-B, SINGLE) Department of Economy, Science and Innovation (EWI Department) http://www.ewivlaanderen.be/en (MB).

Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted in school-aged children aged 4-18 years in the northeastern region of the State of Minas Gerais (Brazil), where Necator americanus, Ascaris lumbricoides, Trichuris trichiura, and S. mansoni are co-endemic. One fecal sample from each participant was collected and transported to the field laboratory for analysis. Coprological diagnosis was performed on each fecal sample by three different methods: Formalin-Ether Sedimentation (FES), KK and the MM technique. The diagnostic sensitivity and negative predictive value (NPV) of each technique was calculated using the combination of all three techniques as the composite standard. In order to determine the agreement between the three techniques Fleiss' kappa was used. Both the Cure Rate (CR) and the Fecal Egg Count Reduction (FECR) were calculated using the two quantification techniques (i.e., the MM and KK). Results Fecal samples from 1260 children were analyzed. The KK had higher diagnostic sensitivity than the MM for the detection of both A. lumbricoides (KK 97.3%, MM 69.5%) and hookworm (KK 95.1%, MM 80.8%). The CR of a single dose of mebendazole varied significantly between the KK and MM for both A. lumbricoides (p = 0.016) and hookworm (p = 0.000), with lower rates obtained with the KK. On the other hand, the FECR was very similar between both techniques for both A. lumbricoides and hookworm. Conclusion The MM did not add any diagnostic value over the KK in areas where both STHs and trematodes were co-endemic. The lower sensitivity of the MM would have an important impact on the administration of selective school-based treatment in this area since if only the MM were used, 36 (13.9%) children diagnosed with A. lumbricoides would have gone untreated.","[Periago, Maria V.; Diniz, Renata C.; Pinto, Simone A.; Correa-Oliveira, Rodrigo] Fundacao Oswaldo Cruz, Cent Pesquisa Rene Rachou, Lab Imunol Celular & Mol, Belo Horizonte, MG, Brazil; [Yakovleva, Anna; Diemert, David J.; Bethony, Jeffrey M.] George Washington Univ, Sch Med & Hlth Sci, Res Ctr Neglected Dis Poverty, Washington, DC 20052 USA; [Yakovleva, Anna; Diemert, David J.; Bethony, Jeffrey M.] George Washington Univ, Sch Med & Hlth Sci, Dept Microbiol Immunol & Trop Med, Washington, DC 20052 USA","Periago, MV (reprint author), Fundacao Oswaldo Cruz, Cent Pesquisa Rene Rachou, Lab Imunol Celular & Mol, Belo Horizonte, MG, Brazil.",,,"Correa-Oliveira, Rodrigo/0000-0001-6419-9459; Periago, Maria Victoria/0000-0002-1470-5146; Diemert, David/0000-0002-2789-0512",Sabin Vaccine Institute [20050-10],"This study was funded with Grant#20050-10 from the Sabin Vaccine Institute.

A better understanding of the transcriptional basis for this acquired immunological response may provide insight into how the immune system can be boosted during vaccination, and into why infected individuals differ in symptomology. Methodology/Principal Findings Peripheral blood gene expression profiles of 9 semi-immune volunteers from a Plasmodium vivax malaria prevalent region (Buenaventura, Colombia) were compared to those of 7 naive individuals from a region with no reported transmission of malaria (Cali, Colombia) after a controlled infection mosquito bite challenge with P. vivax. A Fluidigm nanoscale quantitative RT-PCR array was used to survey altered expression of 96 blood informative transcripts at 7 timepoints after controlled infection, and RNASeq was used to contrast pre-infection and early parasitemia timepoints. There was no evidence for transcriptional changes prior to the appearance of blood stage parasites at day 12 or 13, at which time there was a strong interferon response and, unexpectedly, down-regulation of transcripts related to inflammation and innate immunity. This differential expression was confirmed with RNASeq, which also suggested perturbations of aspects of T cell function and erythropoiesis. Despite differences in clinical symptoms between the semi-immune and malaria naive individuals, only subtle differences in their transcriptomes were observed, although 175 genes showed significantly greater induction or repression in the naive volunteers from Cali. Conclusion/Significance Gene expression profiling of whole blood reveals the type and duration of the immune response to P. vivax infection, and highlights a subset of genes that may mediate adaptive immunity.","[Rojas-Pena, Monica L.; Gibson, Greg] Georgia Inst Technol, Sch Biol, Ctr Integrat Genom, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA; [Vallejo, Andres; Herrera, Socrates; Arevalo-Herrera, Myriam] CSRC, Cali, Colombia; [Arevalo-Herrera, Myriam] Univ Valle, Sch Hlth, Cali, Colombia","Rojas-Pena, ML (reprint author), Georgia Inst Technol, Sch Biol, Ctr Integrat Genom, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA.",greg.gibson@biology.gatech.edu,,"Arevalo, Myriam/0000-0002-3434-9425; Vallejo, Andres Felipe/0000-0002-4688-0598","National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI) [5R01HL086488]; Colombian government (COLCIENCIAS) [527, 529]; MLRP; GG [1-P01-GM0996568]","The clinical trial was supported by the ROI research project award from the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI, grant 5R01HL086488), and the Colombian government (COLCIENCIAS contracts: 527 and 529 year 2009) supported the vaccine study in Colombia.

Limited access to health care and the disease's non-specific symptoms mean that many patients are undiagnosed and untreated, but the mortality from untreated scrub typhus is unknown. This review systematically summarizes the literature on the untreated mortality from scrub typhus and disease outcomes. Methodology/Principal Findings A literature search was performed to identify patient series containing untreated patients. Patients were included if they were symptomatic and had a clinical or laboratory diagnosis of scrub typhus and excluded if they were treated with antibiotics. The primary outcome was mortality from untreated scrub typhus and secondary outcomes were total days of fever, clinical symptoms, and laboratory results. A total of 76 studies containing 89 patient series and 19,644 patients were included in the final analysis. The median mortality of all patient series was 6.0% with a wide range (min-max) of 0-70%. Many studies used clinical diagnosis alone and had incomplete data on secondary outcomes. Mortality varied by location and increased with age and in patients with myocarditis, delirium, pneumonitis, or signs of hemorrhage, but not according to sex or the presence of an eschar or meningitis. Duration of fever was shown to be long (median 14.4 days Range (9-19)). Conclusions Results show that the untreated mortality from scrub typhus appears lower than previously reported estimates. More data are required to clarify mortality according to location and host factors, clinical syndromes including myocarditis and central nervous system disease, and in vulnerable mother-child populations. Increased surveillance and improved access to diagnostic tests are required to accurately estimate the untreated mortality of scrub typhus. This information would facilitate reliable quantification of DALYs and guide empirical treatment strategies.","[Taylor, Andrew J.; Paris, Daniel H.; Newton, Paul N.] Mahosot Hosp, Microbiol Lab, Lao Oxford Mahosot Hosp Wellcome Trust Res Unit L, Viangchan, Laos; [Taylor, Andrew J.; Paris, Daniel H.; Newton, Paul N.] Univ Oxford, Nuffield Dept Clin Med, Ctr Trop Med & Global Hlth, Churchill Hosp, Oxford, England; [Paris, Daniel H.] Mahidol Univ, Mahidol Oxford Res Unit, Fac Trop Med, Bangkok 10700, Thailand","Taylor, AJ (reprint author), Mahosot Hosp, Microbiol Lab, Lao Oxford Mahosot Hosp Wellcome Trust Res Unit L, Viangchan, Laos.",Andrewtaylor9@gmail.com,,,Wellcome Trust,,,34,63,65,0,7,PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE,SAN FRANCISCO,"1160 BATTERY STREET, STE 100, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94111 USA",1935-2735,,,PLOS NEGLECT TROP D,Plos Neglect.

Vector control is capable of completely interrupting HAT transmission but is not used because it is considered too expensive and difficult to organise in resource-poor settings. We conducted a full scale field trial of a refined vector control technology to determine its utility in control of Gambian HAT. Methods and Findings The major vector of Gambian HAT is the tsetse fly Glossina fuscipes which lives in the humid zone immediately adjacent to water bodies. From a series of preliminary trials we determined the number of tiny targets required to reduce G. fuscipes populations by more than 90%. Using these data for model calibration we predicted we needed a target density of 20 per linear km of river in riverine savannah to achieve >90% tsetse control. We then carried out a full scale, 500 km(2) field trial covering two HAT foci in Northern Uganda to determine the efficacy of tiny targets (overall target density 5.7/km(2)). In 12 months, tsetse populations declined by more than 90%. As a guide we used a published HAT transmission model and calculated that a 72% reduction in tsetse population is required to stop transmission in those settings. Interpretation The Ugandan census suggests population density in the HAT foci is approximately 500 per km2. The estimated cost for a single round of active case detection (excluding treatment), covering 80% of the population, is US$433,333 (WHO figures). One year of vector control organised within the country, which can completely stop HAT transmission, would cost US$42,700. The case for adding this method of vector control to case detection and treatment is strong. We outline how such a component could be organised.","[Tirados, Inaki; Esterhuizen, Johan; Kovacic, Vanja; Hastings, Ian; Lehane, Michael J.; Torr, Steve J.] Univ Liverpool, Liverpool Sch Trop Med, Liverpool L3 5QA, Merseyside, England; [Mangwiro, T.

Although the epidemiological evidence links clonorchiasis and CCA, the underlying molecular mechanism involved in this process is poorly understood. In the present study, we investigated expression of oncogenes and tumor suppressors, including PSMD10, CDK4, p53 and RB in C. sinensis induced hamster CCA model. Methods Different histochemical/immunohistochemical techniques were performed to detect CCA in 4 groups of hamsters: uninfected control (Ctrl.), infected with C. sinensis (Cs), ingested Nnitrosodimethylamine (NDMA), and both Cs infected and NDMA introduced (Cs+NDMA). The liver tissues from all groups were analyzed for gene/protein expressions by quantitative PCR (qPCR) and western blotting. Principal Findings CCA was observed in all hamsters of Cs+ NDMA group with well, moderate, and poorly differentiated types measured in 21.8% +/- 1.5%, 13.3%+/- 1.3%, and 10.8% +/- 1.3% of total tissue section areas respectively. All CCA differentiations progressed in a time dependent manner, starting from the 8th week of infection. CCA stroma was characterized with increased collagen type I, mucin, and proliferative cell nuclear antigen (PCNA). The qPCR analysis showed PSMD10, CDK4 and p16INK4 were over-expressed, whereas p53 was under-expressed in the Cs+ NDMA group. We observed no change in RB1 at mRNA level but found significant down-regulation of RB protein. The apoptosis related genes, BAX and caspase 9 were found downregulated in the CCA tissue. Gene/protein expressions were matched well with the pathological changes of different groups except the NDMA group. Though the hamsters in the NDMA group showed no marked pathological lesions, we observed over-expression of Akt/PKB and p53 genes proposing molecular interplay in this group which might be related to the CCA initiation in this animal model. Conclusions/Significance The present findings suggest that oncogenes, PSMD10 and CDK4, and tumor suppressors, p53 and RB, are involved in the carcinogenesis process of C. sinensis induced CCA in hamsters.","[Uddin, Md.

However, psychological support is rarely provided to victims. Aim To assess the effectiveness of a brief intervention which can be provided by non-specialist doctors aimed at reducing psychological morbidity following snakebite envenoming. Method In a single blind, randomized controlled trial, snakebite victims with systemic envenoming [n = 225, 168 males, mean age 42.1 (SD 12.4) years] were randomized into three arms. One arm received no intervention (n = 68, Group A), the second received psychological first aid and psychoeducation (dispelling prevalent cultural beliefs related to snakebite which promote development of a sick role) at discharge from hospital (n = 65, Group B), while the third received psychological first aid and psychoeducation at discharge and a second intervention one month later based on cognitive behavioural principles (n = 69, Group C). All patients were assessed six months after hospital discharge for the presence of psychological symptoms and level of functioning using standardized tools. Results At six months, there was a decreasing trend in the proportion of patients who were positive for psychiatric symptoms of depression and anxiety from Group A through Group B to Group C (Chi square test for trend = 7.901, p = 0.005). This was mainly due to a decreasing trend for symptoms of anxiety (chi-square for trend = 11.256, p = 0.001). There was also decreasing trend in the overall prevalence of disability from Group A through Group B to Group C (chi square for trend = 7.551, p = 0.006), predominantly in relation to disability in family life (p = 0.006) and social life (p = 0.005). However, there was no difference in the proportion of patients diagnosed with depression between the three groups (chi square for trend = 0.391, p = 0.532), and the intervention also had no effect on post-traumatic stress disorder. Conclusions A brief psychological intervention, which included psychological first aid and psychoeducation plus cognitive behavioural therapy that can be provided by non-specialist doctors appeared to reduce psychiatric symptoms and disability after snakebite envenoming, but not depression or post-traumatic stress disorder.","[Wijesinghe, Chamara A.; Williams, Shehan S.; Kasturiratne, Anuradhani; Wijewickrema, Buddhika; Jayamanne, Shaluka F.; de Silva, H.

Components of tsetse saliva (sialome) are introduced into the mammalian host bite site during the blood feeding process and are important for tsetse's ability to feed efficiently, but can also influence disease transmission and serve as biomarkers for host exposure. We compared the sialome components from four tsetse species in two subgenera: subgenus Morsitans: Glossina morsitans morsitans (Gmm) and Glossina pallidipes (Gpd), and subgenus Palpalis: Glossina palpalis gambiensis (Gpg) and Glossina fuscipes fuscipes (Gff), and evaluated their immunogenicity and serological cross reactivity by an immunoblot approach utilizing antibodies from experimental mice challenged with uninfected flies. The protein and immune profiles of sialome components varied with fly species in the same subgenus displaying greater similarity and cross reactivity. Sera obtained from cattle from disease endemic areas of Africa displayed an immunogenicity profile reflective of tsetse species distribution. We analyzed the sialome fractions of Gmm by LC-MS/MS, and identified TAg5, Tsal1/Tsal2, and Sgp3 as major immunogenic proteins, and the 5'-nucleotidase family as well as four members of the Adenosine Deaminase Growth Factor (ADGF) family as the major non-immunogenic proteins. Within the ADGF family, we identified four closely related proteins (TSGF-1, TSGF-2, ADGF-3 and ADGF-4), all of which are expressed in tsetse salivary glands. We describe the tsetse species-specific expression profiles and genomic localization of these proteins. Using a passive-immunity approach, we evaluated the effects of rec-TSGF (TSGF-1 and TSGF-2) polyclonal antibodies on tsetse fitness parameters. Limited exposure of tsetse to mice with circulating anti-TSGF antibodies resulted in a slight detriment to their blood feeding ability as reflected by compromised digestion, lower weight gain and less total lipid reserves although these results were not statistically significant. Long-term exposure studies of tsetse flies to antibodies corresponding to the ADGF family of proteins are warranted to evaluate the role of this conserved family in fly biology.","[Zhao, Xin; Silva, Thiago Luiz Alves E.; Cronin, Laura; Savage, Amy F.; O'Neill, Michelle; Aksoy, Serap] Yale Univ, Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Epidemiol Microbial Dis, New Haven, CT USA; [Nerima, Barbara; Okedi, Loyce M.] Natl Livestock Resources Inst, Tororo, Uganda","Zhao, X (reprint author), Chinese Acad Sci, Ctr Influenza Res & Early Warning, Beijing, Peoples R China.",serap.aksoy@yale.edu,"O'Neill, Michelle B/Q-6824-2017; Silva, Thiago/L-7699-2016; Aksoy, Serap/K-2244-2019","O'Neill, Michelle B/0000-0002-2079-4122; Silva, Thiago/0000-0002-8520-5405; Aksoy, Serap/0000-0001-9941-143X",NIH [AI051584]; Li Foundation; Ambrose Monell Foundation; Brazilian funding agency Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPq),"This study received support from NIH AI051584, Li Foundation and Ambrose Monell Foundation awards to SA.

Protection against cholera is serogroup specific. Serogroup specificity is defined by the O-specific polysaccharide (OSP) component of lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Methodology Here we describe a conjugate vaccine for cholera prepared via squaric acid chemistry from the OSP of V. cholerae O1 Inaba strain PIC018 and a recombinant heavy chain fragment of tetanus toxin (OSP:rTTHc). We assessed a range of vaccine doses based on the OSP content of the vaccine (10-50 mu g), vaccine compositions varying by molar loading ratio of OSP to rTTHc (3:1, 5:1, 10:1), effect of an adjuvant, and route of immunization. Principle Findings Immunized mice developed prominent anti-OSP and anti-TT serum IgG responses, as well as vibriocidal antibody and memory B cell responses following intramuscular or intradermal vaccination. Mice did not develop anti-squarate responses. Intestinal lamina proprial IgA responses targeting OSP occurred following intradermal vaccination. In general, we found comparable immune responses in mice immunized with these variations, although memory B cell and vibriocidal responses were blunted in mice receiving the highest dose of vaccine (50 mu g). We found no appreciable change in immune responses when the conjugate vaccine was administered in the presence or absence of immunoadjuvant alum. Administration of OSP:rTTHc resulted in 55% protective efficacy in a mouse survival cholera challenge model. Conclusion We report development of an Inaba OSP:rTTHc conjugate vaccine that induces memory responses and protection against cholera in mice. Development of an effective cholera conjugate vaccine that induces high level and long-term immune responses against OSP would be beneficial, especially in young children who respond poorly to polysaccharide antigens.","[Abu Sayeed, Md.; Bufano, Meagan Kelly; Alam, Mohammad Murshid; Sultana, Tania; Rashu, Md.

However the magnitude and possible interactions of these infections remain poorly understood. This study determined the prevalence, impact and possible interaction of Plasmodium falciparum and intestinal helminths co-infection among school children in rural communities of Kwara State, Nigeria. Methods Blood, urine and stool samples were collected from 1017 primary school pupils of ages 4-15 years. Stool samples were processed using both Kato-Katz and formol-ether concentration techniques and microscopically examined for intestinal helminths infection. Urine samples were analyzed using sedimentation method for Schistosoma haematobium. Plasmodium falciparum was confirmed by microscopy using thick and thin blood films methods and packed cell volume (PCV) was determined using hematocrit reader. Univariate analysis and chi-square statistical tests were used to analyze the data. Results Overall, 61.2% of all school children had at least an infection of either P. falciparum, S. haematobium, or intestinal helminth. S. haematobium accounted for the largest proportion (44.4%) of a single infection followed by P. falciparum (20.6%). The prevalence of malaria and helminth co-infection in the study was 14.4%. Four species of intestinal helminths were recovered from the stool samples and these were hookworm (22.5%), Hymenolepis species (9.8%), Schistosoma mansoni (2.9%) and Enterobius vermicularis (0.6%). The mean densities of P. falciparum in children co-infected with S. haematobium and hookworm were higher compared to those infected with P. falciparum only though not statistically significant (p = 0.062). The age distribution of both S. haematobium (p = 0.049) and hookworm (p = 0.034) infected children were statistically significant with the older age group (10-15 years) recording the highest prevalence of 47.2% and 25% respectively. Children who were infected with S. haematobium (RR = 1.3) and hookworm (RR = 1.4) have equal chances of being infected with P. falciparum as children with no worm infection. On the other hand children infected with Hymenolepis spp. (p<0.0001) are more likely to be infected with P. falciparum than Hymenolepis spp. uninfected children (RR = 2.0) Conclusions These findings suggest that multiple parasitic infections are common in school age children in rural communities of Kwara State Nigeria. The Hymenolepis spp. induced increase susceptibility to P. falciparum could have important consequences on how concurrent infections affect the expression or pathogenesis of these infections.","[Adedoja, Ayodele; Tijani, Bukola Deborah; Adeyeba, Oluwaseyi A.; Ojurongbe, Olusola] Ladoke Akintola Univ Technol, Dept Med Microbiol & Parasitol, Osogbo, Nigeria; [Adedoja, Ayodele; Tijani, Bukola Deborah] Univ Ilorin, Teaching Hosp, Dept Med Microbiol & Parasitol, Ilorin, Nigeria; [Akanbi, Ajibola A., II] Univ Ilorin, Dept Med Microbiol & Parasitol, Ilorin, Nigeria; [Ojurongbe, Taiwo A.] Osun State Univ, Dept Math & Phys Sci, Osogbo, Nigeria","Ojurongbe, O (reprint author), Ladoke Akintola Univ Technol, Dept Med Microbiol & Parasitol, Osogbo, Nigeria.",oojurongbe@lautech.edu.ng,,,,,,44,9,9,1,21,PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE,SAN FRANCISCO,"1160 BATTERY STREET, STE 100, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94111 USA",1935-2735,,,PLOS NEGLECT TROP D,Plos Neglect.

Medical archives in nine major hospitals in Palestine were reviewed to determine incidence of E. granulosus infection detected in humans during surgery. Faecal samples were collected from 93 domestic dogs in three districts with the highest number of human cases: Al-Khalil (Hebron), Tubas and Jenin. Genomic DNA was extracted from dog faecal samples and amplified by PCR targeting the repeat DNA sequence (EgG1 Hae III) followed by sequencing of five positive samples. Genotyping was determined by sequencing and BLAST searching of mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit (CO1). The incidence of E. granulosus infection detected in humans at surgery was 1.2 per 100,000 in the West Bank and 1.0 per 100,000 in Gaza Strip. Seventeen of 93 domestic dogs (18%) were positive, based upon comparison with the Echinococcus DNA control. The five sequenced samples were confirmed to be E. granulosus. Successfully genotyped sample belonged to E. granulosus sensu stricto (formerly G1-G3 complex, sheep strain). For domestic dogs, age group (13-24 months) and sex were identified as two risk factors for contracting E. granulosus. The study identified the high incidence of E. granulosus sensu stricto in dogs in Palestine.","[Al-Jawabreh, Amer; Dumaidi, Kamal] Arab Amer Univ Jenin, Jenin, Israel; [Al-Jawabreh, Amer; Nasereddin, Abedelmajeed; Al-Jawabreh, Hanan; Abdeen, Ziad] Al Quds Publ Hlth Soc, Jerusalem, Israel; [Ereqat, Suheir; Azmi, Kifaya] Al Quds Univ, Fac Med, Dept Biochem & Mol Biol, East Jerusalem, Abu Deis, Israel; [Ereqat, Suheir; Abdeen, Ziad] Al Quds Univ, Al Quds Nutr & Hlth Res Inst, East Jerusalem, Israel; [Al-Laham, Nahed] Al Azhar Univ Gaza, Fac Appl Med Sci, Dept Lab Med, Gaza, Israel","Al-Jawabreh, A (reprint author), Arab Amer Univ Jenin, Jenin, Israel.",islahjr@yahoo.com,"Nasereddin, Abedelmajeed/N-4150-2017; Nasereddin, Abedelmajeed/N-4743-2019; Al-Jawabreh, Amer/I-9960-2019","Nasereddin, Abedelmajeed/0000-0001-8162-420X; Nasereddin, Abedelmajeed/0000-0001-8162-420X; Dumaidi, Kamal/0000-0002-7299-9736; Al-Jawabreh, Amer/0000-0001-5929-8743","Arab American University in Jenin-Palestine [2013-104]; Netherlands Ministry of Foreign Affairs, The Hague, The Netherlands; NVHU [2014.52146]","We thank the Arab American University in Jenin-Palestine for the fund received under grant number 2013-104, cycle 2.

Researchers working on Schistosoma in Africa have described the relationship between the parasites and their snail intermediate hosts as coevolved or even as an evolutionary arms race. In the present study this hypothesis of coevolution is evaluated for S. japonicum and O. hupensis. The origins and radiation of the snails and the parasite across China, and the taxonomic validity of the sub-species of O. hupensis, are also assessed. Methodology/Principal Findings The findings provide no evidence for coevolution between S. japonicum and O. hupensis, and the phylogeographical analysis suggests a heterochronous radiation of the parasites and snails in response to different palaeogeographical and climatic triggers. The results are consistent with a hypothesis of East to West colonisation of China by Oncomelania with a re-invasion of Japan by O. hupensis from China. The Taiwan population of S. japonicum appears to be recently established in comparison with mainland Chinese populations. Conclusions/Significance The snail and parasite populations of the western mountain region of China (Yunnan and Sichuan) appear to have been isolated from Southeast Asian populations since the Pleistocene; this has implications for road and rail links being constructed in the region, which will breach biogeographical barriers between China and Southeast Asia. The results also have implications for the spread of S. japonicum. In the absence of coevolution, the parasite may more readily colonise new snail populations to which it is not locally adapted, or even new intermediate host species; this can facilitate its dispersal into new areas. Additional work is required to assess further the risk of spread of S. japonicum.","[Attwood, Stephen W.] Sichuan Univ, West China Med Sch, West China Hosp, State Key Lab Biotherapy, Chengdu 610064, Peoples R China; [Attwood, Stephen W.] Nat Hist Museum, Dept Life Sci, London SW7 5BD, England; [Ibaraki, Motomu] Ohio State Univ, Sch Earth Sci, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [Saitoh, Yasuhide] Tokyo Med & Dent Univ, Dept Environm Parasitol, Tokyo, Japan; [Nihei, Naoko] Azabu Univ, Sch Vet Med, Parasitol Lab, Sagamihara, Kanagawa, Japan; [Nihei, Naoko] Natl Inst Infect Dis, Dept Med Entomol, Tokyo, Japan; [Janies, Daniel A.] Univ N Carolina, Bioinformat & Genom, Charlotte, NC 28223 USA","Attwood, SW (reprint author), Sichuan Univ, West China Med Sch, West China Hosp, State Key Lab Biotherapy, Chengdu 610064, Peoples R China.",swahuaxi@yahoo.com,"Attwood, Stephen W./B-1685-2010","Attwood, Stephen W./0000-0003-1717-1677",,,,83,13,16,2,18,PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE,SAN FRANCISCO,"1160 BATTERY STREET, STE 100, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94111 USA",1935-2735,,,PLOS NEGLECT TROP D,Plos Neglect.

It is a viral disease primarily affecting mammals, though all warm blooded animals are susceptible. Experimental rabies virus infection in birds has been reported, but naturally occurring infection of birds has been documented very rarely. Principal Findings The carcass of a domestic fowl (Gallus domesticus), which had been bitten by a stray dog one month back, was brought to the rabies diagnostic laboratory. A necropsy was performed and the brain tissue obtained was subjected to laboratory tests for rabies. The brain tissue was positive for rabies viral antigens by fluorescent antibody test (FAT) confirming a diagnosis of rabies. Phylogenetic analysis based on nucleoprotein gene sequencing revealed that the rabies virus strain from the domestic fowl belonged to a distinct and relatively rare Indian subcontinent lineage. Significance This case of naturally acquired rabies infection in a bird species, Gallus domesticus, being reported for the first time in India, was identified from an area which has a significant stray dog population and is highly endemic for canine rabies. It indicates that spill over of infection even to an unusual host is possible in highly endemic areas. Lack of any clinical signs, and fewer opportunities for diagnostic laboratory testing of suspected rabies in birds, may be the reason for disease in these species being undiagnosed and probably under-reported. Butchering and handling of rabies virus-infected poultry may pose a potential exposure risk.","[Baby, Julie; Abraham, Swapna Susan; Thankappan, Asha T.; Pillai, Prasad Madhavan] Chief Dis Invest Off, Dept Anim Husb, Kochi, Kerala, India; [Mani, Reeta Subramaniam; Anand, Ashwini Manoor; Madhusudana, Shampur Narayan] Natl Inst Mental Hlth & Neurosci, Dept Neurovirol, WHO Collaborating Ctr Reference & Res Rabies, Bangalore 560029, Karnataka, India; [Ramachandran, Jayachandran; Sreekumar, Sachin] Vet Hosp, Thiruvananthapuram, Kerala, India","Madhusudana, SN (reprint author), Natl Inst Mental Hlth & Neurosci, Dept Neurovirol, WHO Collaborating Ctr Reference & Res Rabies, Bangalore 560029, Karnataka, India.",mshampur@hotmail.com,,"Mani, Reeta/0000-0001-6039-1187",,,,17,3,3,0,14,PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE,SAN FRANCISCO,"1160 BATTERY STREET, STE 100, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94111 USA",1935-2735,,,PLOS NEGLECT TROP D,Plos Neglect.

To achieve the goal annual mass drug administration (MDA) with diethylcarbamazine (DEC) plus albendazole (ABZ) has been introduced in all endemic countries. The current policy however excludes pregnant mothers and children below two years of age from MDA. Since pregnancy and early childhood are critical periods in determining the disease outcome in older age, the present study was undertaken to find out the influence of maternal filarial infection at the time of pregnancy on the susceptibility outcome of children born in a community after implementation of MDA for the first time. Methodology and Principal Findings The participants in this cohort consists of pregnant mothers and their subsequently born children living in eight adjacent villages endemic for filarial infections, in Khurda District, Odisha, India, where MDA has reduced microfilariae (Mf) rate from 12% to 0.34%. Infection status of mother and their children were assessed by detection of Mf as well as circulating filarial antigen (CFA) assay. The present study reveals a high rate of acquiring filarial infection by the children born to infected mother than uninfected mothers even though Mf rate has come down to < 1% after implementation of ten rounds of MDA. Significance To attain the target of eliminating lymphatic filariasis the current MDA programme should give emphasis on covering the women of child bearing age. Our study recommends incorporating supervised MDA to Adolescent Reproductive and Sexual Health Programme (ARSH) to make the adolescent girls free from infection by the time of pregnancy so as to achieve the goal.","[Bal, Madhusmita; Sahu, Prakash K.; Mandal, Nityananda; Satapathy, Ashok K.; Ranjit, Manoranjan; Kar, Shatanu K.] Indian Council Med Res, Reg Med Res Ctr, Div Immunol, Bhubaneswar, Orissa, India","Bal, M (reprint author), Indian Council Med Res, Reg Med Res Ctr, Div Immunol, Bhubaneswar, Orissa, India.",balmadhusmita@gmail.com,,,"Indian Council of Medical Research, New Delhi, India","This study was funded by Indian Council of Medical Research, New Delhi, India.

Findings Dynamometry performance of the patients' most affected hand (MAH), was worse than that of the less affected hand (LAH) and of healthy controls participants (p = 0.031), confirming handgrip impairment. Motor threshold (MT) of the FDS muscle was higher in both hemispheres in patients as compared to controls, and lower in the hemisphere contralateral to the MAH when compared to that of the LAH. Moreover, motor evoked potential ( MEP) amplitudes collected in the FDS of the MAH were higher in comparison to those of controls. Strikingly, MEPs in the intrinsic hand muscle FDI had lower amplitudes in the hemisphere contralateral to MAH as compared to those of the LAH and the control group. Taken together, these results are suggestive of a more robust representation of an extrinsic hand flexor and impaired intrinsic hand muscle function in the hemisphere contralateral to the MAH due to leprosy. Conclusion Decreased sensory-motor function induced by leprosy affects handgrip muscle representation in M1.","[Batista e Sa, Vagner Wilian] Univ Castelo Branco, Nucleo Pesquisas Fisioterapia, Rio De Janeiro, RJ, Brazil; [Batista e Sa, Vagner Wilian; Gomes, Maria Katia; Sanchez, Tiago Arruda; Moreira, Filipe Azaline; Souto, Inaiacy Bittencourt; Ledo Alves da Cunha, Antonio Jose; Fontana, Ana Paula] Univ Fed Rio de Janeiro, Hosp Univ Clementino Fraga Filho, Programa Posgrad Clin Med, Rio De Janeiro, RJ, Brazil; [Batista e Sa, Vagner Wilian; Gomes, Maria Katia; Sanchez, Tiago Arruda; Moreira, Filipe Azaline; Souto, Inaiacy Bittencourt; Ledo Alves da Cunha, Antonio Jose; Fontana, Ana Paula] Univ Fed Rio de Janeiro, Fac Med, Dept Med Familia & Comunidade, Rio De Janeiro, RJ, Brazil; [Batista e Sa, Vagner Wilian; Rangel, Maria Luiza Sales; Hoefle, Sebastian; Vargas, Claudia Domingues] Univ Fed Rio de Janeiro, Inst Biofis Carlos Chagas Filho, Lab Neurobiol 2, Rio De Janeiro, RJ, Brazil; [Hoefle, Sebastian] DOr Inst Res & Educ, Cognit & Behav Neurosci Unit, Rio De Janeiro, RJ, Brazil; [Hoefle, Sebastian] DOr Inst Res & Educ, Neuroinformat Workgrp, Rio De Janeiro, RJ, Brazil; [Vargas, Claudia Domingues] Univ Fed Rio de Janeiro, Inst Neurol Deolindo Couto, Rio De Janeiro, RJ, Brazil","Sa, VWBE (reprint author), Univ Castelo Branco, Nucleo Pesquisas Fisioterapia, Rio De Janeiro, RJ, Brazil.",vagner.neuro@gmail.com; cdvargas@biof.ufrj.br,"Sanchez, Tiago/Q-7253-2017; da Cunha, Antonio Jose Ledo Alves/O-5914-2019","Sanchez, Tiago/0000-0002-2853-1490; da Cunha, Antonio Jose Ledo Alves/0000-0003-3592-1849","Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e tecnologico CNPq [306817/2014-4, 480108/2012-9]; Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado do Rio de Janeiro FAPERJ [E26/110.526/2012, E-26/102.931/2011]; Financiadora de Estudos e projetos FINEP (PROINFRA HOSPITALAR grant) [18.569-8]; Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo FAPESP's Research, Innovation and Dissemination Center for Neuromathematics-NeuroMat (FAPESP) [2013/07699-0]; Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES)","This work was funded by Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e tecnologico CNPq (grant numbers 306817/2014-4 and 480108/2012-9).

Novel tools for early diagnosis and surveillance of schistosomiasis are currently needed. Elevated levels of circulating microRNAs (miRNAs) are commonly associated with the initiation and progression of human disease pathology. Hence, serum miRNAs are emerging as promising biomarkers for the diagnosis of a variety of human diseases. This study investigated circulating host miRNAs commonly associated with liver diseases and schistosome parasite-derived miRNAs during the progression of hepatic schistosomiasis japonica in two murine models. Methodology/Principal Findings Two mouse strains (C57BL/6 and BALB/c) were infected with a low dosage of Schistosoma japonicum cercariae. The dynamic patterns of hepatopathology, the serum levels of liver injury-related enzymes and the serum circulating miRNAs (both host and parasite-derived) levels were then assessed in the progression of schistosomiasis japonica. For the first time, an inverse correlation between the severity of hepatocyte necrosis and the level of liver fibrosis was revealed during S. japonicum infection in BALB/c, but not in C57BL/6 mice. The inconsistent levels of the host circulating miRNAs, miR-122, miR-21 and miR-34a in serum were confirmed in the two murine models during infection, which limits their potential value as individual diagnostic biomarkers for schistosomiasis. However, their serum levels in combination may serve as a novel biomarker to mirror the hepatic immune responses induced in the mammalian host during schistosome infection and the degree of hepatopathology. Further, two circulating parasite-specific miRNAs, sja-miR-277 and sja-miR3479-3p, were shown to have potential as diagnostic markers for schistosomiasis japonica. Conclusions/Significance We provide the first evidence for the potential of utilizing circulating host miRNAs to indicate different immune responses and the severity of hepatopathology outcomes induced in two murine strains infected with S. japonicum. This study also establishes a basis for the early and cell-free diagnosis of schistosomiasis by targeting circulating schistosome parasite-derived miRNAs.","[Cai, Pengfei; Gobert, Geoffrey N.; You, Hong; Duke, Mary; McManus, Donald P.] QIMR Berghofer Med Res Inst, Mol Parasitol Lab, Brisbane, Qld, Australia","Cai, PF (reprint author), QIMR Berghofer Med Res Inst, Mol Parasitol Lab, Brisbane, Qld, Australia.",Pengfei.Cai@qimrberghofer.edu.au; Don.McManus@qimrberghofer.edu.au,"Gobert, Geoffrey/V-2985-2019","Gobert, Geoffrey/0000-0001-5884-6453","National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) of Australia [APP1002245, APP1037304]","This research was funded by the National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) of Australia (ID APP1002245 and ID APP1037304).

Investigation of the proteins present in this surface layer and the immune responses elicited by them during infection is crucial to our understanding of host/parasite interactions. Recent studies have revealed a number of novel tegumental surface proteins including three (SmCD59a, SmCD59b and Sm29) containing uPAR/Ly6 domains (renamed SmLy6A SmLy6B and SmLy6D in this study). While vaccination with SmLy6A (SmCD59a) and SmLy6D (Sm29) induces protective immunity in experimental models, human immunoglobulin responses to representative SmLy6 family members have yet to be thoroughly explored. Methodology/Principal Findings Using a PSI-BLAST-based search, we present a comprehensive reanalysis of the Schistosoma mansoni Ly6 family (SmLy6A-K). Our examination extends the number of members to eleven (including three novel proteins) and provides strong evidence that the previously identified vaccine candidate Sm29 (renamed SmLy6D) is a unique double uPAR/Ly6 domain-containing representative. Presence of canonical cysteine residues, signal peptides and GPI-anchor sites strongly suggest that all SmLy6 proteins are cell surface-bound. To provide evidence that SmLy6 members are immunogenic in human populations, we report IgG(1) (as well as IgG(4) and IgE) responses against two surface-bound representatives (SmLy6A and SmLy6B) within a cohort of S. mansoni-infected Ugandan males before and after praziquantel treatment. While pre-treatment IgG(1) prevalence for SmLy6A and SmLy6B differs amongst the studied population (7.4% and 25.3% of the cohort, respectively), these values are both higher than IgG(1) prevalence (2.7%) for a sub-surface tegumental antigen, SmTAL1. Further, post-treatment IgG(1) levels against surface-associated SmLy6A and SmLy6B significantly drop (p = 0.020 and p < 0.001, respectively) when compared to rising IgG(1) levels against sub-surface SmTAL1. Conclusions/Significance Collectively, these results expand the number of SmLy6 proteins found within S. mansoni and specifically demonstrate that surface-associated SmLy6A and SmLy6B elicit immunological responses during infection in endemic communities.","[Chalmers, Iain W.; Brown, Martha; Fernandez-Fuentes, Narcis; Hoffmann, Karl F.] Aberystwyth Univ, Inst Biol Environm & Rural Sci, Aberystwyth, Dyfed, Wales; [Fitzsimmons, Colin M.; Jones, Frances M.; Wawrzyniak, Jakub M.; Dunne, David W.] Univ Cambridge, Dept Pathol, Cambridge CB2 1QP, England; [Pierrot, Christine; Khalife, Jamal] Inst Pasteur, Ctr Infect & Immunite Lille, Inserm U1019, UMR CNRS 8204, F-59019 Lille, France; [Tukahebwa, Edridah M.] Ugandan Minist Hlth, Vector Control Div, Kampala, Uganda","Chalmers, IW (reprint author), Aberystwyth Univ, Inst Biol Environm & Rural Sci, Aberystwyth, Dyfed, Wales.",krh@aber.ac.uk,,"Fernandez-Fuentes, Narcis/0000-0002-6421-1080; Pierrot, Christine/0000-0002-6835-6789; Dunne, David/0000-0002-8940-9886; Khalife, Jamal/0000-0002-4359-8976",European Union [242107]; Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council [BBS/E/W/10962A01D],"This research was funded by the European Union's Seventh Framework Programme (FP7/2007-2013; http://ec.europa.eu/research/fp7/index_en.cfm) under grant agreement number 242107.

Understanding the epidemiology of human cysticercosis (HCC) in endemic regions will help to expose critical information about the transmission of the disease, which could be used to design efficient control programs. This review gathered serological data on apparent prevalence of T. solium circulating antigens and/or seroprevalence of T. solium antibodies, apparent prevalence of human taeniasis and risk factors for HCC from endemic communities in order to understand the differences in exposure to the parasite and active infections with T. solium metacestodes in endemic areas around the world. Methods Three databases were used to search sero-epidemiological data from community-based studies conducted between 1989 and 2014 in cysticercosis endemic communities worldwide. The search focused on data obtained from T. solium circulating antigen detection by monoclonal antibody-based sandwich ELISA and/or T. solium antibody seroprevalence determined by Enzyme-linked Immunoelectrotransfer Blot (EITB). A meta-analysis was performed per continent. Principal Findings A total of 39,271 participants from 19 countries, described in 37 articles were studied. The estimates for the prevalence of circulating T. solium antigens for Africa, Latin America and Asia were: 7.30%(95% CI [4.23-12.31]), 4.08% (95% CI [2.77-5.95]) and 3.98% (95% CI [2.81-5.61]), respectively. Seroprevalence estimates of T. solium antibodies were 17.37% (95% CI [3.33-56.20]), 13.03% (95% CI [9.95-16.88]) and 15.68% (95% CI [10.25-23.24]) respectively. Taeniasis reported prevalences ranged from 0 (95% CI [0.00-1.62]) to 17.25% (95% CI [14.55-20.23]). Significance A significant variation in the sero-epidemiological data was observed within each continent, with African countries reporting the highest apparent prevalences of active infections. Intrinsic factors in the human host such as age and immunity were main determinants for the occurrence of infections, while exposure was mostly related to environmental factors which varied from community to community.","[Coral-Almeida, Marco; Gabriel, Sarah; Abatih, Emmanuel Nji; Praet, Nicolas; Dorny, Pierre] Inst Trop Med, Dept Biomed Sci, B-2000 Antwerp, Belgium; [Coral-Almeida, Marco; Dorny, Pierre] Univ Ghent, Fac Vet Med, Merelbeke, Belgium; [Coral-Almeida, Marco; Benitez, Washington] Univ Cent Ecuador, Ctr Int Zoonosis, Quito, Ecuador; [Coral-Almeida, Marco] Amer Univ, Escuela Med Vet & Zootecnia, Quito, Ecuador; [Benitez, Washington] Univ Cent Ecuador, Fac Med Vet & Zootecnia, Quito, Ecuador","Coral-Almeida, M (reprint author), Inst Trop Med, Dept Biomed Sci, B-2000 Antwerp, Belgium.",marco.coralalmeida@ugent.be,"Dorny, Pierre/B-8590-2008","Coral, Marco/0000-0003-0211-2906","Institute of Tropical Medicine in Antwerp, Belgium; Centro Internacional de Zoonosis, Quito-Ecuador","This work was financially supported by the Belgian Cooperation in the framework of the Institutional Collaboration between the Institute of Tropical Medicine in Antwerp, Belgium and the Centro Internacional de Zoonosis, Quito-Ecuador.

The habitat of the tsetse fly vector is increasingly fragmented owing to demographic pressure and shifts in climate, which leads to heterogeneous risk of cyclical transmission both in space and time. In Burkina Faso and Ghana, the most important vectors are riverine species, namely Glossina palpalis gambiensis and G. tachinoides, which are more resilient to human-induced changes than the savannah and forest species. Although many authors studied the distribution of AAT risk both in space and time, spatio-temporal models allowing predictions of it are lacking. Methodology/Principal Findings We used datasets generated by various projects, including two baseline surveys conducted in Burkina Faso and Ghana within PATTEC (Pan African Tsetse and Trypanosomosis Eradication Campaign) national initiatives. We computed the entomological inoculation rate (EIR) or tsetse challenge using a range of environmental data. The tsetse apparent density and their infection rate were separately estimated and subsequently combined to derive the EIR using a ""one layer-one model"" approach. The estimated EIR was then projected into suitable habitat. This risk index was finally validated against data on bovine trypanosomosis. It allowed a good prediction of the parasitological status (r(2) = 67%), showed a positive correlation but less predictive power with serological status (r(2) = 22%) aggregated at the village level but was not related to the illness status (r(2) = 2%). Conclusions/Significance The presented spatio-temporal model provides a fine-scale picture of the dynamics of AAT risk in sub-humid areas of West Africa. The estimated EIR was high in the proximity of rivers during the dry season and more widespread during the rainy season. The present analysis is a first step in a broader framework for an efficient risk management of climate-sensitive vector-borne diseases.","[Dicko, Ahmadou H.] Cheikh Anta Diop Univ, West African Sci Serv Climate Change & Adapted La, Climate Change Econ Res Program, Dakar, Senegal; [Percoma, Lassane; Sidibe, Issa; Dayo, Guiguigbaza-Kossigan] Pan African Tsetse & Trypanosomiasis Eradicat Cam, Bobo Dioulasso, Burkina Faso; [Sow, Adama] Ecole Inter Etats Sci & Med Vet Dakar EISMV, Dakar, Senegal; [Adam, Yahaya; Mahama, Charles] Minist Food & Agr, Vet Serv Dept, Pong Tamale, Ghana; [Sidibe, Issa; Dayo, Guiguigbaza-Kossigan; Salou, Ernest] Ctr Int Rech Dev Elevage Zone Subhumide CIRDES, Bobo Dioulasso, Burkina Faso; [Thevenon, Sophie] CIRAD, UMR INTERTRYP, Montpellier, France; [Fonta, William; Sanfo, Safietou] Wes African Sci Ctr Climate Change & Adapted Land, Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso; [Djiteye, Aligui] Pan African Tsetse & Trypanosomosis Eradicat Camp, Direct Natl Serv Vet, Bamako, Mali; [Salou, Ernest] Univ Polytech Bobo Dioulasso UPB, Bobo Dioulasso, Burkina Faso; [Djohan, Vincent] Felix Houphouet Boigny Univ, Natl Inst Publ Hlth, Abidjan, Cote Ivoire; [Cecchi, Giuliano] Food & Agr Org United Nations FAO, Sub Reg Off Eastern Africa, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia; [Bouyer, Jeremy] CIRAD, UMR CMAEE, Dakar, Senegal; [Bouyer, Jeremy] CIRAD, UMR CMAEE, Montpellier, France; [Bouyer, Jeremy] CMAEE, INRA, UMR1309, Montpellier, France; [Bouyer, Jeremy] LNERV, Inst Senegalais Rech Agr, Dakar, Senegal","Dicko, AH (reprint author), Cheikh Anta Diop Univ, West African Sci Serv Climate Change & Adapted La, Climate Change Econ Res Program, Dakar, Senegal.",ahmadou.dicko@ucad.edu.sn,,"Fonta, William/0000-0002-1398-3355; Thevenon, Sophie/0000-0001-6059-5884; Dicko, Ahmadou Hamady/0000-0002-9654-7582",West African Science Service Center on Climate Change and Adapted Land Use (WASCAL); Institut Carnot Sante Animale (ICSA) excellence network; Government of Italy through the FAO project "Improving food security in sub-Saharan Africa by supporting the progressive reduction of tsetse-transmitted trypanosomosis in the framework of NEPAD" [GTFS/RAF/474/ITA],"This work has been funded by West African Science Service Center on Climate Change and Adapted Land Use (WASCAL), and the project 'Integrated Vector Management: innovating to improve control and reduce environmental impacts' of Institut Carnot Sante Animale (ICSA) excellence network (http://www6.jouy.inra.fr/gabi/Le-Partenariat/L-Institut-Carnot-Sante-Animale-ICSA).

Recent reports of a decline in invasive NTS (iNTS) disease from Kenya and The Gambia have emphasised an association with malaria control. Following a similar decline in iNTS disease in Malawi, we have used 9 years of continuous longitudinal data to model the interrelationships between iNTS disease, malaria, HIV and malnutrition. Methods Trends in monthly numbers of childhood iNTS disease presenting at Queen's Hospital, Blantyre, Malawi from 2002 to 2010 were reviewed in the context of longitudinal monthly data describing malaria slide-positivity among paediatric febrile admissions, paediatric HIV prevalence, nutritional rehabilitation unit admissions and monthly rainfall over the same 9 years, using structural equation models (SEM). Results Analysis of 3,105 iNTS episodes identified from 49,093 blood cultures, showed an 11.8% annual decline in iNTS (p < 0.001). SEM analysis produced a stable model with good fit, revealing direct and statistically significant seasonal effects of malaria and malnutrition on the prevalence of iNTS disease. When these data were smoothed to eliminate seasonal cyclic changes, these associations remained strong and there were additional significant effects of HIV prevalence. Conclusions These data suggest that the overall decline in iNTS disease observed in Malawi is attributable to multiple public health interventions leading to reductions in malaria, HIV and acute malnutrition.

The goal of this study was to characterize the role of histamine during Litomosoides sigmodontis infection of BALB/c mice, a murine model of filariasis. Time course studies demonstrated that while expression of histidine decarboxylase mRNA increases throughout 12 weeks of infection, serum levels of histamine exhibit two peaks-one 30 minutes after primary infection and one 8 weeks later. Interestingly, mice treated with fexofenadine, a histamine receptor 1 inhibitor, demonstrated significantly reduced worm burden in infected mice compared to untreated infected controls. Although fexofenadine-treated mice had decreased antigen-specific IgE levels as well as lower splenocyte IL-5 and IFN gamma production, they exhibited a greater than fourfold rise in eosinophil numbers at the tissue site where adult L. sigmodontis worms reside. Fexofenadine-mediated clearance of L. sigmodontis worms was dependent on host eosinophils, as fexofenadine did not decrease worm burdens in eosinophil-deficient dblGATA mice. These findings suggest that histamine release induced by tissue invasive helminths may aid parasite survival by diminishing eosinophilic responses. Further, these results raise the possibility that combining H1 receptor inhibitors with current anthelmintics may improve treatment efficacy for filariae and other tissue-invasive helminths.","[Fox, Ellen Mueller; Morris, Christopher P.; Huebner, Marc P.; Mitre, Edward] Uniformed Serv Univ Hlth Sci, Dept Microbiol & Immunol, Bethesda, MD 20814 USA; [Fox, Ellen Mueller] Univ Hosp Bonn, Inst Med Microbiol Immunol & Parasitol, Bonn, Germany","Mitre, E (reprint author), Uniformed Serv Univ Hlth Sci, Dept Microbiol & Immunol, Bethesda, MD 20814 USA.",edward.mitre@usuhs.edu,"Hubner, Marc/W-9529-2018; Hubner, Marc P/O-1684-2019","Hubner, Marc/0000-0001-8885-418X; Hubner, Marc P/0000-0001-8885-418X",NIAID/NIH [R01AI076522],"This work was supported by grant R01AI076522 from NIAID/NIH.

In North America (NA), lineage 1 WNV caused the largest outbreak of neuroinvasive disease to date, while a novel pathogenic lineage 2 strain circulates in southern Europe. To estimate WNV lineage 2 epidemic potential it is paramount to know if mosquitoes from currently WNV-free areas can support further spread of this epidemic. Methodology/Principal Findings We assessed WNV vector competence of Culex pipiens mosquitoes originating from north-western Europe (NWE) in direct comparison with those from NA. We exposed mosquitoes to infectious blood meals of lineage 1 or 2 WNV and determined the infection and transmission rates. We explored reasons for vector competence differences by comparing intrathoracic injection versus blood meal infection, and we investigated the influence of temperature. We found that NWE mosquitoes are highly competent for both WNV lineages, with transmission rates up to 25%. Compared to NA mosquitoes, transmission rates for lineage 2 WNV were significantly elevated in NWE mosquitoes due to better virus dissemination from the midgut and a shorter extrinsic incubation time. WNV infection rates further increased with temperature increase. Conclusions/Significance Our study provides experimental evidence to indicate markedly different risk levels between both continents for lineage 2 WNV transmission and suggests a degree of genotype-genotype specificity in the interaction between virus and vector. Our experiments with varying temperatures explain the current localized WNV activity in southern Europe, yet imply further epidemic spread throughout NWE during periods with favourable climatic conditions. This emphasizes the need for intensified surveillance of virus activity in current WNV disease-free regions and warrants increased awareness in clinics throughout Europe.","[Fros, Jelke J.; Geertsema, Corinne; Vlak, Just M.; Pijlman, Gorben P.] Wageningen Univ, Virol Lab, NL-6700 AP Wageningen, Netherlands; [Vogels, Chantal B.; Koenraadt, Constantianus J.; Takken, Willem] Wageningen Univ, Entomol Lab, NL-6700 AP Wageningen, Netherlands; [Roosjen, Peter P.] Wageningen Univ, Lab Geoinformat Sci & Remote Sensing, NL-6700 AP Wageningen, Netherlands; [Failloux, Anna-Bella] Inst Pasteur, Dept Virol Arboviruses & Insect Vectors, Paris, France","Fros, JJ (reprint author), Wageningen Univ, Virol Lab, NL-6700 AP Wageningen, Netherlands.",gorben.pijlman@wur.nl,"Roosjen, Peter/F-5487-2016; Vogels, Chantal/N-1749-2015","Roosjen, Peter/0000-0001-6029-1047; Fros, Jelke/0000-0002-3291-8401; Vogels, Chantal/0000-0003-0027-6480; Koenraadt, Constantianus/0000-0001-7861-8781",European 195 Community's Seventh Framework Programme (FP7 VECTORIE project) [261466],"This work is supported by the European 195 Community's Seventh Framework Programme (FP7 VECTORIE project number 261466).

H. ducreyi is generally susceptible to macrolides, but CU strains persist after mass drug administration of azithromycin for yaws or trachoma. H. ducreyi also causes genital ulcers (GU) and was thought to be exclusively transmitted by microabrasions that occur during sex. In human volunteers, the GU strain 35000HP does not infect intact skin; wounds are required to initiate infection. These data led to several questions: Are CU strains a new variant of H. ducreyi or did they evolve from GU strains? Do CU strains contain additional genes that could allow them to infect intact skin? Are CU strains susceptible to azithromycin? Methodology/Principal Findings To address these questions, we performed whole-genome sequencing and antibiotic susceptibility testing of 5 CU strains obtained from Samoa and Vanuatu and 9 archived class I and class II GU strains. Except for single nucleotide polymorphisms, the CU strains were genetically almost identical to the class I strain 35000HP and had no additional genetic content. Phylogenetic analysis showed that class I and class II strains formed two separate clusters and CU strains evolved from class I strains. Class I strains diverged from class II strains similar to 1.95 million years ago (mya) and CU strains diverged from the class I strain 35000HP similar to 0.18 mya. CU and GU strains evolved under similar selection pressures. Like 35000HP, the CU strains were highly susceptible to antibiotics, including azithromycin. Conclusions/Significance These data suggest that CU strains are derivatives of class I strains that were not recognized until recently. These findings require confirmation by analysis of CU strains from other regions.","[Gangaiah, Dharanesh; Fortney, Kate R.; Toh, Evelyn; Spinola, Stanley M.] Indiana Univ Sch Med, Dept Microbiol & Immunol, Indianapolis, IN 46202 USA; [Webb, Kristen M.; Humphreys, Tricia L.] Allegheny Coll, Dept Biol, Meadville, PA 16335 USA; [Tai, Albert] Tufts Univ, Sch Med, Genom Core, Boston, MA 02111 USA; [Katz, Samantha S.; Pillay, Allan; Chen, Cheng-Yen] Ctr Dis Control & Prevent, Lab Reference & Res Branch, Div STD Prevent, Natl Ctr HIV AIDS Viral Hepatitis STD & TB Preven, Atlanta, GA USA; [Roberts, Sally A.] Auckland Dist Hlth Board, Dept Microbiol, Auckland, New Zealand; [Munson, Robert S., Jr.] Ohio State Univ, Coll Med, Res Inst, Ctr Microbial Pathogenesis,Nationwide Childrens H, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [Munson, Robert S., Jr.] Ohio State Univ, Coll Med, Dept Pediat, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [Spinola, Stanley M.] Indiana Univ Sch Med, Dept Med, Indianapolis, IN 46202 USA; [Spinola, Stanley M.] Indiana Univ Sch Med, Dept Pathol & Lab Med, Indianapolis, IN 46202 USA; [Spinola, Stanley M.] Indiana Univ Sch Med, Ctr Immunobiol, Indianapolis, IN 46202 USA","Gangaiah, D (reprint author), Indiana Univ Sch Med, Dept Microbiol & Immunol, Indianapolis, IN 46202 USA.",sspinola@iupui.edu,,"Toh, Evelyn/0000-0003-2932-4060",National Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) [AI27863]; Indiana University School of Medicine,"This work was supported by grant AI27863 to SMS from the National Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) and by funds provided by the Indiana University School of Medicine.

Sand fly larval stages acquire microorganisms from the soil, and the abundance and distribution of these microorganisms may vary depending on the sand fly species or the breeding site. Here, we assess the distribution of two bacteria commonly found within the gut of sand flies, Pantoea agglomerans and Bacillus subtilis. We demonstrate that these bacteria are able to differentially infect the larval digestive tract, and regulate the immune response in sand fly larvae.

In late October 2011, a local health official from Dohar Sub-district, Dhaka District, reported an outbreak of undiagnosed fever and joint pain. We investigated the outbreak to confirm the etiology, describe the clinical presentation, and identify associated vectors. Methodology During November 2-21, 2011, we conducted house-to-house surveys to identify suspected cases, defined as any inhabitant of Char Kushai village with fever followed by joint pain in the extremities with onset since August 15, 2011. We collected blood specimens and clinical histories from self-selected suspected cases using a structured questionnaire. Blood samples were tested for IgM antibodies against Chikungunya virus. The village was divided into nine segments and we collected mosquito larvae from water containers in seven randomly selected houses in each segment. We calculated the Breteau index for the village and identified the mosquito species. Results The attack rate was 29% (1105/3840) and 29% of households surveyed had at least one suspected case: 15% had >= 3. The attack rate was 38% (606/1589) in adult women and 25% in adult men (320/1287). Among the 1105 suspected case-patients, 245 self-selected for testing and 80% of those (196/245) had IgM antibodies. In addition to fever and joint pain, 76% (148/196) of confirmed cases had rash and 38%(75/196) had long-lasting joint pain. The village Breteau index was 35 per 100 and 89%(449/504) of hatched mosquitoes were Aedes albopictus. Conclusion The evidence suggests that this outbreak was due to Chikungunya. The high attack rate suggests that the infection was new to this area, and the increased risk among adult women suggests that risk of transmission may have been higher around households. Chikungunya is an emerging infection in Bangladesh and current surveillance and prevention strategies are insufficient to mount an effective public health response.","[Khatun, Selina; Chakraborty, Apurba; Banu, Nuzhat Nasreen; Rahman, Mohammad Mostafizur] Inst Epidemiol Dis Control & Res, Dept Epidemiol, Dhaka, Bangladesh; [Rahman, Mahmudur] Inst Epidemiol Dis Control & Res, Dhaka, Bangladesh; [Hasan, S.

Although cardiac involvement has been reported in dengue, the incidence and the extent of cardiac involvement are not well defined. Methods and Principal findings We characterized the incidence and changes in cardiac function in a prospective in-patient cohort of suspected dengue cases by serial echocardiography. Plasma leakage was detected by serial chest and abdominal ultrasonography. Daily cardiac troponin-T levels were measured. One hundred and eighty one dengue cases were enrolled. On the day of enrollment, dengue cases that already developed plasma leakage had lower cardiac index (2695 (127) vs 3188 (75) (L/min/m(2)), p = .003) and higher left ventricular myocardial performance index (.413 (.021) vs.328 (.026), p = .021) and systemic vascular resistance (2478 (184) vs 1820 (133) (dynes.s/cm(5)), p = .005) compared to those without plasma leakage. Early diastolic wall motion of the left ventricle was decreased in dengue cases with plasma leakage compared to those without. Decreased left ventricular wall motility was more common in dengue patients compared to non-dengue cases particularly in cases with plasma leakage. Differences in cardiac function between DF and DHF were most pronounced around the time of plasma leakage. Cardiac dysfunction was transient and did not require treatment. Transient elevated troponin-T levels were more common in DHF cases compared to DF (14.5% vs 5%, p = 0.028). Conclusions Transient left ventricular systolic and diastolic dysfunction was common in children hospitalized with dengue and related to severity of plasma leakage. The functional abnormality spontaneously resolved without specific treatment. Cardiac structural changes including myocarditis were uncommon.","[Kirawittaya, Tawatchai; Kalayanarooj, Siripen] Queen Sirikit Natl Inst Child Hlth, Bangkok, Thailand; [Yoon, In-Kyu; Wichit, Sineewanlaya] Armed Forces Res Inst Med Sci, Dept Virol, Bangkok 10400, Thailand; [Green, Sharone; Ennis, Francis A.; Srikiatkhachorn, Anon] Univ Massachusetts, Sch Med, Dept Med, Div Infect Dis & Immunol, Worcester, MA USA; [Gibbons, Robert V.] US Army Inst Surg Res, Inst Surg Res, Houston, TX USA; [Thomas, Stephen J.] Walter Reed Army Inst Res, Viral Dis Branch, Silver Spring, MD USA; [Rothman, Alan L.] Univ Rhode Isl, Inst Immunol & Informat, Providence, RI 02908 USA","Kirawittaya, T (reprint author), Queen Sirikit Natl Inst Child Hlth, Bangkok, Thailand.",anon.srikiatkhachorn@umassmed.edu,,"Rothman, Alan/0000-0002-4064-6848",National Institutes of Health [NIH-P01AI34533]; Military Infectious Disease Research Program [S0328_11_AF_PP],"This research was supported by the National Institutes of Health (NIH-P01AI34533 to SG, FAE, ALR, SK, AS) and Military Infectious Disease Research Program (S0328_11_AF_PP to SJT, RVG, IKY).

Interestingly, although grain formation is key in mycetoma, its formation process and its susceptibility towards antifungal agents are not well understood. This is because grain formation cannot be induced in vitro; a mammalian host is necessary to induce its formation. Until now, invertebrate hosts were never used to study grain formation in M. mycetomatis. In this study we determined if larvae of the greater wax moth Galleria mellonella could be used to induce grain formation when infected with M. mycetomatis. Three different M. mycetomatis strains were selected and three different inocula for each strain were used to infect G. mellonella larvae, ranging from 0.04 mg/larvae to 4 mg/larvae. Larvae were monitored for 10 days. It appeared that most larvae survived the lowest inoculum, but at the highest inoculum all larvae died within the 10 day observation period. At all inocula tested, grains were formed within 4 hours after infection. The grains produced in the larvae resembled those formed in human and in mammalian hosts. In conclusion, the M. mycetomatis grain model in G. mellonella larvae described here could serve as a useful model to study the grain formation and therapeutic responses towards antifungal agents in the future.","[Kloezen, Wendy; van de Sande, Wendy W.

Previously, the immunological basis of self-cure was confirmed; surviving worms had ceased feeding but how immunological pressure achieved this was unclear. The schistosome esophagus is not simply a conduit for blood but plays a central role in its processing. Secretions from the anterior and posterior esophageal glands mix with incoming blood causing erythrocyte lysis and tethering and killing of leucocytes. Methodology/Principal Findings We have analysed the self-cure process in rhesus macaques infected with Schistosoma japonicum. Faecal egg output and circulating antigen levels were used to chart the establishment of a mature worm population and its subsequent demise. The physiological stress of surviving females at perfusion was especially evident from their pale, shrunken appearance, while changes in the structure and function of the esophagus were observed in both sexes. In the anterior region electron microscopy revealed that the vesicle secretory process was disrupted, the tips of lining corrugations being swollen by greatly enlarged vesicles and the putative sites of vesicle release obscured by intense deposits of IgG. The lumen of the posterior esophagus in starving worms was occluded by cellular debris and the lining cytoplasmic plates were closely adherent, also potentially preventing secretion. Seven proteins secreted by the posterior gland were identified and IgG responses were detected to some or all of them. Intrinsic rhesus IgG colocalized with secreted SjMEGs 4.1, 8.2, 9, 11 and VAL-7 on cryosections, suggesting they are potential targets for disruption of function. Conclusions/Significance Our data suggest that rhesus macaques self-cure by blocking esophagus function with antibody; the protein products of the glands provide a new class of potential vaccine targets.","[Li, Xiao-Hong; Xu, Yu-Xin; Cao, Jian-Ping] Chinese Ctr Dis Control & Prevent, Natl Inst Parasit Dis, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Li, Xiao-Hong; Xu, Yu-Xin; Cao, Jian-Ping] Minist Hlth, Key Lab Parasitol & Vector Biol, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Vance, Gill; Wilson, R.

It is known that these DTUs have different geographical distribution, as well as biological features. TcI and TcII are major DTUs found in patients from northern and southern Latin America, respectively. Our hypothesis is that upon infection of human peripheral blood cells, Y strain (Tc II) and Col cl1.7 (Tc I), cause distinct immunological changes, which might influence the clinical course of Chagas disease. Methodology/Principal Findings We evaluated the infectivity of CFSE-stained trypomastigotes of Col cl1.7 and Y strain in human monocytes for 15 and 72 hours, and determined the immunological profile of lymphocytes and monocytes exposed to the different isolates using multiparameter flow cytometry. Our results showed a similar percentage and intensity of monocyte infection by Y and Col cl1.7. We also observed an increased expression of CD80 and CD86 by monocytes infected with Col cl1.7, but not Y strain. IL-10 was significantly higher in monocytes infected with Col cl1.7, as compared to Y strain. Moreover, infection with Col cl1.7, but not Y strain, led to an increased expression of IL-17 by CD8+ T cells. On the other hand, we observed a positive correlation between the expression of TNF-alpha and granzyme A only after infection with Y strain. Conclusion/Significance Our study shows that while Col cl1.7 induces higher monocyte activation and, at the same time, production of IL-10, infection with Y strain leads to a lower monocyte activation but higher inflammatory profile. These results show that TcI and TcII have a distinct immunological impact on human cells during early infection, which might influence disease progression.","[Magalhaes, Luisa M.

However, stool microscopy has several shortcomings that greatly affect the efficacy of current schistosomiasis control programs. A highly specific multiplex real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) targeting the Schistosoma internal transcriber-spacer-2 sequence (ITS2) was developed by our group a few years ago, but so far this PCR has been applied mostly on urine samples. Here, we performed more in-depth evaluation of the ITS2 PCR as an alternative method to standard microscopy for the detection and quantification of Schistosoma spp. in stool samples. Methodology/Principal findings Microscopy and PCR were performed in a Senegalese community (n = 197) in an area with high S. mansoni transmission and co-occurrence of S. haematobium, and in Kenyan schoolchildren (n = 760) from an area with comparatively low S. mansoni transmission. Despite the differences in Schistosoma endemicity the PCR performed very similarly in both areas; 13-15% more infections were detected by PCR when comparing to microscopy of a single stool sample. Even when 2-3 stool samples were used for microscopy, PCR on one stool sample detected more infections, especially in people with light-intensity infections and in children from low-risk schools. The low prevalence of soil-transmitted helminthiasis in both populations was confirmed by an additional multiplex PCR. Conclusions/Significance The ITS2-based PCR was more sensitive than standard microscopy in detecting Schistosoma spp. This would be particularly useful for S. mansoni detection in low transmission areas, and post-control settings, and as such improve schistosomiasis control programs, epidemiological research, and quality control of microscopy. Moreover, it can be complemented with other (multiplex real-time) PCRs to detect a wider range of helminths and thus enhance effectiveness of current integrated control and elimination strategies for neglected tropical diseases.","[Meurs, Lynn; Brienen, Eric; van Lieshout, Lisette] Leiden Univ, Dept Parasitol, Med Ctr, Leiden, Netherlands; [Meurs, Lynn; Polman, Katja] Inst Trop Med, Dept Biomed Sci, B-2000 Antwerp, Belgium; [Mbow, Moustapha; Mboup, Souleymane] Aristide Le Dantec Teaching Hosp, Lab Bacteriol & Virol, Dakar, Senegal; [Ochola, Elizabeth A.; Karanja, Diana M.

To investigate the utility of CDV as a polyvalent vaccine vector for Leishmania, we generated recombinant CDVs, based on an avirulent Yanaka strain, that expressed Leishmania antigens: LACK, TSA, or LmSTI1 (rCDV-LACK, rCDV-TSA, and rCDV-LmSTI1, respectively). Dogs immunized with rCDV-LACK were protected against challenge with lethal doses of virulent CDV, in the same way as the parental Yanaka strain. To evaluate the protective effects of the recombinant CDVs against cutaneous leishmaniasis in dogs, dogs were immunized with one recombinant CDV or a cocktail of three recombinant CDVs, before intradermal challenge (in the ears) with infective-stage promastigotes of Leishmania major. Unvaccinated dogs showed increased nodules with ulcer formation after 3 weeks, whereas dogs immunized with rCDV-LACK showed markedly smaller nodules without ulceration. Although the rCDV-TSA-and rCDV-LmSTI1-immunized dogs showed little protection against L. major, the cocktail of three recombinant CDVs more effectively suppressed the progression of nodule formation than immunization with rCDV-LACK alone. These results indicate that recombinant CDV is suitable for use as a polyvalent live attenuated vaccine for protection against both CDV and L. major infections in dogs.","[Miura, Ryuichi; Kooriyama, Takanori; Yoneda, Misako; Takenaka, Akiko; Doki, Miho; Endo, Yasuyuki; Fujiyuki, Tomoko; Sugai, Akihiro; Sato, Hiroki; Kai, Chieko] Univ Tokyo, Inst Med Sci, Lab Anim Res Ctr, Tokyo 108, Japan; [Goto, Yasuyuki; Sanjoba, Chizu; Matsumoto, Yoshitsugu] Univ Tokyo, Dept Mol Immunol, Sch Agr & Life Sci, Tokyo, Japan; [Tsukiyama-Kohara, Kyoko] Kagoshima Univ, Joint Fac Vet Med, Kagoshima 890, Japan","Miura, R (reprint author), Univ Tokyo, Inst Med Sci, Lab Anim Res Ctr, Tokyo 108, Japan.",ckai@ims.u-tokyo.ac.jp,"Goto, Yasuyuki/E-9028-2011","Goto, Yasuyuki/0000-0002-8654-7888","Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS), Japan","This work was supported by Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI Kiban-A) from Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS), Japan (CK).

Due to its inherent resistance to the major antibiotic classes and its facultative intracellular pathogenicity, an effective vaccine would be extremely desirable, along with appropriate prevention and therapeutic management. One of the main subunit vaccine candidates is flagellin of Burkholderia pseudomallei (FliC(Bp)). Here, we present the high resolution crystal structure of FliC(Bp) and report the synthesis and characterization of three peptides predicted to be both B and T cell FliC(Bp) epitopes, by both structure-based in silico methods, and sequence-based epitope prediction tools. All three epitopes were shown to be immunoreactive against human IgG antibodies and to elicit cytokine production from human peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Furthermore, two of the peptides (F51-69 and F270-288) were found to be dominant immunoreactive epitopes, and their antibodies enhanced the bactericidal activities of purified human neutrophils. The epitopes derived from this study may represent potential melioidosis vaccine components.","[Nithichanon, Arnone; Rinchai, Darawan; Lertmemonkolchai, Ganjana] Khon Kaen Univ, Fac Associated Med Sci, Ctr Res & Dev Med Diagnost Labs, Khon Kaen, Thailand; [Gori, Alessandro; Peri, Claudio; Colombo, Giorgio] CNR, Ist Chim Riconoscimento Mol, I-20133 Milan, Italy; [Lassaux, Patricia; Gourlay, Louise J.; Nardini, Marco; Bolognesi, Martino] Univ Milan, Dept Biosci, CIMAINA, Milan, Italy; [Lassaux, Patricia; Gourlay, Louise J.; Nardini, Marco; Bolognesi, Martino] Univ Milan, Inst Biophys, CNR, Milan, Italy; [Conchillio-Sole, Oscar; Daura, Xavier] Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Inst Biotechnol & Biomed, Bellaterra, Spain; [Ferrer-Navarro, Mario; Vila, Jordi] Univ Barcelona, Sch Med, Dept Clin Microbiol, Hosp Clin, Barcelona, Spain; [Daura, Xavier] Catalan Inst Res & Adv Studies, Barcelona, Spain","Nithichanon, A (reprint author), Khon Kaen Univ, Fac Associated Med Sci, Ctr Res & Dev Med Diagnost Labs, Khon Kaen, Thailand.",ganja_le@kku.ac.th,"Daura, Xavier/C-9275-2009; Colombo, Giorgio/A-2730-2012; Nardini, Marco/B-7842-2017; Vila, Jordi/P-3613-2016; Bolognesi, Martino/B-7924-2017; Gori, Alessandro/A-1357-2019; Peri, Claudio/P-9590-2018","Daura, Xavier/0000-0001-9235-6730; Colombo, Giorgio/0000-0002-1318-668X; Nardini, Marco/0000-0002-3718-2165; Vila, Jordi/0000-0002-8025-3926; Bolognesi, Martino/0000-0002-9253-5170; Gori, Alessandro/0000-0003-1640-7238; GOURLAY, LOUISE JANE/0000-0002-6369-2230; Ferrer-Navarro, Mario/0000-0001-9990-914X; Rinchai, Darawan/0000-0001-8851-7730","Thailand Research Fund through the Royal Golden Jubilee Ph.D. Program [PHD/0167/2553]; Fondazione CARIPLO [2009-3577, 42666248]; Regione Lombardia [42666248]; University of Milan; ICREA","Financial support from the Thailand Research Fund through the Royal Golden Jubilee Ph.D. Program (Grant No. PHD/0167/2553 to AN and GL) is acknowledged.

Despite constants efforts, no specific treatment or effective vaccine is yet available. Here we show a novel design of a DNA immunisation strategy that resulted in the induction of strong antibody responses with high neutralisation titres in mice against all four viral serotypes. The immunogenic molecule is an engineered version of the domain III (DIII) of the virus E protein fused to the dimerising CH3 domain of the IgG immunoglobulin H chain. The DIII sequences were also codon-optimised for expression in mammalian cells. While DIII alone is very poorly secreted, the codon-optimised fusion protein is rightly expressed, folded and secreted at high levels, thus inducing strong antibody responses. Mice were immunised using gene-gun technology, an efficient way of intradermal delivery of the plasmid DNA, and the vaccine was able to induce neutralising titres against all serotypes. Additionally, all sera showed reactivity to a recombinant DIII version and the recombinant E protein produced and secreted from mammalian cells in a mono-biotinylated form when tested in a conformational ELISA. Sera were also highly reactive to infective viral particles in a virus-capture ELISA and specific for each serotype as revealed by the low cross-reactive and cross-neutralising activities. The serotype specific sera did not induce antibody dependent enhancement of infection (ADE) in non-homologous virus serotypes. A tetravalent immunisation protocol in mice showed induction of neutralising antibodies against all four dengue serotypes as well.","[Poggianella, Monica; Campos, Jose L.

The virulent Wolbachia strain wMelPop is known to cause several pathological impacts (increased egg mortality, life shortening, etc.) reducing overall fitness in the mosquito Ae. aegypti. Increased egg mortality could substantially reduce egg banks in areas with a lengthy monsoonal dry season, and be employed to eliminate local populations. We tested this application under semi-field cage conditions. First, we determined that wMelPop infection significantly reduced the survival of desiccation-resistant eggs of the dengue vector Ae. aegypti, with shade and temperature having a significant impact; nearly all wMelPop-infected eggs failed to hatch after 6 and 10 weeks in summer and winter conditions, respectively. In laboratory selection experiments we found that egg desiccation resistance can be increased by selection, and that this effect of wMelPop infection is due to the nuclear background of the host rather than Wolbachia. We then conducted an invasion of wMelPop within a semi-field cage using sustained weekly releases of wMelPop infected mosquitoes, with fixation achieved after 9 weeks. The egg populations wMelPop infected and an uninfected control were then subjected to a simulated prolonged monsoonal dry season (2.5 months) before flooding to induce hatching. The wMelPop infected eggs suffered significantly greater mortality than the controls, with only 0.67% and 4.35% of respective infected and uninfected eggs held in 99% shade hatching after 80 days. These studies suggest that wMelPop could be used to locally eliminate populations of Ae. aegypti that are exposed to prolonged dry conditions, particularly if combined with vector control.","[Ritchie, Scott A.; Townsend, Michael; Paton, Chris J.] James Cook Univ, Australian Inst Trop Hlth & Med, Coll Publ Hlth Med & Vet Sci, Cairns, Qld, Australia; [Ritchie, Scott A.; Townsend, Michael; Paton, Chris J.] James Cook Univ, Australian Inst Trop Hlth & Med, Cairns, Qld, Australia; [Callahan, Ashley G.; Hoffmann, Ary A.] Univ Melbourne, Inst Bio21, Dept Genet, Pest & Dis Vector Grp, Melbourne, Vic, Australia","Ritchie, SA (reprint author), James Cook Univ, Australian Inst Trop Hlth & Med, Coll Publ Hlth Med & Vet Sci, Cairns, Qld, Australia.",scott.ritchie@jcu.edu.au,"Hoffmann, Ary/R-2972-2019; Hoffmann, Ary/C-2961-2011","Hoffmann, Ary/0000-0001-9497-7645; ","Australian Research Council [FL100100066]; National Health Medical Research Council [1037003, 1044698]","The work was funded by Australian Research Council Laureate Fellowship - FL100100066 www.arc.gov.au, National Health Medical Research Council - 1037003 and Senior Research Fellowship 1044698 (www.nhmrc.gov.au).

Transmission has been interrupted in the three endemic foci of that country and mass drug distribution has ceased. Three years after mass drug distribution ended, post-treatment surveillance (PTS) surveys were undertaken which employed entomological indicators to check for transmission recrudescence. Methodology/Principal findings In-depth entomologic assessments were performed in 18 communities in the three endemic foci of Mexico. None of the 108,212 Simulium ochraceum s.l. collected from the three foci were found to contain parasite DNA when tested by polymerase chain reaction-enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (PCR-ELISA), resulting in a maximum upper bound of the 95% confidence interval (95%-ULCI) of the infective rate in the vectors of 0.035/2,000 flies examined. This is an order of magnitude below the threshold of a 95%-ULCI of less than one infective fly per 2,000 flies tested, the current entomological criterion for interruption of transmission developed by the international community. The point estimate of seasonal transmission potential (STP) was zero, and the upper bound of the 95% confidence interval for the STP ranged from 1.2 to 1.7 L-3/person/season in the different foci. This value is below all previous estimates for the minimum transmission potential required to maintain the parasite population. Conclusions/Significance The results from the in-depth entomological post treatment surveillance surveys strongly suggest that transmission has not resumed in the three foci of Mexico during the three years since the last distribution of ivermectin occurred; it was concluded that transmission remains undetectable without intervention, and Onchocerca volvulus has been eliminated from Mexico.","[Rodriguez-Perez, Mario A.; Rodriguez-Morales, Kristel B.] Inst Politecn Nacl, Ctr Biotecnol Genom, Reynosa, Tamaulipas, Mexico; [Fernandez-Santos, Nadia A.; Orozco-Algarra, Maria E.; Rodriguez-Atanacio, Jose A.; Gonzalez-Roldan, Jesus F.] Secretaria Salud Mexico, Ctr Nacl Programas Preventivos & Control Enfermed, Direcc Gen Programas Preventivos, Mexico City, DF, Mexico; [Dominguez-Vazquez, Alfredo] Onchocerciasis Eliminat Program Amer, Guatemala City, Guatemala; [Real-Najarro, Olga] Consejeria Educ, Madrid, Spain; [Prado-Velasco, Francisco G.] Secretaria Salud Unidad Adm, Dept Prevenc & Control Enfermedades Transmitidas, Programa Eliminac Oncocercosis Chiapas, Tuxtla Gutierrez, Chiapas, Mexico; [Cupp, Eddie W.] Auburn Univ, Dept Entomol & Plant Pathol, Auburn, AL 36849 USA; [Richards, Frank O., Jr.] Emory Univ, Carter Ctr, River Blindness Program, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA; [Hassan, Hassan K.; Unnasch, Thomas R.] Univ S Florida, Dept Global Hlth, Global Hlth Infect Dis Res Program, Tampa, FL USA; [Kuri-Morales, Pablo A.] Secretaria Salud Mexico, Subsecretaria Prevenc & Promoc Salud, Mexico City, DF, Mexico","Rodriguez-Perez, MA (reprint author), Inst Politecn Nacl, Ctr Biotecnol Genom, Reynosa, Tamaulipas, Mexico.",mrodriguez@ipn.mx,,,Onchocerciasis Elimination Program for the Americas (The Carter Center); Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation; Lions Clubs International Foundation; Ministry of Health Mexico (Centro Nacional de Programas Preventivos y Control de Enfermedades); Health Services of the State of Oaxaca; Health Services of the State of Chiapas; CONACYT-Mexico [246116]; Comision de Operacion y Fomento de Actividades Academicas del IPN,"This study was supported by the Onchocerciasis Elimination Program for the Americas (The Carter Center), the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, and Lions Clubs International Foundation.

Aim To identify the association between FALs and the QoL of patients during and post leprosy treatment. Materials and Methods Cross-sectional survey of 104 patients with leprosy followed in specialist reference centres in Sergipe, Brazil, between June and October 2014. QoL was evaluated using the World Health Organization-QoL-BREF (WHOQoL-BREF) questionnaire. The SALSA scale was used to measure FALs. Results Low SALSA scores were present in 76% of patients. QoL scores were lower for the physical and environmental domains, with median (interquartile range (IQR)) scores of 53.6 (32.1-67.9) and 53.1 (46.9-64.8), respectively. There was a statistical association between increasing SALSA scores and lower QoL as measured by the WHOQoL-BREF. Conclusion Functional limitations are associated with lower QoL in leprosy patients, especially in the physical and environmental WHOQoL-BREF domains.","[Santos, Victor S.; Gois-Santos, Vanessa T.; Ribeiro, Maria do C.

In the present study, we evaluated the ability of Leptospira spp. to induce NETosis using human ex vivo and murine in vivo models. Microscopy and fluorometric studies showed that incubation of human neutrophils with Leptospira interrogans serovar Copenhageni strain Fiocruz L1-130 (LIC) resulted in the release of DNA extracellular traps (NETs). The bacteria number, pathogenicity and viability were relevant factors for induction of NETs, but bacteria motility was not. Entrapment of LIC in the NETs resulted in LIC death; however, pathogenic but not saprophytic Leptospira sp. exerted nuclease activity and degraded DNA. Mice infected with LIC showed circulating NETs after 2 days post-infection (dpi). Depletion of neutrophils with mAb1A8 significantly reduced the amount of intravascular NETs in LIC-infected mice, increasing bacteremia at 3 dpi. Although there was a low bacterial burden, scarce neutrophils and an absence of inflammation in the early stages of infection in the kidney and liver, at the beginning of the leptospiruric phase, the bacterial burden was significantly higher in kidneys of neutrophil-depleted-mice compared to non-depleted and infected mice. Surprisingly, interstitial nephritis was of similar intensity in both groups of infected mice. Taken together, these data suggest that LIC triggers NETs, and that the intravascular formation of these DNA traps appears to be critical not only to prevent early leptospiral dissemination but also to preclude further bacterial burden.","[Scharrig, Emilia; Ferrer, Maria F.; Cedola, Maia; Pretre, Gabriela; Gomez, Ricardo M.] CONICET UNLP, CCT La Plata, Inst Biotechnol & Mol Biol, Lab Anim Viruses, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [Carestia, Agostina; Schattner, Mirta] Consejo Nacl Invest Cient & Tecn, Natl Acad Med, Inst Expt Med, Lab Expt Thrombosis, RA-1033 Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [Drut, Ricardo] Children Hosp Super Sor Maria Ludovica, Div Pathol, La Plata, Buenos Aires, Argentina; [Drut, Ricardo] Univ Nacl La Plata, Catedra Patol A, Fac Med, La Plata, Buenos Aires, Argentina; [Picardeau, Mathieu] Inst Pasteur, Biol Spirochetes Unit, Paris, France","Schattner, M (reprint author), Consejo Nacl Invest Cient & Tecn, Natl Acad Med, Inst Expt Med, Lab Expt Thrombosis, RA-1033 Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina.",mschattner@hematologia.anm.edu.ar; rmg1426@gmail.com,,"PRETRE, GABRIELA/0000-0002-0428-1570; Scharrig, Emilia/0000-0003-2599-5297","ANPCyT [12-0434, 11-733]","This work was supported by PICTs grant 12-0434 (RMG) and 11-733 (MS) from ANPCyT.

The objectives of this study were to identify risk factors associated with infection and to measure the cost-utility of introducing an echinococcosis prevention program in a rural area. We analyzed human case reports submitted to the Canadian Institutes for Health Information between 2002 and 2011. Over this 10 year period, there were 48 cases associated with E. granulosus/E. canadensis, 16 with E. multilocularis, and 251 cases of echinococcosis for which species was not identified (total 315 cases). Nationally, annual incidence of echinococcosis was 0.14 cases per 100 000 people, which is likely an underestimate due to under-diagnosis and under-reporting. Risk factors for echinococcosis included female gender, age (>65 years), and residing in one of the northern territories (Nunavut, Yukon, or Northwest Territories). The average cost of treating a case of cystic echinococcosis in Canada was $8,842 CAD. Cost-utility analysis revealed that dosing dogs with praziquantel (a cestocide) at six week intervals to control cystic echinococcosis is not currently cost-effective at a threshold of $20,000-100,000 per Quality Adjusted Life Year (QALY) gained, even in a health region with the highest incidence rate in Canada ($666,978 -755,051 per QALY gained). However, threshold analysis demonstrated that the program may become cost-saving at an echinococcosis incidence of 13-85 cases per 100,000 people and therefore, even one additional CE case in a community of 9000 people could result in the monetary benefits of the program outweighing costs.","[Schurer, Janna M.; Jenkins, Emily J.] Univ Saskatchewan, Dept Vet Microbiol, Saskatoon, SK S7N 0W0, Canada; [Rafferty, Ellen; Farag, Marwa] Univ Saskatchewan, Sch Publ Hlth, Saskatoon, SK S7N 0W0, Canada; [Zeng, Wu] Brandeis Univ, Heller Sch, Schneider Inst Hlth Policy, Waltham, MA 02254 USA","Schurer, JM (reprint author), Univ Saskatchewan, Dept Vet Microbiol, Saskatoon, SK S7N 0W0, Canada.",jschurer@gmail.com,,"Schurer, Janna/0000-0001-6122-5332; Jenkins, Emily/0000-0002-5820-8918",Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR); Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (NSERC); Canadian Foundation for Innovation; Saskatchewan Health Research Foundation; NSERC; University of Saskatchewan; NSERC CREATE - ITRap,"Graduate student funding for JMS was provided by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR) Strategic Training Program in Public Health and the Agricultural Rural Ecosystem (PHARE), and a Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (NSERC) Collaborative Research and Training Experience (CREATE) grant to the University of Saskatchewan for an Integrated Training Program in Infectious Diseases, Food Safety and Public Policy (ITRap).

Most studies analyzing the relationship between dengue and climate are based on relatively coarse aggregate measures such as mean temperature. Here, we include both mean temperature and daily fluctuations in temperature in modelling dengue transmission in Dhaka, the capital of Bangladesh. We used a negative binomial generalized linear model, adjusted for rainfall, anomalies in sea surface temperature (an index for El Nino-Southern Oscillation), population density, the number of dengue cases in the previous month, and the long term temporal trend in dengue incidence. In addition to the significant associations of mean temperature and temperature fluctuation with dengue incidence, we found interaction of mean and temperature fluctuation significantly influences disease transmission at a lag of one month. High mean temperature with low fluctuation increases dengue incidence one month later. Besides temperature, dengue incidence was also influenced by sea surface temperature anomalies in the current and previous month, presumably as a consequence of concomitant anomalies in the annual rainfall cycle. Population density exerted a significant positive influence on dengue incidence indicating increasing risk of dengue in over-populated Dhaka. Understanding these complex relationships between climate, population, and dengue incidence will help inform outbreak prediction and control.","[Sharmin, Sifat; Glass, Kathryn; Viennet, Elvina; Harley, David] Australian Natl Univ, Natl Ctr Epidemiol & Populat Hlth, Res Sch Populat Hlth, Canberra, ACT, Australia","Harley, D (reprint author), Australian Natl Univ, Natl Ctr Epidemiol & Populat Hlth, Res Sch Populat Hlth, Canberra, ACT, Australia.",david.harley@anu.edu.au,"Viennet, Elvina/M-5818-2019; Harley, David/B-4910-2017; Harley, David O/C-1326-2010; Viennet, Elvina/D-9032-2017","Viennet, Elvina/0000-0002-1418-1426; Harley, David/0000-0001-6691-5420; Viennet, Elvina/0000-0002-1418-1426; Glass, Kathryn/0000-0001-5905-1310",Australian National University,"The first author (SS) was supported by The Australian National University Higher Degree Research Merit Scholarship (http://www.anu.edu.au/students/scholarships-support/anu-university-research-scholarships).

Small guide RNAs encoded mainly by the thousands of catenated minicircles contain the information for this editing. We analyzed by NGS technology the mitochondrial genomes and transcriptomes of two strains, the old lab UC strain and the recently isolated LEM125 strain. PacBio sequencing provided complete minicircle sequences which avoided the assembly problem of short reads caused by the conserved regions. Minicircles were identified by a characteristic size, the presence of three short conserved sequences, a region of inherently bent DNA and the presence of single gRNA genes at a fairly defined location. The LEM125 strain contained over 114 minicircles encoding different gRNAs and the UC strain only similar to 24 minicircles. Some LEM125 minicircles contained no identifiable gRNAs. Approximate copy numbers of the different minicircle classes in the network were determined by the number of PacBio CCS reads that assembled to each class. Mitochondrial RNA libraries from both strains were mapped against the minicircle and maxicircle sequences. Small RNA reads mapped to the putative gRNA genes but also to multiple regions outside the genes on both strands and large RNA reads mapped in many cases over almost the entire minicircle on both strands. These data suggest that minicircle transcription is complete and bidirectional, with 3' processing yielding the mature gRNAs. Steady state RNAs in varying abundances are derived from all maxicircle genes, including portions of the repetitive divergent region. The relative extents of editing in both strains correlated with the presence of a cascade of cognate gRNAs. These data should provide the foundation for a deeper understanding of this dynamic genetic system as well as the evolutionary variation of editing in different strains.","[Simpson, Larry] Univ Calif Los Angeles, David Geffen Sch Med, Dept Microbiol Immunol & Mol Genet, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Douglass, Stephen M.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Bioinformat Interdept Program, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Douglass, Stephen M.; Lake, James A.; Pellegrini, Matteo] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Mol Cellular & Dev Biol, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Li, Feng] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Sch Dent, Dent Res Inst, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA","Simpson, L (reprint author), Univ Calif Los Angeles, David Geffen Sch Med, Dept Microbiol Immunol & Mol Genet, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA.",larrys3255@gmail.com,"Li, Feng/J-1678-2019","Li, Feng/0000-0002-5819-734X; Pellegrini, Matteo/0000-0001-9355-9564","NIH [AI09102, GM095656-01A1]; Institute for Genomics and Proteomics at UCLA; NSF [DEB-0719574]; NASA Astrobiology [DDF R9867-G3]","LS and FL were supported by a research grant from the NIH to LS AI09102.

Relative contributions of individual and cluster-level risk factors to the geographic distribution of disease remain largely unknown. The primary aim of this analysis is to assess the relationship between climatic factors and trachomatous trichiasis (TT) and/or corneal opacity (CO) due to trachoma in Nigeria, while accounting for the effects of individual risk factors and spatial correlation. In addition, we explore the relative importance of variation in the risk of trichiasis and/or corneal opacity (TT/CO) at different levels. Data from the 2007 National Blindness and Visual Impairment Survey were used for this analysis, which included a nationally representative sample of adults aged 40 years and above. Complete data were available from 304 clusters selected using a multi-stage stratified cluster-random sampling strategy. All participants (13,543 individuals) were interviewed and examined by an ophthalmologist for the presence or absence of TT and CO. In addition to field-collected data, remotely sensed climatic data were extracted for each cluster and used to fit Bayesian hierarchical logistic models to disease outcome. The risk of TT/CO was associated with factors at both the individual and cluster levels, with approximately 14% of the total variation attributed to the cluster level. Beyond established individual risk factors (age, gender and occupation), there was strong evidence that environmental/climatic factors at the cluster-level (lower precipitation, higher land surface temperature, higher mean annual temperature and rural classification) were also associated with a greater risk of TT/CO. This study establishes the importance of large-scale risk factors in the geographical distribution of TT/CO in Nigeria, supporting anecdotal evidence that environmental conditions are associated with increased risk in this context and highlighting their potential use in improving estimates of disease burden at large scales.","[Smith, Jennifer L.] London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, Fac Infect & Trop Dis, Dept Dis Control, London WC1, England; [Smith, Jennifer L.] Univ Calif San Francisco, Global Hlth Grp, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; [Sivasubramaniam, Selvaraj] Univ Aberdeen, Med Stat Team, Div Appl Hlth Sci, Aberdeen, Scotland; [Rabiu, Mansur M.] Prevent Blindness Union, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia; [Kyari, Fatima; Solomon, Anthony W.; Gilbert, Clare] London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, Fac Infect & Trop Dis, Dept Clin Res, London WC1, England; [Kyari, Fatima] Univ Abuja, Coll Hlth Sci, Abuja, Nigeria","Smith, JL (reprint author), London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, Fac Infect & Trop Dis, Dept Dis Control, London WC1, England.",jennifer.smith@ucsf.edu,,"Solomon, Anthony/0000-0001-7101-6649",International Trachoma Initiative from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation,"Jennifer L.

Although historical data identifies areas of transmission of these neglected tropical diseases (NTDs), there is a need to update epidemiological data. For this reason, Namibia adopted a new protocol for mapping of schistosomiasis and geohelminths, formally integrating rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) for infections and morbidity. In this article, we explain the protocol in detail, and introduce the concept of 'mapping resolution', as well as present results and treatment recommendations for northern Namibia. Methods/Findings/Interpretation This new protocol allowed a large sample to be surveyed (N = 17 896 children from 299 schools) at relatively low cost (7 USD per person mapped) and very quickly (28 working days). All children were analysed by RDTs, but only a sub-sample was also diagnosed by light microscopy. Overall prevalence of schistosomiasis in the surveyed areas was 9.0%, highly associated with poorer access to potable water (OR = 1.5, P<0.001) and defective (OR = 1.2, P<0.001) or absent sanitation infrastructure (OR = 2.0, P<0.001). Overall prevalence of geohelminths, more particularly hookworm infection, was 12.2%, highly associated with presence of faecal occult blood (OR = 1.9, P<0.001). Prevalence maps were produced and hot spots identified to better guide the national programme in drug administration, as well as targeted improvements in water, sanitation and hygiene. The RDTs employed (circulating cathodic antigen and microhaematuria for Schistosoma mansoni and S. haematobium, respectively) performed well, with sensitivities above 80% and specificities above 95%. Conclusion/Significance This protocol is cost-effective and sensitive to budget limitations and the potential economic and logistical strains placed on the national Ministries of Health. Here we present a high resolution map of disease prevalence levels, and treatment regimens are recommended.","[Sousa-Figueiredo, Jose Carlos] Hosp Prov, Hlth Res Ctr Angola, Ctr Invest Saude Angola, Bengo, Angola; [Sousa-Figueiredo, Jose Carlos] Nat Hist Museum, Wolfson Wellcome Biomed Labs, Dept Life Sci, London SW7 5BD, England; [Stanton, Michelle C.; Stothard, J.

Few studies have assessed the influence of the sample collection site within the ulcer and the sampling method on the sensitivity of parasitological and molecular diagnostic techniques for CL. Sensitivity of the technique can be dependent upon the load and distribution of Leishmania amastigotes in the lesion. Methodology/Principal Findings We applied a quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) assay for Leishmania (Viannia) minicircle kinetoplast DNA (kDNA) detection and parasite load quantification in biopsy and scraping samples obtained from 3 sites within each ulcer (border, base, and center) as well as in cytology brush specimens taken from the ulcer base and center. A total of 248 lesion samples from 31 patients with laboratory confirmed CL of recent onset (<= 3 months) were evaluated. The kDNA-qPCR detected Leishmania DNA in 97.6% (242/248) of the examined samples. Median parasite loads were significantly higher in the ulcer base and center than in the border in biopsies (P<0.0001) and scrapings (P = 0.0002). There was no significant difference in parasite load between the ulcer base and center (P = 0.80, 0.43, and 0.07 for biopsy, scraping, and cytology brush specimens, respectively). The parasite load varied significantly by sampling method: in the ulcer base and center, the descending order for the parasite load levels in samples was: cytology brushes, scrapings, and biopsies (P<0.0001); in the ulcer border, scrapings had higher parasite load than biopsies (P<0.0001). There was no difference in parasite load according to L. braziliensis and L. peruviana infections (P = 0.4). Conclusion/Significance Our results suggest an uneven distribution of Leishmania amastigotes in acute CL ulcers, with higher parasite loads in the ulcer base and center, which has implications for bedside collection of diagnostic specimens. The use of scrapings and cytology brushes is recommended instead of the more invasive biopsy.","[Suarez, Milagros; Valencia, Braulio M.; Jara, Marlene; Alba, Milena; Llanos-Cuentas, Alejandro; Arevalo, Jorge; Adaui, Vanessa] Univ Peruana Cayetano Heredia, Inst Med Trop Alexander von Humboldt, Lima, Peru; [Boggild, Andrea K.] Publ Hlth Ontario, Publ Hlth Ontario Labs, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Boggild, Andrea K.] Univ Toronto, Dept Med, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Boggild, Andrea K.] Toronto Gen Hosp, Univ Hlth Network, Trop Dis Unit, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Dujardin, Jean-Claude] Inst Trop Med, Dept Biomed Sci, B-2000 Antwerp, Belgium; [Dujardin, Jean-Claude] Univ Antwerp, Dept Biomed Sci, B-2020 Antwerp, Belgium; [Arevalo, Jorge; Adaui, Vanessa] Univ Peruana Cayetano Heredia, Fac Ciencias & Filosofia, Dept Ciencias Celulares & Mol, Lima, Peru","Adaui, V (reprint author), Univ Peruana Cayetano Heredia, Inst Med Trop Alexander von Humboldt, Lima, Peru.",vanessa.adaui@upch.pe,,,Internal Competitive Fund of Universidad Peruana Cayetano Heredia ("Fondo Concursable para Apoyo a la Investigacion en la UPCH"); Belgian Directorate General for Development Cooperation [95502],"This work was financially supported by an Internal Competitive Fund of Universidad Peruana Cayetano Heredia (""Fondo Concursable para Apoyo a la Investigacion en la UPCH-2011"") for covering working costs; and the Belgian Directorate General for Development Cooperation (FA3 project 95502) for personnel (MS, MJ, MA, VA) and facility support at the Molecular Epidemiology Unit of the Instituto de Medicina Tropical Alexander von Humboldt.

Cross-reactive and non-neutralizing antibodies against envelope (E) protein of DENV bind to the Fc gamma receptors (Fc gamma R) of cells, and thereby exacerbate viral infection by heterologous serotypes via antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE). Identification and modification of enhancing epitopes may mitigate enhancement of DENV infection. In this study, we characterized the cross-reactive DB21-6 and DB39-2 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against domain I-II of DENV; these antibodies poorly neutralized and potently enhanced DENV infection both in vitro and in vivo. In addition, two enhancing mAbs, DB21-6 and DB39-2, were observed to compete with sera antibodies from patients infected with dengue. The epitopes of these enhancing mAbs were identified using phage display, structural prediction, and mapping of virus-like particle (VLP) mutants. N8, R9, V12, and E13 are the reactive residues of DB21-6, while N8, R9, and E13 are the reactive residues of DB39-2. N8 substitution tends to maintain VLP secretion, and decreases the binding activity of DB21-6 and DB39-2. The immunized sera from N8 substitution (N8R) DNA vaccine exerted greater neutralizing and protective activity than wild-type (WT)-immunized sera, both in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, treatment with N8R-immunized sera reduced the enhancement of mortality in AG129 mice. These results support identification and substitution of enhancing epitope as a novel strategy for developing safe dengue vaccines.","[Tang, Chung-Tao; Wu, Han-Chung] Natl Def Med Ctr, Grad Inst Life Sci, Taipei, Taiwan; [Tang, Chung-Tao; Li, Pi-Chun; Liu, I-Ju; Liao, Mei-Ying; Chiu, Chiung-Yi; Wu, Han-Chung] Acad Sinica, Inst Cellular & Organism Biol, Taipei 115, Taiwan; [Chao, Day-Yu] Natl Chung Hsing Univ, Coll Vet Med, Grad Inst Microbiol Publ Hlth, Taichung 40227, Taiwan","Tang, CT (reprint author), Natl Def Med Ctr, Grad Inst Life Sci, Taipei, Taiwan.",hcw0928@gate.sinica.edu.tw,"Wu, Han-Chung/B-1209-2011","Wu, Han-Chung/0000-0002-5185-1169",,,,48,5,6,0,11,PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE,SAN FRANCISCO,"1160 BATTERY STREET, STE 100, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94111 USA",1935-2735,,,PLOS NEGLECT TROP D,Plos Neglect.

However, there is a consensus among the global health community, supported by mathematical modelling, that onchocerciasis in Africa will not be eliminated within proposed time frameworks in all endemic foci with only annual MDA, and novel and alternative strategies are urgently needed. Furthermore, use of MDA with ivermectin is already compromised in large areas of central Africa co-endemic with Loa loa, and there are areas where suboptimal or atypical responses to ivermectin have been documented. An onchocerciasis vaccine would be highly advantageous in these areas. Methodology/Principal Findings We used a previously developed onchocerciasis transmission model (EPIONCHO) to investigate the impact of vaccination in areas where loiasis and onchocerciasis are co-endemic and ivermectin is contraindicated. We also explore the potential influence of a vaccination programme on infection resurgence in areas where local elimination has been successfully achieved. Based on the age range included in the Expanded Programme on Immunization (EPI), the vaccine was assumed to target 1 to 5 year olds. Our modelling results indicate that the deployment of an onchocerciasis vaccine would have a beneficial impact in onchocerciasis-loiasis co-endemic areas, markedly reducing microfilarial load in the young (under 20 yr) age groups. Conclusions/Significance An onchocerciasis prophylactic vaccine would reduce the onchocerciasis disease burden in populations where ivermectin cannot be administered safely. Moreover, a vaccine could substantially decrease the chance of re-emergence of Onchocerca volvulus infection in areas where it is deemed that MDA with ivermectin can be stopped. Therefore, a vaccine would protect the substantial investments made by present and past onchocerciasis control programmes, decreasing the chance of disease recrudescence and offering an important additional tool to mitigate the potentially devastating impact of emerging ivermectin resistance.","[Turner, Hugo C.; Walker, Martin; Basanez, Maria-Gloria] Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Sch Publ Hlth, London Ctr Neglected Trop Dis Res, Dept Infect Dis Epidemiol,Fac Med, London, England; [Turner, Hugo C.; Walker, Martin; Basanez, Maria-Gloria] Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Infect Dis Epidemiol, Fac Med, London, England; [Lustigman, Sara] New York Blood Ctr, Lindsley F Kimball Res Inst, Mol Parasitol Lab, New York, NY 10021 USA; [Taylor, David W.] Univ Edinburgh, Sch Med, Div Infect & Pathway Med, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland","Basanez, MG (reprint author), Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Sch Publ Hlth, London Ctr Neglected Trop Dis Res, Dept Infect Dis Epidemiol,Fac Med, St Marys Campus, London, England.",m.basanez@imperial.ac.uk,,"Turner, Hugo/0000-0002-8428-3874; Walker, Martin/0000-0001-8714-5365","London Centre for Neglected Tropical Disease Research; Wellcome Trust [092677/Z/10/Z]; New York Blood Center intramural funds; European Commission Directorate General for Research Innovation [FP7 Health-2009-4.3.1-1, 242131]; Royal Society-Leverhulme Trust","HCT is funded by the London Centre for Neglected Tropical Disease Research (http://www.londonntd.org/); MW is funded by the Wellcome Trust (www.wellcome.ac.uk; grant 092677/Z/10/Z, to MGB); SL acknowledges funding by New York Blood Center intramural funds.

Leishmania major is the causative agent of cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL), which is largely characterized by ulcerative lesions appearing on the skin. Current treatments of leishmaniasis include penta-valent antimonials and amphotericin B, however, the toxic side effects of these drugs and difficulty with distribution makes these options less than ideal. Miltefosine (MIL) is the first oral treatment available for leishmaniasis. Originally developed for cancer chemotherapy, the mechanism of action of MIL in Leishmania spp. is largely unknown. While treatment with MIL has proven effective, higher tolerance to the drug has been observed, and resistance is easily developed in an in vitro environment. Utilizing stepwise selection we generated MIL-resistant cultures of L. major and characterized the fitness of MIL-resistant L. major. Resistant parasites proliferate at a comparable rate to the wild-type (WT) and exhibit similar apoptotic responses. As expected, MIL-resistant parasites demonstrate decreased susceptibility to MIL, which reduces after the drug is withdrawn from culture. Our data demonstrate metacyclogenesis is elevated in MIL-resistant L. major, albeit these parasites display attenuated in vitro and in vivo virulence and standard survival rates in the natural sandfly vector, indicating that development of experimental resistance to miltefosine does not lead to an increased competitive fitness in L. major.","[Turner, Kimbra G.; Vacchina, Paola; Robles-Murguia, Maricela; Wadsworth, Mariha; McDowell, Mary Ann; Morales, Miguel A.] Univ Notre Dame, Dept Biol Sci, Eck Inst Global Hlth, Notre Dame, IN 46556 USA","Turner, KG (reprint author), Univ Notre Dame, Dept Biol Sci, Eck Inst Global Hlth, Notre Dame, IN 46556 USA.",miguel.morales@nd.edu,,,Eck Institute for Global Health; University of Notre Dame,"This work was supported by the Eck Institute for Global Health and capitalization funds from the University of Notre Dame.

In 2010, a large-scale outbreak involving 601 cases of paratyphoid fever occurred in the whole of Yuanjiang county in China. Epidemiological and laboratory investigations were conducted to determine the etiology, source and transmission factors of the outbreak. Methodology/Principal Findings A case-control study was performed to identify the risk factors for this paratyphoid outbreak. Cases were identified as patients with blood culture-confirmed S. Paratyphi A infection. Controls were healthy persons without fever within the past month and matched to cases by age, gender and geography. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis and whole-genome sequencing of the S. Paratyphi A strains isolated from patients and environmental sources were performed to facilitate transmission analysis and source tracking. We found that farmers and young adults were the populations mainly affected in this outbreak, and the consumption of raw vegetables was the main risk factor associated with paratyphoid fever. Molecular sub-typing and genome sequencing of S. Paratyphi A isolates recovered from improperly disinfected hospital wastewater showed indistinguishable patterns matching most of the isolates from the cases. An investigation showed that hospital wastewater mixed with surface water was used for crop irrigation, promoting a cycle of contamination. After prohibition of the planting of vegetables in contaminated fields and the thorough disinfection of hospital wastewater, the outbreak subsided. Further analysis of the isolates indicated that the origin of the outbreak was most likely from patients outside Yuanjiang county. Conclusions This outbreak is an example of the combined effect of social behaviors, prevailing ecological conditions and improper disinfection of hospital wastewater on facilitating a sustained epidemic of paratyphoid fever. This study underscores the critical need for strict treatment measures of hospital wastewater and the maintenance of independent agricultural irrigation systems in rural areas.","[Yan, Meiying; Yang, Bo; Pang, Bo; Diao, Baowei; Kan, Biao] Chinese Ctr Dis Control & Prevent, Natl Inst Communicable Dis Control & Prevent, State Key Lab Infect Dis Prevent & Control, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Yan, Meiying; Yang, Bo; Pang, Bo; Diao, Baowei; Kan, Biao] Collaborat Innovat Ctr Diag & Treatment Infect Di, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Wang, Zhigang; Zhang, Xiaohe; Zhou, Yanhua; Yang, Rusong] Ctr Dis Control & Prevent Yuanjiang Cty, Kunming, Yunnan, Peoples R China; [Wang, Shukun] Ctr Dis Control & Prevent Yuxi City, Kunming, Yunnan, Peoples R China; [Wu, Shuyu; Klena, John D.] US Ctr Dis Control & Prevent, Int Emerging Infect Program, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Wu, Shuyu; Klena, John D.] Ctr Dis Control & Prevent, Global Dis Detect Branch, Div Global Hlth Protect, Ctr Global Hlth, Atlanta, GA USA","Yan, MY (reprint author), Chinese Ctr Dis Control & Prevent, Natl Inst Communicable Dis Control & Prevent, State Key Lab Infect Dis Prevent & Control, Beijing, Peoples R China.",kanbiao@icdc.cn,,,"Ministry of Science and Technology of the People's Republic of China [2012ZX10004215, 2008ZX10004-008]","This work was supported by the Priority Project on Infectious Disease Control and Prevention [BK grant numbers 2012ZX10004215, 2008ZX10004-008] from the Ministry of Science and Technology of the People's Republic of China.

Unlike in mammalian cells, DENV usually does not cause extremely deleterious effects on cells of mosquitoes. Despite this, clustered progeny virions were found to form infection foci in a high density cell culture. It is thus interesting to know how the virus spreads among cells in tissues such as the midgut within live mosquitoes. This report demonstrates that cell-to-cell spread is one way for DENV to infect neighboring cells without depending on the ""release and entry"" mode. In the meantime, a membrane-bound vacuole incorporating tetraspanin C189 was formed in response to DENV infection in the C6/36 cell and was subsequently transported along with the contained virus from one cell to another. Knockdown of C189 in DENV-infected C6/36 cells is shown herein to reduce cell-to-cell transmission of the virus, which may be recovered by co-transfection with a C189-expressing vector in DENV-infected C6/36 cells. Moreover, cell-to-cell transmission usually occurred at the site where the donor cell directly contacts the recipient cell. It suggested that C189 is crucially involved in the intercellular spread of progeny viral particles between mosquito cells. This novel finding presumably accounts for the rapid and efficient infection of DENV after its initial replication within tissues of the mosquito.","[Yang, Chao-Fu; Tu, Cheng-Hsun; Lo, Yin-Ping; Cheng, Chih-Chieh; Chen, Wei-June] Chang Gung Univ, Grad Inst Biomed Sci, Coll Med, Taoyuan, Taiwan; [Chen, Wei-June] Chang Gung Univ, Dept Publ Hlth & Parasitol, Coll Med, Taoyuan, Taiwan","Yang, CF (reprint author), Chang Gung Univ, Grad Inst Biomed Sci, Coll Med, Taoyuan, Taiwan.",wjchen@mail.cgu.edu.tw,,"Chen, Wei-June/0000-0002-2153-1893","Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan [MOST 103-2320-B-182-029-MY3]; Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Tao-Yuan, Taiwan [CMRPD1C0741similar to3]","This work was supported by: Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan (http://www.most.gov.tw/mp.aspx); MOST 103-2320-B-182-029-MY3 to WJC; and Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Tao-Yuan, Taiwan (http://www.cgmh.org.tw); CMRPD1C0741 similar to 3 to WJC.

There is at present no clear understanding of the exact mode(s) of transmission of M. ulcerans. Populations affected by Buruli ulcer are those living close to humid and swampy zones. The disease is associated with the creation or the extension of swampy areas, such as construction of dams or lakes for the development of agriculture. Currently, it is supposed that insects (water bugs and mosquitoes) are host and vector of M. ulcerans. The role of water bugs was clearly demonstrated by several experimental and environmental studies. However, no definitive conclusion can yet be drawn concerning the precise importance of this route of transmission. Concerning the mosquitoes, DNA was detected only in mosquitoes collected in Australia, and their role as host/vector was never studied by experimental approaches. Surprisingly, no specific study was conducted in Africa. In this context, the objective of this study was to investigate the role of mosquitoes (larvae and adults) and other flying insects in ecology of M. ulcerans. This study was conducted in a highly endemic area of Benin. Methodology/Principal Findings Mosquitoes (adults and larvae) were collected over one year, in Buruli ulcer endemic in Benin. In parallel, to monitor the presence of M. ulcerans in environment, aquatic insects were sampled. QPCR was used to detected M. ulcerans DNA. DNA of M. ulcerans was detected in around 8.7% of aquatic insects but never in mosquitoes (larvae or adults) or in other flying insects. Conclusion/Significance This study suggested that the mosquitoes don't play a pivotal role in the ecology and transmission of M. ulcerans in the studied endemic areas. However, the role of mosquitoes cannot be excluded and, we can reasonably suppose that several routes of transmission of M. ulcerans are possible through the world.","[Zogo, Barnabas; Djenontin, Armel] IRD CREC Cotonou, Cotonou, Benin; [Zogo, Barnabas; Djenontin, Armel] Univ Abomey Calavi, Cotonou, Benin; [Carolan, Kevin; Guegan, Jean-Francois] Univ Montpellier I, CNRS, UMR MIVEGEC, IRD, Montpellier, France; [Carolan, Kevin; Guegan, Jean-Francois] Univ Montpellier 2, Montpellier, France; [Babonneau, Jeremy; Marion, Estelle] Univ Angers, Inserm Avenir Team, ATOMycA, CRCNA,Inserm U892,CNRS 6299, Angers, France; [Babonneau, Jeremy; Marion, Estelle] CHU Angers, Angers, France; [Eyangoh, Sara] Ctr Pasteur Cameroun, Lab Mycobacteriol, Yaounde, Cameroon; [Marion, Estelle] Fdn Raoul Follereau, Ctr Diagnost & Traitement Ulcere Buruli, Pobe, Benin","Marion, E (reprint author), Univ Angers, Inserm Avenir Team, ATOMycA, CRCNA,Inserm U892,CNRS 6299, Angers, France.",estelle.marion@inserm.fr,"Marion, Estelle/G-3437-2016; Guegan, Jean-Francois/F-4346-2012","Marion, Estelle/0000-0003-4917-9665; Guegan, Jean-Francois/0000-0002-7218-107X",Fondation Raoul Follereau; Institut National de la sante et de la recherche Medicale (Inserm Avenir); Agence Nationale de la rcherche contre le Sida et les hepatites; Iinstitut de Recherche pour le developpement (IRD); Universite d'Angers; Agence Nationale de la recherche (ANR),"This study was supported by Fondation Raoul Follereau, Institut National de la sante et de la recherche Medicale (Inserm Avenir), Agence Nationale de la rcherche contre le Sida et les hepatites, Iinstitut de Recherche pour le developpement (IRD), Universite d'Angers, and Agence Nationale de la recherche (ANR).

Burkholderia species are reportedly ""highly resistant"" to antimicrobial agents, including cyclic peptide antibiotics, due to multiple resistance systems, a hypothesis we decided to test using antimicrobial (host defense) peptides. In this study, a number of cationic antimicrobial peptides (CAMPs) were tested in vitro against B. thailandensis for both antimicrobial activity and inhibition of biofilm formation. Here, we report that the Chinese cobra (Naja atra) cathelicidin NA-CATH was significantly antimicrobial against B. thailandensis. Additional cathelicidins, including the human cathelicidin LL-37, a sheep cathelicidin SMAP-29, and some smaller ATRA peptide derivatives of NA-CATH were also effective. The D-enantiomer of one small peptide (ATRA-1A) was found to be antimicrobial as well, with EC50 in the range of the L-enantiomer. Our results also demonstrate that human alpha-defensins (HNP-1 & -2) and a short beta-defensin-derived peptide (Peptide 4 of hBD-3) were not bactericidal against B. thailandensis. We also found that the cathelicidin peptides, including LL-37, NA-CATH, and SMAP-29, possessed significant ability to prevent biofilm formation of B. thailandensis. Additionally, we show that LL-37 and its D-enantiomer D-LL-37 can disperse preformed biofilms. These results demonstrate that although B. thailandensis is highly resistant to many antibiotics, cyclic peptide antibiotics such as polymyxin B, and defensing peptides, some antimicrobial peptides including the elapid snake cathelicidin NA-CATH exert significant antimicrobial and antibiofilm activity towards B. thailandensis.","[Blower, Ryan J.; Barksdale, Stephanie M.; van Hoek, Monique L.] George Mason Univ, Sch Syst Biol, Manassas, VA 20110 USA; [van Hoek, Monique L.] George Mason Univ, Natl Ctr Biodef & Infect Dis, Manassas, VA USA","Blower, RJ (reprint author), George Mason Univ, Sch Syst Biol, Manassas, VA 20110 USA.",mvanhoek@gmu.edu,"van Hoek, Monique/E-1629-2011","van Hoek, Monique/0000-0003-1679-4899",Defense Threat Reduction Agency [HDTRA1-12-C-0039],"RJB, SMB, and MLvH were supported by HDTRA1-12-C-0039 ""Translational Peptide Research for Personnel Protection"" from the Defense Threat Reduction Agency.

The human burden approaches 400 million infections annually. Complex transmission dynamics pose challenges for predicting location, timing, and magnitude of risk; thus, models are needed to guide prevention strategies and policy development locally and globally. Weather regulates transmission-potential via its effects on vector dynamics. An important gap in understanding risk and roadblock in model development is an empirical perspective clarifying how weather impacts transmission in diverse ecological settings. We sought to determine if location, timing, and potential-intensity of transmission are systematically defined by weather. Methodology/Principal Findings We developed a high-resolution empirical profile of the local weather-disease connection across Peru, a country with considerable ecological diversity. Applying 2-dimensional weather-space that pairs temperature versus humidity, we mapped local transmission-potential in weather-space by week during 1994-2012. A binary classification-tree was developed to test whether weather data could classify 1828 Peruvian districts as positive/negative for transmission and into ranks of transmission-potential with respect to observed disease. We show that transmission-potential is regulated by temperature-humidity coupling, enabling epidemics in a limited area of weather-space. Duration within a specific temperature range defines transmission-potential that is amplified exponentially in higher humidity. Dengue-positive districts were identified by mean temperature >22 degrees C for 7+ weeks and minimum temperature >14 degrees C for 33+ weeks annually with 95% sensitivity and specificity. In elevated-risk locations, seasonal peak-incidence occurred when mean temperature was 26-29 degrees C, coincident with humidity at its local maximum; highest incidence when humidity >80%. We profile transmission-potential in weather-space for temperature-humidity ranging 0-38 degrees C and 5-100% at 1 degrees C x 2% resolution. Conclusions/Significance Local duration in limited areas of temperature-humidity weather-space identifies potential locations, timing, and magnitude of transmission. The weather-space profile of transmission-potential provides needed data that define a systematic and highly-sensitive weather-disease connection, demonstrating separate but coupled roles of temperature and humidity. New insights regarding natural regulation of human-mosquito transmission across diverse ecological settings advance our understanding of risk locally and globally for dengue and other mosquito-borne diseases and support advances in public health policy/operations, providing an evidence-base for modeling, predicting risk, and surveillance-prevention planning.","[Campbell, Karen M.; Haldeman, Kristin; Lehnig, Chris] San Diego State Univ, Computat Sci Res Ctr, San Diego, CA 92182 USA; [Munayco, Cesar V.] Uniformed Serv Univ Hlth Sci, Dept Prevent Med & Biometr, Bethesda, MD 20814 USA; [Halsey, Eric S.] US Naval Med Res Unit 6, Lima, Peru; [Laguna-Torres, V.

SIT using self-limiting genetic technology is one such promising method. A self-limiting strain of Aedes aegypti, OX513A, has already reached the stage of field evaluation. Sustained releases of OX513A Ae. aegypti males led to 80% suppression of a target wild Ae. aegypti population in the Cayman Islands in 2010. Here we describe sustained series of field releases of OX513A Ae. aegypti males in a suburb of Juazeiro, Bahia, Brazil. This study spanned over a year and reduced the local Ae. aegypti population by 95% (95% CI: 92.2%-97.5%) based on adult trap data and 81% (95% CI: 74.9-85.2%) based on ovitrap indices compared to the adjacent no-release control area. The mating competitiveness of the released males (0.031; 95% CI: 0.025-0.036) was similar to that estimated in the Cayman trials (0.059; 95% CI: 0.011 - 0.210), indicating that environmental and target-strain differences had little impact on the mating success of the OX513A males. We conclude that sustained release of OX513A males may be an effective and widely useful method for suppression of the key dengue vector Ae. aegypti. The observed level of suppression would likely be sufficient to prevent dengue epidemics in the locality tested and other areas with similar or lower transmission.","[Carvalho, Danilo O.; McKemey, Andrew R.; Lacroix, Renaud; Alphey, Luke] Oxitec Ltd, Abingdon, Oxon, England; [Carvalho, Danilo O.; Capurro, Margareth L.] Univ Sao Paulo, Inst Ciencias Biomed, Dept Parasitol, BR-05508 Sao Paulo, Brazil; [Garziera, Luiza; Malavasi, Aldo] Moscamed Brasil, Juazeiro, BA, Brazil; [Donnelly, Christl A.] Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, MRC, Ctr Outbreak Anal & Modelling, Dept Infect Dis Epidemiol,Fac Med, London, England; [Alphey, Luke] Univ Oxford, Dept Zool, Oxford OX1 3PS, England; [Alphey, Luke] Pirbright Inst, Woking, Surrey, England; [Capurro, Margareth L.] Inst Nacl Ciencia & Tecnol Entomol Mol, Rio De Janeiro, Brazil","Carvalho, DO (reprint author), Oxitec Ltd, Abingdon, Oxon, England.",andrew.mckemey@oxitec.com,"Capurro, Margareth/M-5286-2019","Donnelly, Christl/0000-0002-0195-2463; Carvalho, Danilo Oliveira/0000-0001-8168-4050; Alphey, Luke/0000-0002-2916-3802",Biofabrica Moscamed Brasil; Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo; Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologia; Medical Research Council,"AM and LG received support from Biofabrica Moscamed Brasil (www.moscamed.org.br.

Recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA) assays using a lateral flow test (RPA-nfo) and real-time fluorescent detection (RPA-exo) were developed targeting the 47-kDa gene of O. tsutsugamushi or 17 kDa gene of R. typhi. The RPA assay was capable of detecting O. tsutsugamushi or R. typhi at levels comparable to that of the quantitative PCR method. Both the RPA-nfo and RPA-exo methods performed similarly with regards to sensitivity when detecting the 17 kDa gene of R. typhi. On the contrary, RPA-exo performed better than RPA-nfo in detecting the 47 kDa gene of O. tsutsugamushi. The clinical performance of the O. tsutsugamushi RPA assay was evaluated using either human patient samples or infected mouse samples. Eight out of ten PCR confirmed positives were determined positive by RPA, and all PCR confirmed negative samples were negative by RPA. Similar results were obtained for R. typhi spiked patient sera. The assays were able to differentiate O. tsutsugamushi and R. typhi from other phylogenetically related bacteria as well as mouse and human DNA. Furthermore, the RPA-nfo reaction was completed in 20 minutes at 37 degrees C followed by a 10 minute incubation at room temperature for development of an immunochromatographic strip. The RPA-exo reaction was completed in 20 minutes at 39 degrees C. The implementation of a cross contamination proof cassette to detect the RPA-nfo fluorescent amplicons provided an alternative to regular lateral flow detection strips, which are more prone to cross contamination. The RPA assays provide a highly time-efficient, sensitive and specific alternative to other methods for diagnosing scrub typhus or murine typhus.","[Chao, Chien-Chung; Ching, Wei-Mei] Naval Med Res Ctr, Viral & Rickettsial Dis Dept, Infect Dis Directorate, Silver Spring, MD 20910 USA; [Chao, Chien-Chung; Belinskaya, Tatyana; Zhang, Zhiwen; Ching, Wei-Mei] Uniformed Serv Univ Hlth Sci, Bethesda, MD 20814 USA","Chao, CC (reprint author), Naval Med Res Ctr, Viral & Rickettsial Dis Dept, Infect Dis Directorate, Silver Spring, MD 20910 USA.",chien-chung.c.chao.civ@mail.mil,,,"Military Infectious Diseases Research Program [6000.RAD1.J.A0310, L0224_10_NM]","This work was supported by Work Unit Number (WUN) 6000.RAD1.J.A0310.

In this paper we use data from a nationwide survey to address these issues. Methodology Our analyses are based on data arising from the integrated mapping of podoconiosis and lymphatic filariasis (LF) conducted in 2013, supplemented by data from an earlier mapping of LF in western Ethiopia in 2008-2010. The integrated mapping used woreda (district) health offices' reports of podoconiosis and LF to guide selection of survey sites. A suite of environmental and climatic data and boosted regression tree (BRT) modelling was used to investigate environmental limits and predict the probability of podoconiosis occurrence. Principal Findings Data were available for 141,238 individuals from 1,442 communities in 775 districts from all nine regional states and two city administrations of Ethiopia. In 41.9% of surveyed districts no cases of podoconiosis were identified, with all districts in Affar, Dire Dawa, Somali and Gambella regional states lacking the disease. The disease was most common, with lymphoedema positivity rate exceeding 5%, in the central highlands of Ethiopia, in Amhara, Oromia and Southern Nations, Nationalities and Peoples regional states. BRT modelling indicated that the probability of podoconiosis occurrence increased with increasing altitude, precipitation and silt fraction of soil and decreased with population density and clay content. Based on the BRT model, we estimate that in 2010, 34.9 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 20.2-51.7) million people (i.e. 43.8%; 95% CI: 25.3-64.8% of Ethiopia's national population) lived in areas environmentally suitable for the occurrence of podoconiosis. Conclusions Podoconiosis is more widespread in Ethiopia than previously estimated, but occurs in distinct geographical regions that are tied to identifiable environmental factors. The resultant maps can be used to guide programme planning and implementation and estimate disease burden in Ethiopia. This work provides a framework with which the geographical limits of podoconiosis could be delineated at a continental scale.","[Deribe, Kebede; Newport, Melanie J.; Davey, Gail] Brighton & Sussex Med Sch, Brighton, E Sussex, England; [Deribe, Kebede; Enquselassie, Fikre] Univ Addis Ababa, Sch Publ Hlth, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia; [Cano, Jorge; Pullan, Rachel L.; Reithinger, Richard; Brooker, Simon J.] London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, Fac Infect & Trop Dis, London WC1, England; [Golding, Nick; Hay, Simon I.] Univ Oxford, Wellcome Trust Ctr Human Genet, Oxford, England; [Sime, Heven; Gebretsadik, Abeba; Assefa, Ashenafi; Kebede, Amha] Ethiopian Publ Hlth Inst, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia; [Hailu, Asrat] Univ Addis Ababa, Sch Med, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia; [Rebollo, Maria P.; Bockarie, Moses J.] Univ Liverpool, Liverpool Sch Trop Med, Ctr Neglected Trop Dis, Liverpool L3 5QA, Merseyside, England; [Shafi, Oumer] Fed Minist Hlth, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia; [Aseffa, Abraham] Armauer Hansen Res Inst ALERT, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia; [Hay, Simon I.] Univ Washington, Inst Hlth Metr & Evaluat, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Hay, Simon I.] NIH, Fogarty Int Ctr, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; [Reithinger, Richard] RTI Int, Washington, DC USA","Deribe, K (reprint author), Brighton & Sussex Med Sch, Brighton, E Sussex, England.",kebededeka@yahoo.com,"Aseffa, Abraham/J-3248-2016; Cano, Jorge/E-2962-2016; Hay, Simon/F-8967-2015","Aseffa, Abraham/0000-0002-8028-1150; Golding, Nick/0000-0001-8916-5570; Cano, Jorge/0000-0001-9864-5058; Hay, Simon/0000-0002-0611-7272; Newport, Melanie/0000-0002-8946-7525; Deribe, Kebede/0000-0002-8526-6996","Wellcome Trust [099876, 091956, 098045, 095066]; Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation [OPP1093011]; RAPIDD program of the Science & Technology Directorate, Department of Homeland Security; Fogarty International Center, National Institutes of Health; Medical Research Council [G1001337]","This study was financially supported by The Wellcome Trust [grant number 099876].

The disease is thought to be contracted by eating raw fish, a staple of many South-East Asian cuisines. In 2009, the first patient with sennetsu was identified in the Lao PDR (Laos), raising the question as to how common this organism and related species are in patients presenting with fever. We investigated the frequency of N. sennetsu infection at hospitals in diverse areas of Laos. Consenting febrile hospital inpatients from central (Vientiane: n = 1,013), northern (Luang Namtha: n = 453) and southern (Salavan: n = 171) Laos were screened by PCR for N. sennetsu, if no previous positive direct diagnostic test was available. A PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism assay was developed to differentiate between N. sennetsu, Ehrlichia chaffeensis and Anaplasma phagocytophilum. To allow more detailed studies of N. sennetsu, culture was successfully established using a reference strain (ATCC VR-367), identifying a canine-macrophage cell line (DH82) to be most suitable to visually identify infection. After screening, N. sennetsu was identified and sequence confirmed in four (4/1,637; 0.2%) Lao patients. Despite the previously identified high seroprevalence of N. sennetsu antibodies in the Lao population (similar to 17%), acute N. sennetsu infection with sufficient clinical signs to prompt hospitalization appears to be rare. The reservoir, zoonotic cycle and pathogenicity of N. sennetsu remain unclear and require further investigations.","[Dittrich, Sabine; Phuklia, Weerawat; Rattanavong, Sayaphet; Chansamouth, Vilada; Newton, Paul N.] Mahosot Hosp, Microbiol Lab, Lao Oxford Mahosot Hosp Wellcome Trust Res Unit L, Viangchan, Laos; [Dittrich, Sabine; Turner, Gareth D.

Microscopic examination of urine samples to detect parasite eggs still remains as definitive diagnosis. This work was focussed on developing a novel loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assay for detection of S. haematobium DNA in human urine samples as a high-throughput, simple, accurate and affordable diagnostic tool to use in diagnosis of urogenital schistosomiasis. Methodology/Principal Findings A LAMP assay targeting a species specific sequence of S. haematobium ribosomal intergenic spacer was designed. The effectiveness of our LAMP was assessed in a number of patients' urine samples with microscopy confirmed S. haematobium infection. For potentially large-scale application in field conditions, different DNA extraction methods, including a commercial kit, a modified NaOH extraction method and a rapid heating method were tested using small volumes of urine fractions (whole urine, supernatants and pellets). The heating of pellets from clinical samples was the most efficient method to obtain good-quality DNA detectable by LAMP. The detection limit of our LAMP was 1 fg/mu L of S. haematobium DNA in urine samples. When testing all patients ' urine samples included in our study, diagnostic parameters for sensitivity and specificity were calculated for LAMP assay, 100% sensitivity (95% CI: 81.32%-100%) and 86.67% specificity (95% CI: 75.40%-94.05%), and also for microscopy detection of eggs in urine samples, 69.23% sensitivity (95% CI: 48.21% -85.63%) and 100% specificity (95% CI: 93.08%-100%). Conclusions/Significance We have developed and evaluated, for the first time, a LAMP assay for detection of S. haematobium DNA in heated pellets from patients' urine samples using no complicated requirement procedure for DNA extraction. The procedure has been named the Rapid-Heat LAMPellet method and has the potential to be developed further as a field diagnostic tool for use in urogenital schistosomiasis-endemic areas.","[Gandasegui, Javier; Fernandez-Soto, Pedro; Vicente, Belen; Lopez-Aban, Julio; Muro, Antonio] Univ Salamanca, Inst Invest Biomed Salamanca, Ctr Invest Enfermedades Trop, IBSAL CIETUS,Fac Farm, E-37008 Salamanca, Spain; [Carranza-Rodriguez, Cristina; Luis Perez-Arellano, Jose] Univ Las Palmas Gran Canaria, Fac Ciencias Salud, Dept Ciencias Med & Quirurg, Las Palmas Gran Canaria, Spain","Gandasegui, J (reprint author), Univ Salamanca, Inst Invest Biomed Salamanca, Ctr Invest Enfermedades Trop, IBSAL CIETUS,Fac Farm, E-37008 Salamanca, Spain.",pfsoto@usal.es,"Gandasegui, Javier/D-7895-2019; Lopez-Aban, Julio/B-3557-2015; Carranza, Cristina/K-9578-2016; PEREZ-ARELLANO, JOSE-LUIS/E-1565-2019","Gandasegui, Javier/0000-0001-5519-738X; Lopez-Aban, Julio/0000-0001-8509-0727; Muro, Antonio/0000-0003-0244-4740; PEREZ-ARELLANO, JOSE-LUIS/0000-0002-2936-8242",Real Federacion Espanola de Futbol-Sociedad Espanola de Medicina Tropical y Salud Internacional (RFEF-SEMTSI); Junta de Castilla y Leon [SA342U13],"This work was supported by Real Federacion Espanola de Futbol-Sociedad Espanola de Medicina Tropical y Salud Internacional, 2013 (RFEF-SEMTSI, 2013) and by Junta de Castilla y Leon (Ref. no.

This study aimed to investigate the pharmacokinetics of an Indian snake antivenom in humans with Russell's viper bites. Methods/Principal Findings Patient data and serial blood samples were collected from patients with Russell's viper (Daboia russelii) envenoming in Sri Lanka. All patients received Indian F(ab')(2) snake antivenom manufactured by VINS Bioproducts Ltd. Antivenom concentrations were measured with sandwich enzyme immunoassays. Timed antivenom concentrations were analysed using MONOLIXvs4.2. One, two and three compartment models with zero order input and first order elimination kinetics were assessed. Models were parameterized with clearance (CL), intercompartmental clearance(Q), central compartment volume(V) and peripheral compartment volume(VP). Between-subject-variability (BSV) on relative bioavailability (F) was included to account for dose variations. Covariates effects (age, sex, weight, antivenom batch, pre-antivenom concentrations) were explored by visual inspection and in model building. There were 75 patients, median age 57 years (40-70y) and 64 (85%) were male. 411 antivenom concentration data points were analysed. A two compartment model with zero order input, linear elimination kinetics and a combined error model best described the data. Inclusion of BSV on F and weight as a covariate on V improved the model. Inclusion of pre-antivenom concentrations or different batches on BSV of F did not. Final model parameter estimates were CL,0.078 Lh(-1), V,2.2L, Q,0.178Lh(-1) and V-P,8.33L. The median half-life of distribution was 4.6h (10-90%iles:2.6-7.1h) and half-life of elimination, 140h (10th-90th percentilesx: 95-223h).

This study aimed to examine whether specific characteristics of an urban slum community were associated with the risk of dengue disease. Methodology/Principal Findings From 01/2009 to 12/2010, we conducted enhanced, community-based surveillance in the only public emergency unit in a slum in Salvador, Brazil to identify acute febrile illness (AFI) patients with laboratory evidence of dengue infection. Patient households were geocoded within census tracts (CTs). Demographic, socioeconomic, and geographical data were obtained from the 2010 national census. Associations between CTs characteristics and the spatial risk of both dengue and non-dengue AFI were assessed by Poisson log-normal and conditional auto-regressive models (CAR). We identified 651 (22.0%) dengue cases among 2,962 AFI patients. Estimated risk of symptomatic dengue was 21.3 and 70.2 cases per 10,000 inhabitants in 2009 and 2010, respectively. All the four dengue serotypes were identified, but DENV2 predominated (DENV1: 8.1%; DENV2: 90.7%; DENV3: 0.4%; DENV4: 0.8%). Multivariable CAR regression analysis showed increased dengue risk in CTs with poorer inhabitants (RR: 1.02 for each percent increase in the frequency of families earning <= 1 times the minimum wage; 95% CI: 1.01-1.04), and decreased risk in CTs located farther from the health unit (RR: 0.87 for each 100 meter increase; 95% CI: 0.80-0.94). The same CTs characteristics were also associated with non-dengue AFI risk. Conclusions/Significance This study highlights the large burden of symptomatic dengue on individuals living in urban slums in Brazil. Lower neighborhood socioeconomic status was independently associated with increased risk of dengue, indicating that within slum communities with high levels of absolute poverty, factors associated with the social gradient influence dengue transmission. In addition, poor geographic access to health services may be a barrier to identifying both dengue and non-dengue AFI cases. Therefore, further spatial studies should account for this potential source of bias.","[Kikuti, Mariana; Paploski, Igor A. D.; Kasper, Amelia M.; Silva, Monaise M.

The data available to estimate the overall CFR are often gathered for other purposes (e.g., surveillance) in challenging circumstances. We describe two forms of bias that may affect the estimation of the overall CFR-preferential ascertainment of severe cases and bias from reporting delays-and review solutions that have been proposed and implemented in past epidemics. Also of interest is the estimation of the causal impact of specific interventions (e.g., hospitalization, or hospitalization at a particular hospital) on survival, which can be estimated as a relative CFR for two or more groups. When observational data are used for this purpose, three more sources of bias may arise: confounding, survivorship bias, and selection due to preferential inclusion in surveillance datasets of those who are hospitalized and/or die. We illustrate these biases and caution against causal interpretation of differential CFR among those receiving different interventions in observational datasets. Again, we discuss ways to reduce these biases, particularly by estimating outcomes in smaller but more systematically defined cohorts ascertained before the onset of symptoms, such as those identified by forward contact tracing. Finally, we discuss the circumstances in which these biases may affect non-causal interpretation of risk factors for death among cases.","[Lipsitch, Marc; Hernan, Miguel A.] Harvard Univ, TH Chan Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Epidemiol, Ctr Communicable Dis Dynam, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Lipsitch, Marc] Harvard Univ, TH Chan Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Immunol & Infect Dis, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Lipsitch, Marc; Donnelly, Christl A.; Fraser, Christophe; Blake, Isobel M.; Cori, Anne; Dorigatti, Ilaria; Ferguson, Neil M.; Garske, Tini; Mills, Harriet L.; Riley, Steven; Van Kerkhove, Maria D.] Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, MRC, Ctr Outbreak Anal & Modelling, Dept Infect Dis Epidemiol, London, England; [Van Kerkhove, Maria D.] Inst Pasteur, Ctr Global Hlth, Paris, France; [Hernan, Miguel A.] Harvard Univ, TH Chan Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Biostat, Boston, MA 02115 USA","Lipsitch, M (reprint author), Harvard Univ, TH Chan Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Epidemiol, Ctr Communicable Dis Dynam, Boston, MA 02115 USA.",mlipsitc@hsph.harvard.edu,"Fraser, Christophe/A-8109-2008; Ferguson, Neil/B-8578-2008","Fraser, Christophe/0000-0003-2399-9657; Ferguson, Neil/0000-0002-1154-8093; Donnelly, Christl/0000-0002-0195-2463; Van Kerkhove, Maria/0000-0002-6135-0018; Cori, Anne/0000-0002-8443-9162; Riley, Steven/0000-0001-7904-4804; Dorigatti, Ilaria/0000-0001-9959-0706; Blake, Isobel/0000-0002-3977-1318","National Institute Of General Medical Sciences of the US National Institutes of Health [U54GM088558]; Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation; European Union [278433-PREDEMICS]; UK Medical Research Council; Medical Research Council [MR/K010174/1B, MR/K010174/1, MR/J008761/1]; National Institute for Health Research [NF-SI-0508-10252]","Research reported in this publication was supported by the National Institute Of General Medical Sciences of the US National Institutes of Health under Award Number U54GM088558.

Drug repurposing might be an inexpensive and effective source of novel antischistosomal leads. Methodology 1600 FDA approved compounds were first assayed against Schistosoma mansoni schistosomula at a concentration of 10 mu M. Active compounds identified from this screen were advanced to the adult worm screen at 33.33 mu M, followed by hit characterization. Leads with complementary pharmacokinetic and toxicity profiles were then selected for in vivo studies. Principal Findings The in vitro screen identified 121 and 36 compounds active against the schistosomula and adult stage, respectively. Further, in vitro characterization and comparison with already available pharmacokinetic and toxicity data identified 11 in vivo candidates. Doramectin (10 mg/kg) and clofazimine (400 mg/kg) were found to be active in vivo with worm burden reductions of 60.1% and 82.7%, respectively. Conclusions/Significance The work presented here expands the knowledge of antischistosomal properties of already approved compounds and underscores variations observed between target-based and phenotypic approaches and among laboratories.

Few epidemiological studies have examined the extent of transmission of these infections in South India despite an increase in the number of reported cases, and a high suitability for transmission. Methods and findings We conducted a household-based seroprevalence survey among 1010 individuals aged 540 years living in fifty randomly selected spatial locations in Chennai, Tamil Nadu. Participants were asked to provide a venous blood sample and to complete a brief questionnaire with basic demographic and daily activity information. Previous exposure to dengue and chikungunya was determined using IgG indirect ELISA (Panbio) and IgG ELISA (Novatec), respectively. We used this data to estimate key transmission parameters (force of infection and basic reproductive number) and to explore factors associated with seropositivity. While only 1% of participants reported history of dengue and 20% of chikungunya, we found that 93% (95%CI 89-95%) of participants were seropositive to dengue virus, and 44% (95%CI 37-50%) to chikungunya. Age-specific seroprevalence was consistent with long-tem, endemic circulation of dengue and suggestive of epidemic chikungunya transmission. Seropositivity to dengue and chikungunya were significantly correlated, even after adjusting for individual and household factors. We estimate that 23% of the susceptible population gets infected by dengue each year, corresponding to approximately 228,000 infections. This transmission intensity is significantly higher than that estimated in known hyperendemic settings in Southeast Asia and the Americas. Conclusions These results provide unprecedented insight into the very high transmission potential of dengue and chikungunya in Chennai and underscore the need for enhanced surveillance and control methods.","[Rodriguez-Barraquer, Isabel; Solomon, Sunil S.; Mehta, Shruti H.; Cummings, Derek A.

Extensive research shows that oxidative stress (OS) plays a critical role in the transition from chronic O. viverrini infection to CCA. OS also results in the excision of a modified DNA lesion (8-oxodG) into urine, the levels of which can be detected by immunoassay. Herein, we measured concentrations of urine 8-oxodG by immunoassay from the following four groups in the Khon Kaen Cancer Cohort study: (1) O. viverrini negative individuals, (2) O. viverrini positive individuals with no APF as determined by abdominal ultrasound, (3) O. viverrini positive individuals with APF as determined by abdominal ultrasound, and (4) O. viverrini induced cases of CCA. A logistic regression model was used to evaluate the utility of creatinine-adjusted urinary 8-oxodG among these groups, along with demographic, behavioral, and immunological risk factors. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was used to evaluate the predictive accuracy of urinary 8-oxodG for APF and CCA. Elevated concentrations of 8-oxodG in urine positively associated with APF and CCA in a strongly dose-dependent manner. Urinary 8-oxodG concentrations also accurately predicted whether an individual presented with APF or CCA compared to O. viverrini infected individuals without these pathologies. In conclusion, urinary 8-oxodG is a robust 'candidate' biomarker of the progression of APF and CCA from chronic opisthorchiasis, which is indicative of the critical role that OS plays in both of these advanced hepatobiliary pathologies.

This parasitic disease is due to immunologic reactions to Schistosoma eggs trapped in tissues. Egg-released antigens stimulate tissue-destructive inflammatory and granulomatous reactions, involving different immune cell populations, including T cells and granulocytes. Granulomas lead to collagen fibers deposition and fibrosis, resulting in organ damage. Praziquantel (PZQ) is the drug of choice for treating all species of schistosomes. However, PZQ kills only adult Schistosoma worms, not immature stages. The inability of PZQ to abort early infection or prevent re-infection, and the lack of prophylactic effect prompt the need for novel drugs and strategies for the prevention of schistosomiasis. Methodology/Principal Findings Using in vitro and in vivo approaches, we have found that the alkylphospholipid analog edelfosine kills schistosomula, and displays anti-inflammatory activity. The combined treatment of PZQ and edelfosine during a few days before and after cercariae infection in a schistosomiasis mouse model, simulating a prophylactic treatment, led to seven major effects: a) killing of Schistosoma parasites at early and late development stages; b) reduction of hepatomegaly; c) granuloma size reduction; d) down-regulation of Th1, Th2 and Th17 responses at late post-infection times, thus inhibiting granuloma formation; e) upregulation of IL-10 at early post-infection times, thus potentiating anti-inflammatory actions; f) down-regulation of IL-10 at late post-infection times, thus favoring resistance to re-infection; g) reduction in the number of blood granulocytes in late post-infection times as compared to infected untreated animals. Conclusions/Significance Taken together, these data suggest that the combined treatment of PZQ and edelfosine promotes a high decrease in granuloma formation, as well as in the cellular immune response that underlies granuloma development, with changes in the cytokine patterns, and may provide a promising and effective strategy for a prophylactic treatment of schistosomiasis.","[Yepes, Edward; Lopez-Aban, Julio; Rojas-Caraballo, Jose; Muro, Antonio] Univ Salamanca, Fac Farm, IBSAL CIETUS Inst Invest Biomed Salamanca Ctr Inv, E-37007 Salamanca, Spain; [Yepes, Edward; Varela-M, Ruben E.; Mollinedo, Faustino] Univ Salamanca, CSIC, Inst Biol Mol & Celular Canc, Ctr Invest Canc, E-37008 Salamanca, Spain; [Mollinedo, Faustino] Hosp Univ Salamanca, Inst Invest Biomed Salamanca IBSAL, Salamanca, Spain","Yepes, E (reprint author), Univ Salamanca, Fac Farm, IBSAL CIETUS Inst Invest Biomed Salamanca Ctr Inv, E-37007 Salamanca, Spain.",fmollin@usal.es,"Lopez-Aban, Julio/B-3557-2015","Lopez-Aban, Julio/0000-0001-8509-0727; VARELA MIRANDA, RUBEN EDUARDO/0000-0002-1635-0166; Muro, Antonio/0000-0003-0244-4740; Yepes, Edward/0000-0003-0361-9370","Junta de Castilla y Leon [SA342U13, CSI052A11-2, CSI221A12-2]; Real Federacion Espanola de Futbol-Sociedad Espanola de Medicina Tropical y Salud Internacional (RFEF-SEMTSI); Spanish Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad from Red Tematica de Investigacion Cooperativa en Cancer, Instituto de Salud Carlos III [SAF2011-30518, SAF2014-59716-R, RD12/0036/0065]; Fondo Europeo de Desarrollo Regional of the European Union; European Community [HEALTH-F2-2011-256986]","This work was supported by grants from the Junta de Castilla y Leon (SA342U13, CSI052A11-2, and CSI221A12-2), Real Federacion Espanola de Futbol-Sociedad Espanola de Medicina Tropical y Salud Internacional (RFEF-SEMTSI 2013), Spanish Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad (SAF2011-30518, SAF2014-59716-R, and RD12/0036/0065 from Red Tematica de Investigacion Cooperativa en Cancer, Instituto de Salud Carlos III, cofunded by the Fondo Europeo de Desarrollo Regional of the European Union), and European Community's Seventh Framework Programme FP7-2007-2013 (grant HEALTH-F2-2011-256986, PANACREAS).

The placental changes that lead to some of these detrimental outcomes have been studied, but the mechanisms that lead to these changes are still not fully elucidated. There is some indication that imbalances in cytokine cascades, complement activation and angiogenic dysregulation might be involved in the placental changes observed. Nevertheless, the majority of studies on malaria in pregnancy (MiP) have come from areas where malaria transmission is high and usually restricted to Plasmodium falciparum, the most pathogenic of the malaria parasite species. We conducted a cross-sectional study in Cruzeiro do Sul, Acre state, Brazil, an area of low transmission and where both P. vivax and P. falciparum circulate. We collected peripheral and placental blood and placental biopsies, at delivery from 137 primigravid women and measured levels of the angiogenic factors angiopoietin (Ang)-1, Ang-2, their receptor Tie-2, and several cytokines and chemokines. We measured 4 placental parameters (placental weight, syncytial knots, placental barrier thickness and mononuclear cells) and associated these with the levels of angiogenic factors and cytokines. In this study, MiP was not associated with severe outcomes. An increased ratio of peripheral Tie-2: Ang-1 was associated with the occurrence of MiP. Both Ang-1 and Ang-2 had similar magnitudes but inverse associations with placental barrier thickness. Malaria in pregnancy is an effect modifier of the association between Ang-1 and placental barrier thickness.","[Ataide, Ricardo; Murillo, Oscar; Dombrowski, Jamille G.; Souza, Rodrigo M.; Lima, Flavia A.; Marinho, Claudio R.

Nevertheless, significant studies on the pathophysiology of this form of infection are largely lacking. The few studies investigating oral route infection disregard that inoculation in the oral cavity (Oral infection, OI) or by gavage (Gastrointestinal infection, GI) represent different infection routes, yet both show clear-cut parasitemia and heart parasitism during the acute infection. Herein, BALB/c mice were subjected to acute OI or GI infection using 5x10(4) culture-derived Trypanosoma cruzi trypomastigotes. OI mice displayed higher parasitemia and mortality rates than their GI counterparts. Heart histopathology showed larger areas of infiltration in the GI mice, whereas liver lesions were more severe in the OI animals, accompanied by higher Alanine Transaminase and Aspartate Transaminase serum contents. A differential cytokine pattern was also observed because OI mice presented higher pro-inflammatory cytokine (IFN-gamma, TNF) serum levels than GI animals. Real-time PCR confirmed a higher TNF, IFN-gamma, as well as IL-10 expression in the cardiac tissue from the OI group compared with GI. Conversely, TGF-beta and IL-17 serum levels were greater in the GI animals. Immunolabeling revealed macrophages as the main tissue source of TNF in infected mice. The high mortality rate observed in the OI mice paralleled the TNF serum rise, with its inhibition by an anti-TNF treatment. Moreover, differences in susceptibility between GI versus OI mice were more clearly related to the host response than to the effect of gastric pH on parasites, since infection in magnesium hydroxide-treated mice showed similar results. Overall, the present study provides conclusive evidence that the initial site of parasite entrance critically affects host immune response and disease outcome. In light of the occurrence of oral Chagas disease outbreaks, our results raise important implications in terms of the current view of the natural disease course and host-parasite relationship.","[Barreto-de-Albuquerque, Juliana; Silva-dos-Santos, Danielle; Berbert, Luiz Ricardo; de Santana-van-Vliet, Eliane; Farias-de-Oliveira, Desio Aurelio; Cotta-de-Almeida, Vincius; Savino, Wilson] Fundacao Oswaldo Cruz, Inst Oswaldo Cruz, Lab Thymus Res, Rio De Janeiro, Brazil; [Perez, Ana Rosa; Roggero, Eduardo; Bottasso, Oscar] Natl Univ Rosario, Inst Immunol, Fac Med Sci, Rosario, Argentina; [Moreira, Otacilio C.] Fundacao Oswaldo Cruz, Inst Oswaldo Cruz, Lab Mol Biol & Endem Dis, Rio De Janeiro, Brazil; [de Carvalho-Pinto, Carla Eponina] Univ Fed Fluminense, Dept Immunobiol, Lab Expt Pathol, Niteroi, RJ, Brazil; [Jurberg, Jose] Fundacao Oswaldo Cruz, Inst Oswaldo Cruz, Natl & Int Lab Triatomine Taxon, Rio De Janeiro, Brazil","Barreto-de-Albuquerque, J (reprint author), Fundacao Oswaldo Cruz, Inst Oswaldo Cruz, Lab Thymus Res, Rio De Janeiro, Brazil.",jdemeis@ioc.fiocruz.br,"De Meis, Juliana/B-2211-2013; Cotta-de-Almeida, Vinicius/G-3939-2012","Perez, Ana Rosa/0000-0002-1636-7523",Rio de Janeiro State Research Foundation (FAPERJ) [E-26/103.249/2011]; Brazilian National Research Council (CNPq) [479431/2011-6],"This work was supported by the Rio de Janeiro State Research Foundation (FAPERJ-Grant E-26/103.249/2011) and Brazilian National Research Council (CNPq-Grant 479431/2011-6) to JdM.

We studied a cohort of 230 Cryptococcus neoformans (Cn) isolates from HIV-positive South African clinical trial patients with detailed clinical follow-up using multi-locus sequence typing and in vitro phenotypic virulence assays, correlating these data with clinical and fungal markers of disease in the patient. South African Cn displayed high levels of genetic diversity and locus variability compared to globally distributed types, and we identified 50 sequence types grouped within the main molecular types VNI, VNII and VNB, with 72% of isolates typed into one of seven 'high frequency' sequence types. Spatial analysis of patients' cryptococcal genotype was not shown to be clustered geographically, which might argue against recent local acquisition and in favour of reactivation of latent infection. Through comparison of MLST genotyping data with clinical parameters, we found a relationship between genetic lineage and clinical outcome, with patients infected with the VNB lineage having significantly worse survival (n=8, HR 3.35, CI 1.51-7.20, p=0.003), and this was maintained even after adjustment for known prognostic indicators and treatment regimen. Comparison of fungal genotype with in vitro phenotype (phagocytosis, laccase activity and CSF survival) performed on a subset of 89 isolates revealed evidence of lineage-associated virulence phenotype, with the VNII lineage displaying increased laccase activity (p=0.001) and ex vivo CSF survival (p=0.0001). These findings show that Cryptococcus neoformans is a phenotypically heterogeneous pathogen, and that lineage plays an important role in cryptococcal virulence during human infection. Furthermore, a detailed understanding of the genetic diversity in Southern Africa will support further investigation into how genetic diversity is structured across African environments, allowing assessment of the risks different ecotypes pose to infection.","[Beale, Mathew A.; Sabiiti, Wilber; Robertson, Emma J.; Fuentes-Cabrejo, Karen M.; Loyse, Angela; Harrison, Thomas S.; Bicanic, Tihana] St Georges Univ London, Inst Infect & Immun, London, England; [Beale, Mathew A.; O'Hanlon, Simon J.; Fisher, Matthew C.] Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Dept Infect Dis Epidemiol, Sch Publ Hlth, London, England; [Sabiiti, Wilber] Univ St Andrews, Sch Med, St Andrews, Fife, Scotland; [Jarvis, Joseph N.] Botswana UPenn Partnership, Gaborone, Botswana; [Jarvis, Joseph N.] Univ Penn, Perelman Sch Med, Div Infect Dis, Dept Med, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Jarvis, Joseph N.] London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, Fac Infect & Trop Dis, Dept Clin Res, London WC1, England; [Meintjes, Graeme] Univ Cape Town, Div Infect Dis & HIV Med, Dept Med, ZA-7925 Cape Town, South Africa; [Meintjes, Graeme] Univ Cape Town, Inst Infect Dis & Mol Med, ZA-7925 Cape Town, South Africa; [May, Robin C.] Univ Birmingham, Inst Microbiol & Infect, Birmingham, W Midlands, England; [May, Robin C.] Univ Birmingham, Sch Biosci, Birmingham, W Midlands, England; [May, Robin C.] Univ Hosp Birmingham Natl Hlth Serv NHS Fdn Trust, Queen Elizabeth Hosp Birmingham, Surg Reconstruct & Microbiol Res Ctr, Natl Inst Hlth Res, Birmingham, W Midlands, England","Beale, MA (reprint author), St Georges Univ London, Inst Infect & Immun, London, England.",matthew.fisher@imperial.ac.uk; tbicanic@sgul.ac.uk,,"May, Robin/0000-0001-5364-1838; Harrison, Thomas/0000-0003-3619-4348; Jarvis, Joseph/0000-0003-1459-5554; Meintjes, Graeme/0000-0003-1196-4414; Fisher, Matthew/0000-0002-1862-6402; Beale, Mathew/0000-0002-4740-3187; Bicanic, Tihana/0000-0002-2676-838X; O'Hanlon, Simon/0000-0002-6852-3911; , Wilber/0000-0002-4742-2791","Wellcome Trust (UK) [WT069991, WT098316, WT081794]; Medical Research Council (MRC UK) [K000373/1, G0601171, G1002327]; European Research Council under European Union's Seventh Framework Programme [614562]; Lister Institute for Preventative Medicine; Medical Research Council [G0501476, G0601171, MR/K000373/1]; Natural Environment Research Council [NE/K014455/1]","This work was supported by Wellcome Trust (UK) (www.wellcome.ac.uk) awards to TB (WT069991), GM (WT098316), and JNJ (WT081794); Medical Research Council (MRC UK) (www.mrc.ac.uk) awards to MCF (K000373/1), RCM (G0601171), TSH (G1002327); European Research Council under European Union's Seventh Framework Programme Grant (cordis.europa.eu/fp7/home_en.htm) to RCM (614562) and the Lister Institute for Preventative Medicine (www.lister-institute.org.uk) to RCM.

The majority of notified patients come from West African countries, such as Cote d'Ivoire, Ghana, Benin and Cameroon. All clinical isolates of M. ulcerans from these countries are closely related and their genomes differ only in a limited number of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Methodology/Principal Findings We performed a molecular epidemiological study with clinical isolates from patients from two distinct BU endemic regions of Cameroon, the Nyong and the Mape river basins. Whole genome sequencing of the M. ulcerans strains from these two BU endemic areas revealed the presence of two phylogenetically distinct clonal complexes. The strains from the Nyong river basin were genetically more diverse and less closely related to the M. ulcerans strain circulating in Ghana and Benin than the strains causing BU in the Mape river basin. Conclusions Our comparative genomic analysis revealed that M. ulcerans clones diversify locally by the accumulation of SNPs. Case isolates coming from more recently emerging BU endemic areas, such as the Mape river basin, may be less diverse than populations from longer standing disease foci, such as the Nyong river basin. Exchange of strains between distinct endemic areas seems to be rare and local clonal complexes can be easily distinguished by whole genome sequencing.","[Bolz, Miriam; Bratschi, Martin W.; Kerber, Sarah; Minyem, Jacques C.; Brites, Daniela; Pluschke, Gerd; Cabello, Araceli Lamelas] Swiss Trop & Publ Hlth Inst, Basel, Switzerland; [Bolz, Miriam; Bratschi, Martin W.; Kerber, Sarah; Brites, Daniela; Pluschke, Gerd; Cabello, Araceli Lamelas] Univ Basel, Basel, Switzerland; [Minyem, Jacques C.; Boock, Alphonse Um; Bayi, Pierre Franklin] FAIRMED, Yaounde, Cameroon; [Vogel, Moritz; Junghanss, Thomas] Univ Heidelberg Hosp, Sect Clin Trop Med, Heidelberg, Germany; [Harris, Simon R.; Parkhill, Julian] Wellcome Trust Sanger Inst, Cambridge, England","Bolz, M (reprint author), Swiss Trop & Publ Hlth Inst, Basel, Switzerland.",gerd.pluschke@unibas.ch,"Cabello, Araceli Lamelas/Q-6726-2018; Parkhill, Julian/G-4703-2011","Cabello, Araceli Lamelas/0000-0002-1939-5642; Parkhill, Julian/0000-0002-7069-5958",UBS Optimus Foundation,"Medicor Foundation, the Volkswagen Foundation and the Stop Buruli Consortium supported by the UBS Optimus Foundation funded elements of this study.

An increasing understanding of immunological events that account for the metacestode survival in human and murine AE infection prompted us to undertake explorative experiments tackling the potential of novel preventive and/or immunotherapeutic measures. In this study, the immunoprotective and immunotherapeutic ability of recombinant EmP29 antigen (rEmP29) was assessed in mice that were intraperitoneally infected with E. multilocularis metacestodes. For vaccination, three intraperitoneal injections with 20 mu g rEmP29 emulsified in saponin adjuvants were applied over 6 weeks. 2 weeks after the last boost, mice were infected, and at 90 days post-infection, rEmP29-vaccinated mice exhibited a median parasite weight that was reduced by 75% and 59% when compared to NaCl-or saponin-treated control mice, respectively. For immunotherapeutical application, the rEmP29 (20 mu g) vaccine was administered to experimentally infected mice, starting at 1 month post-infection, three times with 2 weeks intervals. Mice undergoing rEmP29 immunotherapy exhibited a median parasite load that was reduced by 53% and 49% when compared to NaCl- and saponin-treated control mice, respectively. Upon analysis of spleen cells, both, vaccination and treatment with rEmP29, resulted in low ratios of Th2/Th1 (IL-4/IFN-y) cytokine mRNA and low levels of mRNA coding for IL-10 and IL-2. These results suggest that reduction of the immunosuppressive environment takes place in vaccinated as well as immunotreated mice, and a shift towards a Th1 type of immune response may be responsible for the observed increased restriction of parasite growth. The present study provides the first evidence that active immunotherapy may present a sustainable route for the control of AE.","[Boubaker, Ghalia; Hemphill, Andrew; Huber, Cristina Olivia; Spiliotis, Markus; Gottstein, Bruno] Univ Bern, Inst Parasitol, Bern, Switzerland; [Boubaker, Ghalia] Univ Bern, Grad Sch Cellular & Biomed Sci, Bern, Switzerland; [Boubaker, Ghalia; Babba, Hamouda] Univ Monastir, Dept Biol Clin B, Lab Med & Mol Parasitol Mycol LR12ES08, Fac Pharm, Monastir, Tunisia","Boubaker, G (reprint author), Univ Bern, Inst Parasitol, Bern, Switzerland.",bruno.gottstein@vetsuisse.unibe.ch,,,Swiss National Science Foundation [31003A_141039/1]; UNESCO-L'OREAL international "For women in science'' Fellowship; Novartis Research Foundation,"This work was supported by the Swiss National Science Foundation (grant no. 31003A_141039/1), the UNESCO-L'OREAL international ""For women in science'' Fellowships (http://www.unesco.org/) and a grant by the Novartis Research Foundation.

Infected individuals have an altered immune response with evidence that antibody response to vaccination is impaired. Hence, treatment of helminth infections before vaccination may be a simple intervention to improve vaccine immunogenicity. In the present study we investigated whether a single-dose antihelminthic treatment influences antibody responses to a seasonal influenza vaccine in primary school children living in Gabon, Central Africa. Methods In this placebo-controlled double-blind trial conducted in Gabon the effect of a single-dose antihelminthic treatment with 400 mg albendazole versus a placebo one month prior to immunization with a seasonal influenza vaccine was investigated. Antiviral antibody titers against all three vaccine strains were assessed by haemagglutination inhibition (HI) test at baseline (Day 0; vaccination) and four weeks (Day 28) as well as 12 weeks (Day 84) following vaccination. Vaccine-specific memory B-cell response was measured at Day 0 and Day 84 by vaccine-specific Enzyme-linked Immunospot (ELISpot) assay. The trial is registered with the Pan African Clinical Trials Registry (PACTR) (PACTR201303000434188). Results 98 school children aged 6-10 years were randomly allocated to receive either antihelminthic treatment or placebo and were vaccinated one month after the treatment. The prevalence of helminths at baseline was 21%. Vaccine-specific HI titers against at least one of the three vaccine strains increased at Day 28 and Day 84 in all participants. HI titers against both influenza A strains as well as memory B-cell response were modestly higher in the antihelminthic treated group compared to the placebo group but the difference was not statistically significant. Total but not specific IgA was elevated in the antihelminthic treated group compared to the control group at Day 28. Conclusion In our setting antihelminthic treatment had no significant effect on influenza vaccine immunogenicity. A trend towards better antiviral and vaccine immunogenicity in the antihelminthic treated group encourages studies to be conducted with alternative treatment schedules or in populations with a higher helminth burden.","[Brueckner, Sina; Agnandji, Selidji T.; Engleitner, Thomas; Lell, Bertrand; Mordmueller, Benjamin; Adegnika, Ayola A.; Kremsner, Peter G.; Esen, Meral] Univ Tubingen, Inst Trop Med, Tubingen, Germany; [Brueckner, Sina; Agnandji, Selidji T.; Berberich, Stefan; Bache, Emmanuel; Fernandes, Jose F.; Loembe, Marguerite Massinga; Lell, Bertrand; Mordmueller, Benjamin; Adegnika, Ayola A.; Kremsner, Peter G.; Esen, Meral] Albert Schweitzer Hosp, Ctr Rech Med Lambarene, Lambarene, Gabon; [Schweiger, Brunhilde] Robert Koch Inst, Natl Referenzzentrum Influenza, Berlin, Germany; [Adegnika, Ayola A.; Yazdanbakhsh, Maria] Leiden Med Univ Ctr, Dept Parasitol, Leiden, Netherlands","Bruckner, S (reprint author), Univ Tubingen, Inst Trop Med, Tubingen, Germany.",meral.esen@uni-tuebingen.de,"Mordmuller, Benjamin/A-5749-2010","Mordmuller, Benjamin/0000-0001-9101-2768; Massinga Loembe, Marguerite/0000-0002-7822-566X; Yazdanbakhsh, Maria/0000-0002-7666-1441",Bundesministerium fur Bildung und Forschung (BMBF) [01 KA 1009],"The study was funded by the Bundesministerium fur Bildung und Forschung (BMBF).

In an endemic area of Taiwan, B. pseudomallei is primarily geographically distributed in cropped fields in the northwest of this area, whereas melioidosis cases are distributed in a densely populated district in the southeast. We hypothesized that contaminated cropped fields generated aerosols contaminated with B. pseudomallei, which were carried by a northwesterly wind to the densely populated southeastern district. We collected soil and aerosol samples from a 72 km(2) area of land, including the melioidosis-clustered area and its surroundings. Aerosols that contained B. pseudomallei-specific TTSS (type III secretion system) ORF2 DNA were well distributed in the endemic area but were rare in the surrounding areas during the rainy season. The concentration of this specific DNA in aerosols was positively correlated with the incidence of melioidosis and the appearance of a northwesterly wind. Moreover, the isolation rate in the superficial layers of the contaminated cropped field in the northwest was correlated with PCR positivity for aerosols collected from the southeast over a 2-year period. According to pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and multilocus sequence typing (MLST) analyses, PFGE Type Ia (ST58) was the predominant pattern linking the molecular association among soil, aerosol and human isolates. Thus, the airborne transmission of melioidosis moves from the contaminated soil to aerosols and/or to humans in this endemic area.","[Chen, Pei-Shih] Kaohsiung Med Univ, Dept Publ Hlth, Kaohsiung, Taiwan; [Chen, Yao-Shen] Kaohsiung Vet Gen Hosp, Dept Internal Med, Kaohsiung, Taiwan; [Lin, Hsi-Hsun] E Da Hosp, Dept Med, Kaohsiung, Taiwan; [Liu, Pei-Ju; Ni, Wei-Fan; Liang, Shih-Hsiung; Chen, Ya-Lei] Natl Kaohsiung Normal Univ, Dept Biotechnol, Kaohsiung, Taiwan; [Hsueh, Pei-Tan] Natl Sun Yat Sen Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Kaohsiung 80424, Taiwan; [Chen, Chialin] Ctr Dis Control ROC, Ctr Res Diagnost & Vaccine Dev, Taipei, Taiwan","Chen, PS (reprint author), Kaohsiung Med Univ, Dept Publ Hlth, Kaohsiung, Taiwan.",dan1001@ms31.hinet.net,,,"Taiwan Center for Disease Control [MOHW103-CDC-114-13320]; Taiwan Ministry of Technology and Science [MOST103-CDC-C-114-133203, NSC192-2628-B107-MY3, MOST103-2320-B-037-018, NSC102-2628-B-075B-MY3, MOST103-2320B-075B002, MOST103-2320-B-214008]","This study was funded by YLC's grants supported by the Taiwan Center for Disease Control (MOHW103-CDC-114-13320; Association of geographical conditions, climate changes, contagious origins and disease transmission in high risk area for melioidosis incidence; URL: http://www.cdc.gov.tw/professional/index.aspx), and partially supported by the Taiwan Ministry of Technology and Science (MOST103-CDC-C-114-133203; Regulatory mechanism of ligand-receptor of somatic antigens in Burkholderia pseudomallei; and NSC192-2628-B107-MY3, Intracellular Burkholderia pseudomallei as Trojan horse induces melioidosis meningitis; URL: http://www.most.gov.tw).

Although the results have been highly favorable, administration of STR requires intramuscular injection and carries the risk of side effects, such as hearing loss. Therefore, an all-oral, potentially less toxic, treatment regimen has been sought and encouraged by the World Health Organization. A combination of RIF plus clarithromycin (CLR) has been successful in patients first administered RIF+STR for 2 or 4 weeks. Based on evidence of efficacy of clofazimine (CFZ) in humans and mice with tuberculosis, we hypothesized that the combination of RIF+CFZ would be effective against M. ulcerans in the mouse footpad model of M. ulcerans disease because CFZ has similar MIC against M. tuberculosis and M. ulcerans. For comparison, mice were also treated with the gold standard of RIF+STR, the proposed RIF+CLR alternative regimen, or CFZ alone. Treatment was initiated after development of footpad swelling, when the bacterial burden was 4.64 +/- 0.14log(10) CFU. At week 2 of treatment, the CFU counts had increased in untreated mice, remained essentially unchanged in mice treated with CFZ alone, decreased modestly with either RIF+CLR or RIF+CFZ, and decreased substantially with RIF+STR. At week 4, on the basis of footpad CFU counts, the combination regimens were ranked as follows: RIF +STR>RIF+CLR>RIF+CFZ. At weeks 6 and 8, none of the mice treated with these regimens had detectable CFU. Footpad swelling declined comparably with all of the combination regimens, as did the levels of detectable mycolactone A/B. In mice treated for only 6 weeks and followed up for 24 weeks, there were no relapses in RIF+STR treated mice, one (5%) relapse in RIF+CFZ-treated mice, but >50% in RIF+CLR treated mice. On the basis of these results, RIF+CFZ has potential as a continuation phase regimen for treatment of M. ulcerans disease.","[Converse, Paul J.; Tyagi, Sandeep; Li, Si-Yang; Nuermberger, Eric L.; Grosset, Jacques H.] Johns Hopkins Univ, Ctr TB Res, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA; [Xing, Yalan; Kishi, Yoshito] Harvard Univ, Dept Chem & Chem Biol, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Adamson, John] Univ KwaZulu Natal, KwaZulu Natal Res Inst TB & HIV, Nelson R Mandela Sch Med, Durban, South Africa","Converse, PJ (reprint author), Johns Hopkins Univ, Ctr TB Res, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA.",pconver1@jhmi.edu,,,NIH-NIAID [R01-AI.082612]; Eisai USA Foundation; KwaZulu-Natal Research Institute for Tuberculosis,"The authors are grateful for the funding of this work that was provided by NIH-NIAID (http://www.niaid.nih.gov) R01-AI.082612.

Polymorphisms in the TOLLIP gene are associated with infectious diseases. Material and Methods The polymorphisms rs5743899 and rs3750920 in the TOLLIP gene were genotyped by polymerase chain reaction and restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis in 631 patients with cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) caused by L. guyanensis and 530 individuals with no history of leishmaniasis. Results The G and T alleles of the rs5743899 and rs3750920 were more common in patients with CL than in healthy individuals (P = 2.6x10(-8); odds ratio [OR], 1.7 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.4-2.0] and P = 1.9x10(-8); OR, 1.6 [95% CI 1.4-1.9] respectively). The r(2) and D'linkage disequilibrium between the two polymorphisms are 0.05 and 0.473 with a confidence bounds of 0.37 to 0.57 respectively.","[de Araujo, Felipe Jules; Oliveira da Silva, Luan Diego; Vital, Wonei de Seixas; Talhari, Sinesio; Ramasawmy, Rajendranath] Univ Nilton Lins, Fac Med, Manaus, Amazonas, Brazil; [Mesquita, Tirza Gabrielle; Pinheiro, Suzana Kanawati; Chrusciak-Talhari, Anette; de Oliveira Guerra, Jorge Augusto; Ramasawmy, Rajendranath] Fundacao Med Trop Dr Heitor Vieira Dourado, Manaus, Amazonas, Brazil","de Araujo, FJ (reprint author), Univ Nilton Lins, Fac Med, Manaus, Amazonas, Brazil.",ramasawm@gmail.com,"Ramasawmy, Rajendranath/V-4926-2019",,Brazilian Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq) [Processo: 404181/2012-0],"The Brazilian Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq) awarded a grant to Dr. R.

Many high-risk disease transmission interfaces have not been monitored for zoonotic pathogens due to difficulties inherent to invasive sampling of free-ranging wildlife. Non-invasive surveillance of nonhuman primates for pathogens with high potential for spillover into humans is therefore critical for understanding disease ecology of existing zoonotic pathogen burdens and identifying communities where zoonotic diseases are likely to emerge in the future. We developed a non-invasive oral sampling technique using ropes distributed to nonhuman primates to target viruses shed in the oral cavity, which through bite wounds and discarded food, could be transmitted to people. Optimization was performed by testing paired rope and oral swabs from laboratory colony rhesus macaques for rhesus cytomegalovirus (RhCMV) and simian foamy virus (SFV) and implementing the technique with free-ranging terrestrial and arboreal nonhuman primate species in Uganda and Nepal. Both ubiquitous DNA and RNA viruses, RhCMV and SFV, were detected in oral samples collected from ropes distributed to laboratory colony macaques and SFV was detected in free-ranging macaques and olive baboons. Our study describes a technique that can be used for disease surveillance in free-ranging nonhuman primates and, potentially, other wildlife species when invasive sampling techniques may not be feasible.","[Evans, Tierra Smiley; Gilardi, Kirsten V.; Goldstein, Tracey; Cranfield, Michael R.; Wolking, David; Smith, Brett; Mazet, Jonna A.

Our research is focused on Schistosoma mansoni prolyl oligopeptidase (SmPOP) from the serine peptidase family S9, which has not been investigated in detail in trematodes. Methodology/Principal Findings We demonstrate that SmPOP is expressed in adult worms and schistosomula in an enzymatically active form. By immunofluorescence microscopy, SmPOP is localized in the tegument and parenchyma of both developmental stages. Recombinant SmPOP was produced in Escherichia coli and its active site specificity investigated using synthetic substrate and inhibitor libraries, and by homology modeling. SmPOP is a true oligopeptidase that hydrolyzes peptide (but not protein) substrates with a strict specificity for Pro at P1. The inhibition profile is analogous to those for mammalian POPs. Both the recombinant enzyme and live worms cleave host vasoregulatory, proline-containing hormones such as angiotensin I and bradykinin. Finally, we designed nanomolar inhibitors of SmPOP that induce deleterious phenotypes in cultured schistosomes. Conclusions/Significance We provide the first localization and functional analysis of SmPOP together with chemical tools for measuring its activity. We briefly discuss the notion that SmPOP, operating at the host-parasite interface to cleave host bioactive peptides, may contribute to the survival of the parasite. If substantiated, SmPOP could be a new target for the development of anti-schistosomal drugs.","[Fajtova, Pavla; Hradilek, Martin; Vondrasek, Jiri; Jilkova, Adela; Ulrychova, Lenka; Mares, Michael; Horn, Martin] Acad Sci Czech Republic, Inst Organ Chem & Biochem, Prague, Czech Republic; [Fajtova, Pavla] Charles Univ Prague, Fac Med 1, Prague, Czech Republic; [Stefanic, Sasa] Univ Zurich, Inst Parasitol, CH-8057 Zurich, Switzerland; [Dvorak, Jan] Acad Sci Czech Republic, Inst Mol Genet, Prague, Czech Republic; [Dvorak, Jan] Acad Sci Czech Republic, Inst Parasitol, Ctr Biol, CR-37005 Ceske Budejovice, Czech Republic; [Ulrychova, Lenka] Charles Univ Prague, Fac Sci, Prague, Czech Republic; [McKerrow, James H.; Caffrey, Conor R.] Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Pathol, Ctr Innovat & Discovery Parasit Dis, San Francisco, CA 94140 USA","Horn, M (reprint author), Acad Sci Czech Republic, Inst Organ Chem & Biochem, Prague, Czech Republic.",horn@uochb.cas.cz,"Mares, Michael/B-2413-2009; Vondrasek, JIri/A-4244-2008; Horn, Martin/A-8701-2008; Ulrychova, Lenka/G-6346-2014; Jilkova, Adela/G-5809-2014","Mares, Michael/0000-0002-0847-5022; Horn, Martin/0000-0001-9110-2018; Ulrychova, Lenka/0000-0002-3835-9305; Jilkova, Adela/0000-0002-3158-9626; Stefanic, Sasa/0000-0001-7367-1831","Czech Science Foundation [P302/11/1481]; Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports of the Czech Republic [LO1302]; institutional project [RVO 61388963]; Sciex-NMS from CRUS Switzerland [11.222]","This work was supported by the grant P302/11/1481 from Czech Science Foundation (www.gacr.cz), the project InterBioMed LO1302 from the Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports of the Czech Republic and by the institutional project RVO 61388963 (www.msmt.cz).

The Philippines is endemic for dengue fever, but massive employment of insecticides favored the development of resistance mutations in its major vector, Aedes aegypti. Alternative vector control strategies consist in releasing artificially modified mosquitos in the wild, but knowledge on their dispersal ability is necessary for a successful implementation. Despite being documented that Ae.aegypti can be passively transported for long distances, no study to date has been aimed at understanding whether human marine transportation can substantially shape the migration patterns of this mosquito. With thousands of islands connected by a dense network of ships, the Philippines is an ideal environment to fill this knowledge gap. Methodology/principal findings Larvae of Ae.aegypti from 15 seaports in seven major islands of central-western Philippines were collected and genotyped at seven microsatellite loci. Low genetic structure and considerable gene flow was found in the area. Univariate and multivariate regression analyses suggested that anthropic factors (specifically the amount of processed cargo and human population density) can explain the observed population structure, while geographical distance was not correlated. Interestingly, cargo shipments seem to be more efficient than passenger ships in transporting Ae. aegypti. Bayesian clustering confirmed that Ae. aegypti from busy ports are more genetically similar, while populations from idle ports are relatively structured, regardless of the geographical distance that separates them. Conclusions/significance The results confirmed the pivotal role of marine human-mediated long-range dispersal in determining the population structure of Ae. aegypti. Hopefully corroborated by further research, the present findings could assist the design of more effective vector control strategies.","[Fonzi, Eugenio; Higa, Yukiko; Futami, Kyoko; Minakawa, Noboru] Nagasaki Univ, Inst Trop Med, Dept Vector Ecol & Environm, Nagasaki 852, Japan; [Bertuso, Arlene G.] Univ Philippines, Dept Publ Hlth, Manila, Philippines","Fonzi, E (reprint author), Nagasaki Univ, Inst Trop Med, Dept Vector Ecol & Environm, Nagasaki 852, Japan.",felicita.caldotricheco@gmail.com,,,"Japan Initiative for Global Research Network on Infectious Diseases (JGRID); Japanese Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT); Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) KAKENHI [23406008]","This work was partially supported by funds granted to NM by the Program of Japan Initiative for Global Research Network on Infectious Diseases (JGRID, http://www.crnid.riken.jp/jgrid/en), the Japanese Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT, http://www.mext.go.jp/english) and Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS, https://www.jsps.go.jp/english) KAKENHI.

It is an emerging orthopox-virus zoonosis in the tropical rain forest of Africa and is endemic in the Congo-basin and sporadic in West Africa; it remains a tropical neglected disease of persons in impoverished rural areas. Interaction of the human population with wildlife increases human infection with MPX virus (MPXV), and infection from human to human is possible. Smallpox vaccination provides good cross-protection against MPX; however, the vaccination campaign ended in Africa in 1980, meaning that a large proportion of the population is currently unprotected against MPXV infection. Disease control hinges on deterring zoonotic exposure to the virus and, barring that, interrupting person-to-person spread. However, there are no FDA-approved therapies against MPX, and current vaccines are limited due to safety concerns. For this reason, new studies on pathogenesis, prophylaxis and therapeutics are still of great interest, not only for the scientific community but also for the governments concerned that MPXV could be used as a bioterror agent. In the present study, a new vaccination strategy approach based on three recombinant bovine herpesvirus 4 (BoHV-4) vectors, each expressing different MPXV glycoproteins, A29L, M1R and B6R were investigated in terms of protection from a lethal MPXV challenge in STAT1 knockout mice. BoHV-4-A-CMV-A29LgD(106)Delta TK, BoHV-4A-EF1 alpha-M1RgD(106)Delta TK and BoHV-4-A-EF1 alpha-B6RgD(106)Delta TK were successfully constructed by recombineering, and their capacity to express their transgene was demonstrated. A small challenge study was performed, and all three recombinant BoHV-4 appeared safe (no weight-loss or obvious adverse events) following intraperitoneal administration. Further, BoHV-4-AEF1 alpha-M1RgD(106)Delta TK alone or in combination with BoHV-4-A-CMV-A29LgD(106)Delta TK and BoHV-4-A-EF1 alpha-B6RgD(106)Delta TK, was shown to be able to protect, 100% alone and 80% in combination, STAT1((-/-)) mice against mortality and morbidity. This work demonstrated the efficacy of BoHV-4 based vectors and the use of BoHV-4 as a vaccine-vector platform.","[Franceschi, Valentina; Jacca, Sarah; Pompilio, Daniela; Tebaldi, Giulia; Donofrio, Gaetano] Univ Parma, Dept Med Vet Sci, I-43100 Parma, Italy; [Parker, Scott; Crump, Ryan W.; Doronin, Konstantin; Hembrador, Edguardo; Buller, Mark R.] St Louis Univ, Sch Med, Mol Microbiol & Immunol, St Louis, MO USA; [Estep, Ryan D.; Wong, Scott W.] Oregon Hlth & Sci Univ, Vaccine & Gene Therapy Inst, Beaverton, OR USA","Franceschi, V (reprint author), Univ Parma, Dept Med Vet Sci, I-43100 Parma, Italy.",gaetano.donofrio@unipr.it,,"Donofrio, Gaetano/0000-0002-8984-0377; franceschi, valentina/0000-0003-3945-2285",Italian Minister of Scientific Research [2010LLXR94 004]; National Institutes of Health [HHSN272201000021I],"The work was supported by Italian Minister of Scientific Research (PRIN 2010-2011; 2010LLXR94 004) and by National Institutes of Health under Task order A59 of contract HHSN272201000021I.

Early case detection followed by adequate treatment is essential to the control of VL. However, the available diagnostic tests are either invasive and require considerable expertise (parasitological demonstration of the parasite in tissue smears) or unable to distinguish between past and active infection (serological methods). Therefore, we aimed to develop a lateral flow assay in the form of an immunochromatographic test (ICT) device based on the detection of a circulating Leishmania antigen using monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). Methodology/Principal Findings mAbs were produced by fusion of murine myeloma cells with splenocytes isolated from a mouse immunized with L. donovani soluble crude antigen. Out of 12 cloned hybridoma cell lines, two secreted mAbs recognizing the same leishmanial protein. These mAbs were used to produce an ICT as a sandwich assay for the detection of circulating antigen in serum and blood samples. The ICT was evaluated with 213 serum samples from VL patients living in VL endemic areas in China, and with 156 serum samples from patients with other diseases as well as 78 serum samples from healthy donors. Sensitivity, specificity and diagnostic efficiency of the new ICT was 95.8%, 98.7% and 97.3%, respectively. Compared with a commercially available antibody detecting ICT, our antigen-based ICT performed slightly better. Conclusion/Significance The newly developed ICT is an easy to use and more accurate diagnostic tool which fulfils the performance and operational characteristics required for VL case detection under field and laboratory conditions. As our ICT detects a circulating antigen, it will also be useful in monitoring treatment success and diagnosing VL in immunocompromised patients.","[Gao, Chun-hua; Yang, Yue-tao; Shi, Feng; Wang, Jun-yun] WHO Collaborating Ctr Malaria Schistosomiasis & F, Natl Ctr Int Res Trop Dis, Chinese Ctr Dis Control & Prevent, Natl Inst Parasit Dis,Lab Parasite & Vector,Minis, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Steverding, Dietmar; Wang, Xia] Univ E Anglia, Norwich Med Sch, BioMed Res Ctr, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England","Gao, CH (reprint author), WHO Collaborating Ctr Malaria Schistosomiasis & F, Natl Ctr Int Res Trop Dis, Chinese Ctr Dis Control & Prevent, Natl Inst Parasit Dis,Lab Parasite & Vector,Minis, Shanghai, Peoples R China.",wang_junyun@yahoo.com; dsteverding@hotmail.com,,"Steverding, Dietmar/0000-0002-0050-7771","National S & T Major Program [2008ZX10004-011, 2012-ZX10004-201, 2012-ZX10004-220]","This work was funded by National S & T Major Program (http://www.nmp.gov.cn), grant No.: 2008ZX10004-011, 2012-ZX10004-201 and 2012-ZX10004-220.

MSH2 is an early acting, central component of the Mismatch Repair (MMR) pathway, which is responsible for the recognition and correction of base mismatches that occur during DNA replication and recombination. In addition, recent evidence suggests that MSH2 might also play an important, but poorly understood, role in responding to oxidative damage in both African and American trypanosomes. Methodology/Principal Findings To investigate the involvement of MMR in the oxidative stress response, null mutants of MSH2 were generated in Trypanosoma brucei procyclic forms and in Trypanosoma cruzi epimastigote forms. Unexpectedly, the MSH2 null mutants showed increased resistance to H2O2 exposure when compared with wild type cells, a phenotype distinct from the previously observed increased sensitivity of T. brucei bloodstream forms MSH2 mutants. Complementation studies indicated that the increased oxidative resistance of procyclic T. brucei was due to adaptation to MSH2 loss. In both parasites, loss of MSH2 was shown to result in increased tolerance to alkylation by MNNG and increased accumulation of 8-oxo-guanine in the nuclear and mitochondrial genomes, indicating impaired MMR. In T. cruzi, loss of MSH2 also increases the parasite capacity to survive within host macrophages. Conclusions/Significance Taken together, these results indicate MSH2 displays conserved, dual roles in MMR and in the response to oxidative stress. Loss of the latter function results in life cycle dependent differences in phenotypic outcomes in T. brucei MSH2 mutants, most likely because of the greater burden of oxidative stress in the insect stage of the parasite.","[Grazielle-Silva, Viviane; Campos, Priscila C.; Miranda, Julia B.; Alves, Ceres L.; Machado, Carlos R.; Teixeira, Santuza M.

Recent studies in Chile indicate that passive transfer of convalescent human plasma shows promise as a possible treatment for HPS. Unfortunately availability of convalescent plasma from survivors of this lethal disease is very limited. We are interested in exploring the concept of using DNA vaccine technology to produce antiviral biologics including polyclonal neutralizing antibodies for use in humans. Geese produce IgY and an alternatively spliced form IgY Delta Fc that can be purified at high concentrations from egg yolks. IgY lacks the properties of mammalian Fc that make antibodies produced in horses sheep and rabbits reactogenic in humans. Geese were vaccinated with an ANDV DNA vaccine encoding the virus envelope glycoproteins. All geese developed high-titer neutralizing antibodies after the second vaccination and maintained high-levels of neutralizing antibodies as measured by a pseudovirion neutralization assay (PsVNA) for over 1 year. A booster vaccination resulted in extraordinarily high levels of neutralizing antibodies (i.e. PsVNA(80) titers > 100,000). Analysis of IgY and IgY Delta Fc by epitope mapping show these antibodies to be highly reactive to specific amino acid sequences of ANDV envelope glycoproteins. We examined the protective efficacy of the goose-derived antibody in the hamster model of lethal HPS. alpha-ANDV immune sera or IgY/IgY Delta Fc purified from eggs were passively transferred to hamsters subcutaneously starting 5 days after an IM challenge with ANDV (25 LD50). Both immune sera and egg-derived purified IgY/IgY Delta Fc protected 8 of 8 and 7 of 8 hamsters respectively. In contrast all hamsters receiving IgY/IgY Delta Fc purified from normal geese (n=8) or no-treatment (n=8) developed lethal HPS. These findings demonstrate that the DNA vaccine/goose platform can be used to produce a candidate antiviral biological product capable of preventing a lethal disease when administered post-exposure.","[Haese, Nicole; Henderson, Thomas; Nilles, Matthew L.; Bradley, David S.] Univ N Dakota, Sch Med & Hlth Sci, Dept Basic Sci, Grand Forks, ND 58201 USA; [Brocato, Rebecca L.; Kwilas, Steve A.; Josleyn, Matthew D.; Hammerbeck, Christopher D.; Hooper, Jay W.] US States Army Med Res Inst Infect Dis, Div Virol, Ft Detrick, MD USA; [Schiltz, James] Avianax LLC, Grand Forks, ND USA; [Royals, Michael] Cedar Ind, Pierce, CO USA; [Ballantyne, John] Aldevron, Fargo, ND USA","Haese, N (reprint author), Univ N Dakota, Sch Med & Hlth Sci, Dept Basic Sci, Grand Forks, ND 58201 USA.",Jay.W.Hooper.civ@mail.mil,"Brocato, Rebecca/M-6400-2019; Hooper, Jay/K-2362-2017; Brocato, Rebecca/H-1236-2019","Brocato, Rebecca/0000-0003-4377-0710; Hooper, Jay/0000-0002-4475-0415; Brocato, Rebecca/0000-0003-4377-0710; Nilles, Matthew/0000-0002-2235-8682",Military Infectious Disease Research Program; Program Area T; Army Small Business Technology Transfer Program [W81XWH-13-C-0041],"This research was supported by funding from the Military Infectious Disease Research Program, Program Area T, and by the Army Small Business Technology Transfer Program, project number W81XWH-13-C-0041.

The virus causes the development of the disease Japanese encephalitis (JE) in a small proportion of those infected, predominantly affecting children in eastern and southern Asia. Annual JE incidence estimates range from 50,000-175,000, with 25%-30% of cases resulting in mortality. It is estimated that 3 billion people live in countries in which JEV is endemic. The virus exists in an enzootic transmission cycle, with mosquitoes transmitting JEV between birds as reservoir hosts and pigs as amplifying hosts. Zoonotic infection occurs as a result of spillover events from the main transmission cycle. The reservoir avian hosts include cattle egrets, pond herons, and other species of water birds belonging to the family Ardeidae. Irrigated rice fields provide an ideal breeding ground for mosquitoes and attract migratory birds, maintaining the transmission of JEV. Although multiple vaccines have been developed for JEV, they are expensive and require multiple doses to maintain efficacy and immunity. As humans are a ""dead-end"" host for the virus, vaccination of the human population is unlikely to result in eradication. Therefore, vector control of the principal mosquito vector, Culex tritaeniorhynchus, represents a more promising strategy for reducing transmission. Current vector control strategies include intermittent irrigation of rice fields and space spraying of insecticides during outbreaks. However, Cx. Tritaeniorhynchus is subject to heavy exposure to pesticides in rice fields, and as a result, insecticide resistance has developed. In recent years, significant advancements have been made in the potential use of the bacterial endosymbiont Wolbachia for mosquito biocontrol. The successful transinfection of Wolbachia strains from Drosophila flies to Aedes (Stegomyia) mosquitoes has resulted in the generation of ""dengue-refractory"" mosquito lines. The successful establishment of Wolbachia in wild Aedes aegypti populations has recently been demonstrated, and open releases in dengue-endemic countries are ongoing. This review outlines the current control methods for JEV in addition to highlighting the potential use of Wolbachia-based biocontrol strategies to impact transmission. JEV and dengue virus are both members of the Flavivirus genus, and the successful establishment of Drosophila Wolbachia strains in Cx. Tritaeniorhynchus, as the principal vector of JEV, is predicted to significantly impact JEV transmission.","[Jeffries, Claire L.; Walker, Thomas] London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, Dept Dis Control, London WC1, England","Jeffries, CL (reprint author), London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, Dept Dis Control, London WC1, England.",thomas.walker@lshtm.ac.uk,"Jeffries, Claire/E-4509-2011; Walker, Thomas/B-9198-2014","Jeffries, Claire/0000-0002-0298-2808; Walker, Thomas/0000-0002-3545-012X",Wellcome Trust/Royal Society [101285/Z/13/Z],"TW received a Wellcome Trust/Royal Society grant (101285/Z/13/Z): http://www.wellcome. ac.uk; https://royalsociety.org.

The disease progresses from an early (hemo-lymphatic) stage to the late (meningoencephalitic) stage characterized by presence of parasites in the central nervous system. We hypothesized that disease progression and severity of the neurological response is modulated by cytokines. Methods A total of 55 sleeping sickness cases and 41 healthy controls were recruited passively at Lwala hospital, in Northern Uganda. A panel of six cytokines (IFN-gamma, IL1-beta, TNF-alpha, IL-6, TGF-beta and IL-10) were assayed from paired plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples. Cytokine concentrations were analyzed in relation to disease progression, clinical presentation and severity of neurological responses. Results Median plasma levels (pg/ml) of IFN-gamma (46.3), IL-6 (61.7), TGF-beta (8755) and IL-10 (256.6) were significantly higher in cases compared to controls (p< 0.0001). When early stage and late stage CSF cytokines were compared, IL-10 and IL-6 were up regulated in late stage patients and were associated with a reduction in tremors and cranioneuropathy. IL-10 had a higher staging accuracy with a sensitivity of 85.7%(95% CI, 63.7%-97%) and a specificity of 100% (95% CI, 39.8%-100%) while for IL-6, a specificity of 100% (95% CI, 47.8%-100%) gave a sensitivity of 83.3% (95% CI, 62.2%-95.3%). Conclusion Our study demonstrates the role of host inflammatory cytokines in modulating the progression and severity of neurological responses in sleeping sickness. We demonstrate here an up-regulation of IL-6 and IL-10 during the late stage with a potential as adjunct stage bio-markers. Given that both cytokines could potentially be elevated by other CNS infections, our findings should be further validated in a large cohort of patients including those with other inflammatory diseases such as cerebral malaria.","[Kato, Charles D.; Nanteza, Ann; Mugasa, Claire M.; Matovu, Enock] Makerere Univ, Sch Biosecur Biotech & Lab Sci, Coll Vet Med Anim Resources & Biosecur, Kampala, Uganda; [Alibu, Vincent P.] Makerere Univ, Coll Nat Sci, Kampala, Uganda","Kato, CD (reprint author), Makerere Univ, Sch Biosecur Biotech & Lab Sci, Coll Vet Med Anim Resources & Biosecur, Kampala, Uganda.",matovue@covab.mak.ac.ug,,"Matovu, Enock/0000-0003-0714-7032",Wellcome Trust [087535/Z/08/A],"This study was conducted within the framework of the consortium Afrique One ""Ecosystem and Population Health: Expanding Frontiers in Health"".

Establishment of highly sensitive and specific laboratory diagnosis is essential to reveal the magnitude of problem and to improve treatment. This study aimed to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of a recombinant LigA protein based IgM ELISA during outbreaks in the clinical-setting of a highly endemic country. Methodology/Principal Findings A prospective study was conducted from October 2011 to September 2013 at a national referral hospital for infectious diseases in Manila, Philippines. Patients who were hospitalized with clinically suspected leptospirosis were enrolled. Plasma and urine were collected on admission and/or at discharge and tested using the LigA-IgM ELISA and a whole cell-based IgM ELISA. Sensitivity and specificity of these tests were evaluated with cases diagnosed by microscopic agglutination test (MAT), culture and LAMP as the composite reference standard and blood bank donors as healthy controls: the mean+3 standard deviation optical density value of healthy controls was used as the cut-off limit (0.062 for the LigA-IgM ELISA and 0.691 for the whole cell-based IgM ELISA). Of 304 patients enrolled in the study, 270 (89.1%) were male and the median age was 30.5 years; 167 (54.9%) were laboratory confirmed. The sensitivity and ROC curve AUC for the LigA-IgM ELISA was significantly greater than the whole cell-based IgM ELISA (69.5% vs. 54.3%, p<0.01; 0.90 vs. 0.82, p<0.01) on admission, but not at discharge. The specificity of LigA-IgM ELISA and whole cell-based IgM ELISA were not significantly different (98% vs. 97%). Among 158 MAT negative patients, 53 and 28 were positive by LigA- and whole cell-based IgM ELISA, respectively; if the laboratory confirmation was re-defined by LigA-IgM ELISA and LAMP, the clinical findings were more characteristic of leptospirosis than the diagnosis based on MAT/culture/LAMP. Conclusions/Significance The newly developed LigA-IgM ELISA is more sensitive than the whole cell-based IgM based ELISA. Although the final diagnosis must be validated by more specific tests, LigA-IgM ELISA could be a useful diagnostic test in a real clinical-setting, where diagnosis is needed in the early phase of infection.","[Kitashoji, Emi; Usuda, Daisuke; Suzuki, Motoi; Ariyoshi, Koya] Nagasaki Univ, Inst Trop Med, Dept Clin Trop Med, Grad Sch Biomed Sci, Nagasaki 852, Japan; [Koizumi, Nobuo; Ohnishi, Makoto] Natl Inst Infect Dis, Dept Bacteriol, Shinjuku Ku, Tokyo 1628640, Japan; [Lacuesta, Talitha Lea V.; Ribo, Maricel R.; Tria, Edith S.; Go, Winston S.; Dimaano, Efren M.; Villarama, Jose B.] San Lazaro Hosp, Manila, Philippines; [Usuda, Daisuke] Kanazawa Med Univ, Himi Municipal Hosp, Dept Community Med, Toyama, Japan; [Kojiro, Maiko] Nagasaki Univ Hosp, Dept Infect Dis, Nagasaki, Japan; [Parry, Christopher M.] Nagasaki Univ, Sch Trop Med & Global Hlth, Dept Global Hlth, Nagasaki 852, Japan; [Parry, Christopher M.] London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, Dept Clin Res, London WC1, England","Kitashoji, E (reprint author), Nagasaki Univ, Inst Trop Med, Dept Clin Trop Med, Grad Sch Biomed Sci, Nagasaki 852, Japan.",nkoizumi@niid.go.jp; kari@nagasaki-u.ac.jp,,"Koizumi, Nobuo/0000-0002-5733-535X",Program for Enhancing Systematic Education in Graduate Schools; Japan Society for the Promotion of Science; Cooperative Research Grant of NEKKEN; National Institute of Infectious Diseases,"This study was supported by Program for Enhancing Systematic Education in Graduate Schools, Japan Society for the Promotion of Science to KA, the Cooperative Research Grant of NEKKEN 2014 and an institutional grant from National Institute of Infectious Diseases to NK.

FALCIPARUM,"Plasmodium vivax is the geographically most widespread human malaria parasite. To analyze patterns of microsatellite diversity and population structure across countries of different transmission intensity, genotyping data from 11 microsatellite markers was either generated or compiled from 841 isolates from four continents collected in 1999-2008. Diversity was highest in South-East Asia (mean allelic richness 10.0-12.8), intermediate in the South Pacific (8.1-9.9) Madagascar and Sudan (7.9-8.4), and lowest in South America and Central Asia (5.5-7.2). A reduced panel of only 3 markers was sufficient to identify approx. 90% of all haplotypes in South Pacific, African and SE-Asian populations, but only 60-80% in Latin American populations, suggesting that typing of 2-6 markers, depending on the level of endemicity, is sufficient for epidemiological studies. Clustering analysis showed distinct clusters in Peru and Brazil, but little sub-structuring was observed within Africa, SE-Asia or the South Pacific. Isolates from Uzbekistan were exceptional, as a near-clonal parasite population was observed that was clearly separated from all other populations (F-ST>0.2). Outside Central Asia F-ST values were highest (0.11-0.16) between South American and all other populations, and lowest (0.04-0.07) between populations from South-East Asia and the South Pacific. These comparisons between P. vivax populations from four continents indicated that not only transmission intensity, but also geographical isolation affect diversity and population structure.

During blood feeding, sand flies deposit into the host skin immunogenic salivary proteins which elicit specific antibody responses. These anti-saliva antibodies enable an estimate of the host exposure to sand flies and, in leishmaniasis endemic areas, also the risk for Leishmania infections. However, the use of whole salivary gland homogenates as antigen has several limitations, and therefore, recombinant salivary proteins have been tested to replace them in antibody detection assays. In this study, we have used for the first time sand fly salivary recombinant proteins in a longitudinal field study on dogs. Methodology/Principal Findings Sera from dogs naturally exposed to P. perniciosus bites over two consecutive transmission seasons in a site endemic for canine leishmaniasis (CanL) were tested at different time points by ELISA for the antibodies recognizing whole saliva, single salivary 43 kDa yellow-related recombinant protein (rSP03B), and a combination of two salivary recombinant proteins, 43 kDa yellow-related protein and 35.5 kDa apyrase (rSP01). Dogs were also tested for Leishmania infantum positivity by serology, culture, and PCR and the infection status was evaluated prospectively. We found a significant association between active CanL infection and the amount of anti-P. perniciosus saliva antibodies. Importantly, we detected a high correlation between IgG antibodies recognizing rSP03B protein and the whole salivary antigen. The kinetics of antibody response showed for both a whole saliva and rSP03B a similar pattern that was clearly related to the seasonal abundance of P. perniciosus. Conclusions These results suggest that P. perniciosus rSP03B protein is a valid alternative to whole saliva and could be used in large-scale serological studies. This novel method could be a practical and economically-sound tool to detect the host exposure to sand fly bites in CanL endemic areas.","[Kostalova, Tatiana; Lestinova, Tereza; Sumova, Petra; Vlkova, Michaela; Rohousova, Iva; Volf, Petr] Charles Univ Prague, Dept Parasitol, Fac Sci, Prague, Czech Republic; [Berriatua, Eduardo] Univ Murcia, Dept Anim Hlth, Murcia, Spain; [Oliva, Gaetano] Univ Naples Federico II, Dept Vet Med & Anim Prod, Naples, Italy; [Fiorentino, Eleonora; Scalone, Aldo; Gramiccia, Marina; Gradoni, Luigi] Ist Super Sanita, Unit Vector Borne Dis & Int Hlth, I-00161 Rome, Italy","Kostalova, T (reprint author), Charles Univ Prague, Dept Parasitol, Fac Sci, Prague, Czech Republic.",tatianakostalova@gmail.com,"Gradoni, Luigi/C-4962-2016; Spitzova, Tatiana/C-3302-2017; Sumova, Petra/C-2097-2017; Volf, Petr/C-4300-2012; Lestinova, Tereza/H-1121-2017; GRAMICCIA, MARINA/C-4969-2016; FIORENTINO, ELEONORA/C-4968-2016; Rohousova, Iva/B-4852-2011","Spitzova, Tatiana/0000-0003-2028-3530; Sumova, Petra/0000-0002-3480-7254; Volf, Petr/0000-0003-1790-1123; Lestinova, Tereza/0000-0001-5518-2268; FIORENTINO, ELEONORA/0000-0002-4980-9893; Rohousova, Iva/0000-0003-1830-0813","Charles University - EU [GAUK - 1642314/2014, 261504]","This study was partially funded by Charles University (GAUK - 1642314/2014), by the EU grant FP7-261504 EDENext, and the paper is catalogued by the EDENext Steering Committee as EDENext317 (http://www.edenext.eu) and by the EurNegVec COST Action TD1303.

Before 2004, in order to cope with the surge in adult dengue admissions, each of the six medical wards in a university hospital took turns daily to admit and manage patients with dengue. Despite regular in-house training, the implementation of the WHO 1997 dengue case management guidelines by the multiple medical teams was piecemeal and resulted in high variability of care. A restructuring of adult dengue inpatient service in 2004 resulted in all patients being admitted to one ward under the care of the infectious disease unit. Hospital and Intensive Care Unit admission criteria, discharge criteria and clinical laboratory testing were maintained unchanged throughout the study period. Objectives To evaluate the impact of cohorting adult dengue patients on the quality of care and the clinical outcome in a university hospital in Malaysia. Methods A pre (2003) and post-intervention (2005-6) retrospective study was undertaken. Intervention Cohorting all dengue patients under the care of the Infectious Disease team in a designated ward in 2004. Results The number of patients enrolled was 352 in 2003, 785 in 2005 and 1158 in 2006. The evaluation and detection of haemorrhage remained high (>90%) and unchanged throughout the study period. The evaluation of plasma leakage increased from 35.4% pre-intervention to 78.8% post-intervention (p = <0.001) while its detection increased from 11.4% to 41.6% (p = <0.001). Examination for peripheral perfusion was undertaken in only 13.1% of patients pre-intervention, with a significant increase post-intervention, 18.6% and 34.2% respectively, p = <0.001. Pre-intervention, more patients had hypotension (21.5%) than detected peripheral hypoperfusion (11.4%), indicating that clinicians recognised shock only when patients developed hypotension. In contrast, post-intervention, clinicians recognised peripheral hypoperfusion as an early sign of shock. The highest haematocrit was significantly higher post-intervention but the lowest total white cell counts and platelet counts remained unchanged. A significant and progressive reduction in the use of platelet transfusions occurred, from 21.7% pre-intervention to 14.6% in 2005 and 5.2% in 2006 post-intervention, p<0.001. Likewise, the use of plasma transfusion decreased significantly from 6.1% pre-intervention to 4.0% and 1.6% in the post-intervention years of 2005 and 2006 respectively, p<0.001. The duration of intravenous fluid therapy decreased from 3 days pre-intervention to 2.5 days (p<0.001) post-intervention; the length of hospital stay reduced from 4 days pre to 3 days (p<0.001) post-intervention and the rate of intensive care admission from 5.8% pre to 2.6% and 2.5% post-intervention, p = 0.005. Conclusion Cohorting adult dengue patients under a dedicated and trained team of doctors and nurses led to a substantial improvement in quality of care and clinical outcome.","[Lum, Lucy C.

Latent yaws represents a diagnostic challenge, and current tools cannot adequately distinguish between individuals with true latent infection and individuals who are serofast following successful treatment. PCR on blood has previously been shown to detect T. pallidum DNA in patients with syphilis, suggesting that this approach may be of value in yaws. We performed real-time PCR for Treponema pallidum ssp. pertenue on blood samples from 140 children with positive T. pallidum Particle Agglutination (TPPA) and Rapid Plasma Reagin (RPR) tests and 7 controls (negative serology), all collected as part of a prospective study of yaws in the Solomon Islands. All samples were also tested by a nested PCR for T. pallidum. 12 patients had clinical evidence of active yaws whilst 128 were considered to have latent yaws. 43 children had high titre rapid plasma reagins (RPRs) of >= 1:32. PCR testing with both assays gave negative results in all cases. It is possible that the failure to detect T. pallidum ssp. pertenue in blood reflects lower loads of organism in latent yaws compared to those in latent infection with T. pallidum ssp. pertenue, and/or a lower propensity for haematogenous dissemination in yaws than in syphilis. As the goal of the yaws control programme is eradication, a tool that can differentiate true latent infection from individuals who are serofast would be of value; however, PCR of blood is not that tool.","[Marks, Michael; Mabey, David C.; Solomon, Anthony W.] London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, Fac Infect & Trop Dis, Dept Clin Res, London WC1, England; [Marks, Michael; Mabey, David C.; Solomon, Anthony W.] Hosp Trop Dis, London NW1 0PE, England; [Katz, Samantha; Chi, Kai-Hua; Sun, Yongcheng; Chen, Cheng Y.; Pillay, Allan] Ctr Dis Control & Prevent, Lab Reference & Res Branch, Div STD Prevent, Natl Ctr HIV AIDS Viral Hepatitis STD & TB Preven, Atlanta, GA USA; [Vahi, Ventis] Minist Hlth & Med Serv, Honiara, Solomon Islands","Marks, M (reprint author), London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, Fac Infect & Trop Dis, Dept Clin Res, London WC1, England.",Michael.marks@lshtm.ac.uk,,"Solomon, Anthony/0000-0001-7101-6649; Marks, Michael/0000-0002-7585-4743; Mabey, David/0000-0002-0031-8276","United Kingdom's Department for International Development, though the Global Trachoma Mapping; Wellcome Trust Clinical Research Fellowship [102807]; Wellcome Trust Intermediate Clinical Fellowship [098521]","The fieldwork for this study was supported by the United Kingdom's Department for International Development, though the Global Trachoma Mapping grant to Sightsavers.

As part of these efforts, we describe the findings of a desk and field mission review of Haiti's rabies situation by the end of 2013. While government officials recognize the importance of dog-mediated rabies control, and the national rabies plan adequately contemplates the basic capacities to that effect, regular and sufficient implementation, for example, of dog vaccination, is hampered by limited funding. Compounding insufficient funding and human resources, official surveillance figures do not accurately reflect the risk to the population, as evidenced by the large number of rabid dogs detected by focalized and enhanced surveillance activities conducted by the Ministry of Agriculture, Natural Resources and Rural Development (MARNDR) and the Health and Population Ministry (MSPP) with the technical assistance of the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Although international support is common, either in the form of on-the-ground technical support or donations of immunobiologicals, it is not comprehensive. In addition, there is limited coordination with MARNDR/MSPP and with other actors at the strategic or operational level due to human resources limitations. Given these findings, the 2015 elimination goal in the region is compromised by the situation in Haiti where control of the disease is not yet in sight despite the best efforts of the resolute national officials. More importantly, dog-mediated rabies is still a threat to the Haitian population.","[Millien, Max F.] Minist Agr Nat Resources & Rural Dev, Port Au Prince, Haiti; [Pierre-Louis, Jocelyne B.] Minist Publ Hlth & Populat, Port Au Prince, Haiti; [Wallace, Ryan] Ctr Dis Control & Prevent, Atlanta, GA USA; [Caldas, Eduardo] Minist Hlth, Serv Vigilancia Saude, Brasilia, DF, Brazil; [Rwangabgoba, Jean M.; Poncelet, Jean L.] Pan Amer Hlth Org, Port Au Prince, Haiti; [Cosivi, Ottorino; Vilas, Victor J.

Dipetalodipin and triplatin are triatomine salivary proteins that exhibit high affinity binding to prostanoids, such as TXA2, thus resulting in potent inhibitory effect on platelet aggregation in vitro. It was recently demonstrated that platelet-derived TXA2 mediates the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps ( NETs), a newly recognized link between inflammation and thrombosis that promote thrombus growth and stability. Methodology/Principal Findings This study evaluated the ability of dipetalodipin and triplatin to block NETs formation in vitro. We also investigated the in vivo antithrombotic activity of TXA2 binding proteins by employing two murine models of experimental thrombosis. Remarkably, we observed that both inhibitors abolished the platelet-mediated formation of NETs in vitro. Dipetalodipin and triplatin significantly increased carotid artery occlusion time in a FeCl3-induced injury model. Treatment with TXA2-binding proteins also protected mice from lethal pulmonary thromboembolism evoked by the intravenous injection of collagen and epinephrine. Effective antithrombotic doses of dipetalodipin and triplatin did not increase blood loss, which was estimated using the tail transection method. Conclusions/Significance Salivary TXA2-binding proteins, dipetalodipin and triplatin, are capable to prevent platelet-mediated NETs formation in vitro. This ability may contribute to the antithrombotic effects in vivo. Notably, both molecules inhibit arterial thrombosis without promoting excessive bleeding. Our results provide new insight into the antihemostatic effects of TXA2-binding proteins and may have important significance in elucidating the mechanisms of saliva to avoid host's hemostatic responses and innate immune system.","[Mizurini, Daniella M.; Aslan, Jorgeane S.; Gomes, Taina; Monteiro, Robson Q.] Univ Fed Rio de Janeiro, Inst Bioquim Med Leopoldo de Meis, Rio De Janeiro, Brazil; [Ma, Dongying; Francischetti, Ivo M.

In Sub-Saharan Africa, cholera outbreaks primarily cluster at certain hot-spots including the African Great Lakes Region and West Africa. Methodology/Principal Findings In this study, we applied MLVA (Multi-Locus Variable Number Tandem Repeat Analysis) typing of 337 Vibrio cholerae isolates from recent cholera epidemics in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), Zambia, Guinea and Togo. We aimed to assess the relationship between outbreaks. Applying this method, we identified 89 unique MLVA haplotypes across our isolate collection. MLVA typing revealed the short-term divergence and microevolution of these Vibrio cholerae populations to provide insight into the dynamics of cholera outbreaks in each country. Our analyses also revealed strong geographical clustering. Isolates from the African Great Lakes Region (DRC and Zambia) formed a closely related group, while West African isolates (Togo and Guinea) constituted a separate cluster. At a country-level scale our analyses revealed several distinct MLVA groups, most notably DRC 2011/2012, DRC 2009, Zambia 2012 and Guinea 2012. We also found that certain MLVA types collected in the DRC persisted in the country for several years, occasionally giving rise to expansive epidemics. Finally, we found that the six environmental isolates in our panel were unrelated to the epidemic isolates. Conclusions/Significance To effectively combat the disease, it is critical to understand the mechanisms of cholera emergence and diffusion in a region-specific manner. Overall, these findings demonstrate the relationship between distinct epidemics in West Africa and the African Great Lakes Region. This study also highlights the importance of monitoring and analyzing Vibrio cholerae isolates.","[Moore, Sandra; Jeddi, Fakhri; Rebaudet, Stanislas; Piarroux, Renaud] Aix Marseille Univ, Assistance Publ Hop Marseille, Dept Parasitol & Mycol, UMR MD3, Marseille, France; [Miwanda, Berthe; Bompangue, Didier; Muyembe, Jean-Jacques] Minist Publ Hlth, Inst Natl Rech Biomed, Kinshasa, DEM REP CONGO; [Sadji, Adodo Yao; Bidjada, Bawimodom] Natl Inst Hyg, Dept Bacteriol, Lome, Togo; [Thefenne, Helene; Depina, Jean-Jacques; Garnotel, Eric] Hop Instruct Armees Laveran, Marseille, France; [de Boeck, Hilde] Inst Trop Med, Dept Clin Sci, B-2000 Antwerp, Belgium; [Bompangue, Didier; Muyembe, Jean-Jacques] Univ Kinshasa, Fac Med, Dept Microbiol, Kinshasa, DEM REP CONGO; [Bompangue, Didier] Univ Franche Comte, CNRS, Lab Chronoenvironm, UMR 6249, F-25030 Besancon, France; [Abedi, Aaron Aruna] Minist Hlth, Kinshasa, DEM REP CONGO; [Koivogui, Lamine] Inst Natl Sante Publ, Conakry, Guinea; [Keita, Sakoba] Minist Sante Publ & Hyg Publ, Div Prevent & Lutte Maladie, Conakry, Guinea; [Plisnier, Pierre-Denis] Royal Museum Cent Africa, Tervuren, Belgium; [Ruimy, Raymond] Nice Univ Hosp, Dept Clin Res, Nice, France; [Thomson, Nicholas] Wellcome Trust Sanger Inst, Pathogen Genom, Cambridge, England; [Thomson, Nicholas] London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, London WC1, England","Moore, S (reprint author), Aix Marseille Univ, Assistance Publ Hop Marseille, Dept Parasitol & Mycol, UMR MD3, Marseille, France.",Renaud.PIARROUX@ap-hm.fr,"Ruimy, Raymond/P-6068-2016; Thomson, Nicholas/P-5988-2014","Thomson, Nicholas/0000-0002-4432-8505",WHO; Epicentre; UNICEF; CHOLTIC project (Belgian Science Policy); VEOLIA Environment Foundation; AFRICHOL project; Bill AMP; Melinda Gates Foundation; Directorate General of Development Cooperation of the Belgian Government through institutional collaboration INRB-ITM; Assistance Publique - Hopitaux de Marseille; public health doctoral network of the EHESP (Ecole des hautes etudes en sante publique),"The collection of strains and biological analyses were supported by many partners, including the WHO, the VEOLIA Environment Foundation and AFRICHOL project.

Methodology/Principal Findings Compared to the wild-type, TMM001 exhibits slower growth kinetics, siderophore hypersecretion and the inability to utilize heme-containing proteins as iron sources. A series of animal challenge studies showed an inverse correlation between the percentage of survival in BALB/c mice and iron-dependent TMM001 growth. Upon evaluation of TMM001 as a potential protective strain against infection, we found 100% survival following B. mallei CSM001 challenge of mice previously receiving 1.5 x 10(4) CFU of TMM001. At 21 days post-immunization, TMM001-treated animals showed significantly higher levels of B. malleispecific IgG1, IgG2a and IgM when compared to PBS-treated controls. At 48 h post-challenge, PBS-treated controls exhibited higher levels of serum inflammatory cytokines and more severe pathological damage to target organs compared to animals receiving TMM001. In a cross-protection study of acute inhalational melioidosis with B. pseudomallei, TMM001-treated mice were significantly protected. While wild type was cleared in all B. mallei challenge studies, mice failed to clear TMM001. Conclusions/Significance Although further work is needed to prevent chronic infection by TMM001 while maintaining immunogenicity, our attenuated strain demonstrates great potential as a backbone strain for future vaccine development against both glanders and melioidosis.","[Mott, Tiffany M.; Vijayakumar, Sudhamathi; Sbrana, Elena; Endsley, Janice J.; Torres, Alfredo G.] Univ Texas Med Branch, Dept Microbiol & Immunol, Galveston, TX 77555 USA; [Sbrana, Elena; Torres, Alfredo G.] Univ Texas Med Branch, Dept Pathol, Galveston, TX 77555 USA; [Endsley, Janice J.; Torres, Alfredo G.] Univ Texas Med Branch, Sealy Ctr Vaccine Dev, Galveston, TX 77555 USA","Mott, TM (reprint author), Univ Texas Med Branch, Dept Microbiol & Immunol, Galveston, TX 77555 USA.",altorres@utmb.edu,,"Torres, Alfredo/0000-0001-6450-0643",NIH/NIAID [U54 AI057156],"The study performed in the laboratory of AGT was supported by NIH/NIAID grant U54 AI057156.

The presence of antibodies to Ebola virus (EBOV) and Marburg virus (MARV) has been reported in some African countries in individuals without a history of haemorrhagic fever. In this study, we present a MARV and EBOV seroprevalence study conducted amongst blood donors in the Republic of Congo and the analysis of risk factors for contact with EBOV. Methodology and Findings In 2011, we conducted a MARV and EBOV seroprevalence study amongst 809 blood donors recruited in rural (75; 9.3%) and urban (734; 90.7%) areas of the Republic of Congo. Serum titres of IgG antibodies to MARV and EBOV were assessed by indirect double-immunofluorescence microscopy. MARV seroprevalence was 0.5% (4 in 809) without any identified risk factors. Prevalence of IgG to EBOV was 2.5%, peaking at 4% in rural areas and in Pointe Noire. Independent risk factors identified by multivariate analysis were contact with bats and exposure to birds. Conclusions/Significance This MARV and EBOV serological survey performed in the Republic of Congo identifies a probable role for environmental determinants of exposure to EBOV. It highlights the requirement for extending our understanding of the ecological and epidemiological risk of bats (previously identified as a potential ecological reservoir) and birds as vectors of EBOV to humans, and characterising the protection potentially afforded by EBOV-specific antibodies as detected in blood donors.","[Moyen, Nanikaly; Thirion, Laurence; Boehmann, Yannik; Gallian, Pierre; Gould, Ernest A.; de Lamballerie, Xavier] Aix Marseille Univ, IRD French Inst Res Dev, EHESP French Sch Publ Hlth, EPV UMR D Emergence Pathol Virales 190, Marseille, France; [Moyen, Nanikaly; Dzia-Lepfoundzou, Amelia; Dimi, Yannick] Ctr Natl Transfus Sanguine, Brazzaville, Rep Congo; [Moyen, Nanikaly; Richet, Herve; Gallian, Pierre; de Lamballerie, Xavier] APHM Publ Hosp Marseille, IHU Mediterranee Infect, Marseille, France; [Emmerich, Petra; Guenther, Stephan] Bernhard Nocht Inst Trop Med, Dept Virol, D-20359 Hamburg, Germany; [Gallian, Pierre] Etab Francais Sang Alpes Mediterranee, Marseille, France","Moyen, N (reprint author), Aix Marseille Univ, IRD French Inst Res Dev, EHESP French Sch Publ Hlth, EPV UMR D Emergence Pathol Virales 190, Marseille, France.",moyenmimi@gmail.com,,"Gunther, Stephan/0000-0002-6562-0230",,,,58,11,11,0,21,PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE,SAN FRANCISCO,"1160 BATTERY STREET, STE 100, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94111 USA",1935-2735,,,PLOS NEGLECT TROP D,Plos Neglect.

Standardizing methods to assess treatment efficacy is important to compare trial outcomes across settings, and to monitor program effectiveness consistently. We compared customary methods and looked at possible complementary approaches in order to derive suggestions for standardizing outcome measures. Methodology/Principal Findings We analyzed data from 24 studies conducted at African, Asian, and Latin American sites, enrolling overall 4,740 individuals infected with Schistosoma mansoni, S. haematobium, orS. japonicum, and treated with praziquantel at doses of 40-80 mg/kg. We found that group-based arithmetic and geometric means can be used interchangeably to express egg reduction rates (ERR) only if treatment efficacy is high (> 95%). For lower levels of efficacy, ERR estimates are higher with geometric than arithmetic means. Using the distribution of individual responses in egg excretion, 6.3%, 1.7% and 4.3% of the subjects treated for S. haematobium, S. japonicum and S. mansoni infection, respectively, had no reduction in their egg counts (ERR = 0). The 5(th), 10(th), and 25(th) centiles of the subjects treated for S. haematobium had individual ERRs of 0%, 49.3%, and 96.5%; the corresponding values for S. japonicum were 75%, 99%, and 99%; and for S. mansoni 18.2%, 65.3%, and 99.8%. Using a single rather than quadruplicate Kato-Katz thick smear excluded 19% of S. mansoni-infected individuals. Whilst the effect on estimating ERR was negligible by individual studies, ERR estimates by arithmetic means were 8% lower with a single measurement. Conclusions/Significance Arithmetic mean calculations of Schistosoma ERR are more sensitive and therefore more appropriate to monitor drug performance than geometric means. However, neither are satisfactory to identify poor responders. Group-based response estimated by arithmetic mean and the distribution of individual ERRs are correlated, but the latter appears to be more apt to detect the presence and to quantitate the magnitude of suboptimal responses to praziquantel.","[Olliaro, Piero L.] WHO, UNICEF UNDP, WHO Special Programme Res & Training Trop Dis TDR, World Bank, CH-1211 Geneva, Switzerland; [Olliaro, Piero L.] Univ Oxford, Nuffield Dept Med, Ctr Trop Med, Oxford, England; [Vaillant, Michel] Luxembourg Inst Hlth, Ctr Competence Methodol & Stat, Strassen, Luxembourg; [Diawara, Aissatou] New York Univ Abu Dhabi, Div Sci & Math, Dept Biol, Abu Dhabi, U Arab Emirates; [Coulibaly, Jean T.; N'Goran, Eliezer K.] Univ Felix Houphouet Boigny, Unite Format & Rech Biosci, Abidjan, Cote Ivoire; [Coulibaly, Jean T.; N'Goran, Eliezer K.] Ctr Suisse Rech Sci Cote Ivoire, Abidjan, Cote Ivoire; [Coulibaly, Jean T.; Keiser, Jennifer] Swiss Trop & Publ Hlth Inst, Dept Med Parasitol & Infect Biol, Basel, Switzerland; [Coulibaly, Jean T.; Garba, Amadou; Keiser, Jennifer; Knopp, Stefanie; Raso, Giovanna; Stete, Katarina; Utzinger, Juerg] Univ Basel, Basel, Switzerland; [Garba, Amadou; Knopp, Stefanie; Raso, Giovanna; Stete, Katarina; Utzinger, Juerg] Swiss Trop & Publ Hlth Inst, Dept Epidemiol & Publ Hlth, Basel, Switzerland; [Garba, Amadou] Amenagement & Lutte RISEAL Niger, Reseau Int Schistosomoses, Niamey, Niger; [King, Charles H.] Case Western Reserve Univ, Ctr Global Hlth & Dis, Cleveland, OH 44106 USA; [King, Charles H.] Univ Georgia, Schistosomiasis Consortium Operat Res & Evaluat, Athens, GA 30602 USA; [Knopp, Stefanie] Nat Hist Museum, Dept Life Sci, Wolfson Wellcome Biomed Labs, London SW7 5BD, England; [Landoure, Aly] Inst Natl Rech Sante Publ, Bamako, Mali; [Scherrer, Alexandra U.] Univ Zurich, Univ Zurich Hosp, Div Infect Dis, Zurich, Switzerland; [Scherrer, Alexandra U.] Univ Zurich, Univ Zurich Hosp, Hosp Epidemiol, Zurich, Switzerland; [Sousa-Figueiredo, Jose Carlos] London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, Dept Infect & Trop Dis, London WC1, England; [Stete, Katarina] Univ Hosp Freiburg, Dept Med, Ctr Infect Dis & Travel Med, Freiburg, Germany; [Zhou, Xiao-Nong] Chinese Ctr Dis Control & Prevent, Natl Inst Parasit Dis, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Zhou, Xiao-Nong] WHO Collaborating Ctr Malaria Schistosomiasis & F, Key Lab Parasite & Vector Biol, Chinese Minist Hlth, Shanghai, Peoples R China","Olliaro, PL (reprint author), WHO, UNICEF UNDP, WHO Special Programme Res & Training Trop Dis TDR, World Bank, CH-1211 Geneva, Switzerland.",olliarop@who.int,"vaillant, michel/H-5635-2019","vaillant, michel/0000-0003-4714-8128; Knopp, Stefanie/0000-0001-5707-7963; King, Charles/0000-0001-8349-9270",,,,54,13,13,0,4,PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE,SAN FRANCISCO,"1160 BATTERY STREET, STE 100, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94111 USA",1935-2735,,,PLOS NEGLECT TROP D,Plos Neglect.

Whilst a large number of IDs show global spatial variation, comprehensive knowledge of these geographic patterns is poor. Here we use an objective method to prioritise mapping efforts to begin to address the large deficit in global disease maps currently available. Methodology/Principal Findings Automation of ID mapping requires bespoke methodological adjustments tailored to the epidemiological characteristics of different types of diseases. Diseases were therefore grouped into 33 clusters based upon taxonomic divisions and shared epidemiological characteristics. Disability-adjusted life years, derived from the Global Burden of Disease 2013 study, were used as a globally consistent metric of disease burden. A review of global health stakeholders, existing literature and national health priorities was undertaken to assess relative interest in the diseases. The clusters were ranked by combining both metrics, which identified 44 diseases of main concern within 15 principle clusters. Whilst malaria, HIV and tuberculosis were the highest priority due to their considerable burden, the high priority clusters were dominated by neglected tropical diseases and vector-borne parasites. Conclusions/Significance A quantitative, easily-updated and flexible framework for prioritising diseases is presented here. The study identifies a possible future strategy for those diseases where significant knowledge gaps remain, as well as recognising those where global mapping programs have already made significant progress. For many conditions, potential shared epidemiological information has yet to be exploited.","[Pigott, David M.; Howes, Rosalind E.; Wiebe, Antoinette; Battle, Katherine E.; Gething, Peter W.] Univ Oxford, Dept Zool, Spatial Ecol & Epidemiol Grp, Oxford OX1 3PS, England; [Golding, Nick; Moyes, Catherine L.; Hay, Simon I.] Univ Oxford, Wellcome Trust Ctr Human Genet, Oxford OX1 3PS, England; [Dowell, Scott F.; Farag, Tamer H.; Garcia, Andres J.; Kimball, Ann M.; Krause, L.

In Madagascar, the disease represents a significant public health problem with hundreds of human cases a year. Unfortunately, poor infrastructure makes outbreak investigations challenging. Methodology/Principal Findings DNA was extracted directly from 93 clinical samples from patients with a clinical diagnosis of plague in Madagascar in 2007. The extracted DNAs were then genotyped using three molecular genotyping methods, including, single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) typing, multi-locus variable-number tandem repeat analysis (MLVA), and Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR) analysis. These methods provided increasing resolution, respectively. The results of these analyses revealed that, in 2007, ten molecular groups, two newly described here and eight previously identified, were responsible for causing human plague in geographically distinct areas of Madagascar. Conclusions/Significance Plague in Madagascar is caused by numerous distinct types of Y. pestis. Genotyping method choice should be based upon the discriminatory power needed, expense, and available data for any desired comparisons. We conclude that genotyping should be a standard tool used in epidemiological investigations of plague outbreaks.","[Riehm, Julia M.; Zimmermann, Thomas] Bundeswehr Med Serv, Cent Inst, Munich, Germany; [Projahn, Michaela; Scholz, Holger C.] Bundeswehr Inst Microbiol, Munich, Germany; [Projahn, Michaela; Scholz, Holger C.] German Ctr Infect Dis, Munich, Germany; [Vogler, Amy J.; Andersen, Genevieve; Hall, Carina M.; Nottingham, Roxanne; Keim, Paul; Wagner, David M.] No Arizona Univ, Ctr Microbial Genet & Genom, Flagstaff, AZ 86011 USA; [Rajerison, Minoaerisoa; Soanandrasana, Rahelinirina; Andrianaivoarimanana, Voahangy] Inst Pasteur Madagascar, Antananarivo, Madagascar; [Straubinger, Reinhard K.] Inst Infect Med & Zoonoses, Munich, Germany; [Keim, Paul] Translat Genom Res Inst North, Flagstaff, AZ USA","Riehm, JM (reprint author), Bundeswehr Med Serv, Cent Inst, Munich, Germany.",juliariehm@bundeswehr.org,"Projahn, Michaela/N-8705-2019; Straubinger, Reinhard K/D-1719-2010; Projahn, Michaela/O-7430-2018","Projahn, Michaela/0000-0002-3896-3561; Projahn, Michaela/0000-0002-3896-3561; Straubinger, Reinhard/0000-0001-8382-7182","US Department of Homeland Security Science and Technology Directorate [HSHQDC-10-C-00139, DHS-09-ST-108-001, 2010-ST-108-000015]","This work was funded in part by the US Department of Homeland Security Science and Technology Directorate via awards HSHQDC-10-C-00139, DHS-09-ST-108-001 and 2010-ST-108-000015.

In this context, various species of Leishmania have been reported to inhibit or reduce the production of IL-1 beta both in vitro and in vivo. However, the mechanism whereby Leishmania parasites are able to affect IL-1 beta production and secretion by macrophages is still not fully understood. Dependent on the stimulus at hand, the maturation of IL-1 beta is facilitated by different inflammasome complexes. The NLRP3 inflammasome has been shown to be of pivotal importance in the detection of danger molecules such as inorganic crystals like asbestos, silica and malarial hemozoin, (HZ) as well as infectious agents. In the present work, we investigated whether Leishmania parasites modulate NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Using PMA-differentiated THP-1 cells, we demonstrate that Leishmania infection effectively inhibits macrophage IL-1 beta production upon stimulation. In this context, the expression and activity of the metalloprotease GP63 - a critical virulence factor expressed by all infectious Leishmania species - is a prerequisite for a Leishmania-mediated reduction of IL-1 beta secretion. Accordingly, L. mexicana, purified GP63 and GP63-containing exosomes, caused the inhibition of macrophage IL-1 beta production. Leishmania-dependent suppression of IL-1 beta secretion is accompanied by an inhibition of reactive oxygen species (ROS) production that has previously been shown to be associated with NLRP3 inflammasome activation. The observed loss of ROS production was due to an impaired PKC-mediated protein phosphorylation. Furthermore, ROS-independent inflammasome activation was inhibited, possibly due to an observed GP63-dependent cleavage of inflammasome and inflammasome-related proteins. Collectively for the first time, we herein provide evidence that the protozoan parasite Leishmania, through its surface metalloprotease GP63, can significantly inhibit NLRP3 inflammasome function and IL-1 beta production.","[Shio, Marina Tiemi; Christian, Jan Gregor; Jung, Jee Yong; Olivier, Martin] McGill Univ, Dept Microbiol & Immunol, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Shio, Marina Tiemi] Univ Fed Sao Paulo, Dept Microbiol Immunol & Parasitol, Sao Paulo, Brazil; [Christian, Jan Gregor; Olivier, Martin] McGill Univ, Ctr Hlth, McGill Int TB TB Ctr, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Christian, Jan Gregor; Olivier, Martin] McGill Univ, Ctr Hlth, Res Inst, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Chang, Kwang-Poo] Rosalind Franklin Univ Med & Sci, Chicago Med Sch, N Chicago, IL USA","Shio, MT (reprint author), McGill Univ, Dept Microbiol & Immunol, Montreal, PQ, Canada.",martin.olivier@mcgill.ca,,,Canadian Institute of Health Research [MOP-111137],"Research in Martin Olivier laboratory is supported by operating grants from the Canadian Institute of Health Research (MOP-111137).

The research presented here evaluated the design and operation of a novel treatment system, successfully used by Medecins Sans Frontieres in Haiti to disinfect CTC wastewaters in situ, eliminating the need for road haulage and disposal of the waste to a poorly-managed hazardous waste facility, thereby providing an effective barrier to disease transmission through a novel but simple sanitary intervention. The physico-chemical protocols eventually successfully treated over 600 m(3) of wastewater, achieving coagulation/flocculation and disinfection by exposure to high pH (Protocol A) and low pH (Protocol B) environments, using thermotolerant coliforms as a disinfection efficacy index. In Protocol A, the addition of hydrated lime resulted in wastewater disinfection and coagulation/flocculation of suspended solids. In Protocol B, disinfection was achieved by the addition of hydrochloric acid, followed by pH neutralization and coagulation/flocculation of suspended solids using aluminum sulfate. Removal rates achieved were: COD >99%; suspended solids >90%; turbidity >90% and thermotolerant coliforms >99.9%. The proposed approach is the first known successful attempt to disinfect wastewater in a disease outbreak setting without resorting to the alternative, untested, approach of 'super chlorination' which, it has been suggested, may not consistently achieve adequate disinfection. A basic analysis of costs demonstrated a significant saving in reagent costs compared with the less reliable approach of super-chlorination. The proposed approach to in situ sanitation in cholera treatment centers and other disease outbreak settings represents a timely response to a UN call for onsite disinfection of wastewaters generated in such emergencies, and the 'Coalition for Cholera Prevention and Control' recently highlighted the research as meriting serious consideration and further study. Further applications of the method to other emergency settings are being actively explored by the authors through discussion with the World Health Organization with regards to the ongoing Ebola outbreak","[Sozzi, Emanuele; Ebdon, James E.; Taylor, Huw] Univ Brighton, Sch Environm & Technol, Brighton, E Sussex, England; [Fabre, Kerline] MSF OCA, Port Au Prince, Haiti; [Fesselet, Jean-Francois] MSF OCA, Amsterdam, Netherlands","Sozzi, E (reprint author), Univ Brighton, Sch Environm & Technol, Brighton, E Sussex, England.",e.sozzi@brighton.ac.uk,,,Medecins Sans Frontieres-Operational Center Amsterdam; University of Brighton,"This study received funding from Medecins Sans Frontieres-Operational Center Amsterdam and a Research Challenges grant from the University of Brighton.

Many patients are undiagnosed and untreated due to its nonspecific symptoms and a lack of access to diagnostics. This study systematically reviews the literature to clarify the mortality from untreated leptospirosis. Results will help quantify the global burden of disease and guide health policies. Methodology/Principal Findings A comprehensive literature search was performed to identify untreated patient series. Included patients were symptomatic, but asymptomatic patients and those who had received antibiotics, dialysis or who were treated on Intensive Care Units were excluded. Included patients had a confirmed laboratory diagnosis by culture, PCR, or serological tests. Data was extracted and individual patient series were assessed for bias. Thirty-five studies, comprising 41 patient series and 3,390 patients, were included in the study. A high degree of bias within studies was shown due to limitations in study design, diagnostic tests and missing data. Median series mortality was 2.2% (Range 0.0 - 39.7%), but mortality was high in jaundiced patients (19.1%) (Range 0.0 - 39.7%), those with renal failure 12.1% (Range 0-25.0%) and in patients aged over 60 (60%) (Range 33.3-60%), but low in anicteric patients (0%) (Range 0-1.7%). Conclusions This systematic review contributes to our understanding of the mortality of untreated leptospirosis and provides data for the estimation of DALYs attributable to this disease. We show that mortality is significantly higher in older patients with icteric disease or renal failure but is lower in younger, anicteric patients. Increased surveillance and accurate point-of-care diagnostics are required to better understand the incidence and improve diagnosis of disease. Empirical treatment strategies should prioritize early treatment to improve outcomes from leptospirosis.","[Taylor, Andrew J.; Paris, Daniel H.; Newton, Paul N.] Mahosot Hosp, Microbiol Lab, Lao Oxford Mahosot Hosp Wellcome Trust Res Unit L, Viangchan, Laos; [Taylor, Andrew J.; Paris, Daniel H.; Newton, Paul N.] Univ Oxford, Nuffield Dept Clin Med, Churchill Hosp, Ctr Trop Med & Global Hlth, Oxford, England; [Paris, Daniel H.] Mahidol Univ, Fac Trop Med, MORU, Bangkok, Thailand","Taylor, AJ (reprint author), Mahosot Hosp, Microbiol Lab, Lao Oxford Mahosot Hosp Wellcome Trust Res Unit L, Viangchan, Laos.",Andrewtaylor9@gmail.com,,,Wellcome Trust,,,63,25,29,0,12,PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE,SAN FRANCISCO,"1160 BATTERY STREET, STE 100, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94111 USA",1935-2735,,,PLOS NEGLECT TROP D,Plos Neglect.

Shigella sonnei, which has historically been more commonly isolated in developed countries, is undergoing an unprecedented expansion across industrializing regions in Asia, Latin America, and the Middle East. The precise reasons underpinning the epidemiological distribution of the various Shigella species and this global surge in S. sonnei are unclear but may be due to three major environmental pressures. First, natural passive immunization with the bacterium Plesiomonas shigelloides is hypothesized to protect populations with poor water supplies against S. sonnei. Improving the quality of drinking water supplies would, therefore, result in a reduction in P. shigelloides exposure and a subsequent reduction in environmental immunization against S. sonnei. Secondly, the ubiquitous amoeba species Acanthamoeba castellanii has been shown to phagocytize S. sonnei efficiently and symbiotically, thus allowing the bacteria access to a protected niche in which to withstand chlorination and other harsh environmental conditions in temperate countries. Finally, S. sonnei has emerged from Europe and begun to spread globally only relatively recently. A strong selective pressure from localized antimicrobial use additionally appears to have had a dramatic impact on the evolution of the S. sonnei population. We hypothesize that S. sonnei, which exhibits an exceptional ability to acquire antimicrobial resistance genes from commensal and pathogenic bacteria, has a competitive advantage over S. flexneri, particularly in areas with poorly regulated antimicrobial use. Continuing improvement in the quality of global drinking water supplies alongside the rapid development of antimicrobial resistance predicts the burden and international distribution of S. sonnei will only continue to grow. An effective vaccine against S. sonnei is overdue and may become one of our only weapons against this increasingly dominant and problematic gastrointestinal pathogen.","[Thompson, Corinne N.; Pham Thanh Duy; Baker, Stephen] Univ Oxford, Clin Res Unit, Wellcome Trust Major Overseas Programme, Hosp Trop Dis, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam; [Thompson, Corinne N.; Baker, Stephen] Univ Oxford, Nuffield Dept Clin Med, Ctr Trop Med, Oxford, England; [Thompson, Corinne N.; Baker, Stephen] London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, London WC1, England","Thompson, CN (reprint author), Univ Oxford, Clin Res Unit, Wellcome Trust Major Overseas Programme, Hosp Trop Dis, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam.",sbaker@oucru.org,,,"Wellcome Trust [100087, 089276]",,,80,41,41,0,6,PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE,SAN FRANCISCO,"1160 BATTERY STREET, STE 100, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94111 USA",1935-2735,,,PLOS NEGLECT TROP D,Plos Neglect.

Typhi) was recently developed. In this model, ingestion of 104 CFU of Salmonella resulted in 65% of subjects developing typhoid fever (referred here as typhoid diagnosis -TD-) 5-10 days post-challenge. TD criteria included meeting clinical (oral temperature >= 38 degrees C for >= 12h) and/or microbiological (S. Typhi bacteremia) endpoints. One of the first lines of defense against pathogens are the cells of the innate immune system (e. g., monocytes, dendritic cells -DCs-). Various changes in circulating monocytes and DCs have been described in the murine S. Typhimurium model; however, whether similar changes are present in humans remains to be explored. To address these questions, a subset of volunteers (5 TD and 3 who did not develop typhoid despite oral challenge -NoTD-) were evaluated for changes in circulating monocytes and DCs. Expression of CD38 and CD40 were upregulated in monocytes and DCs in TD volunteers during the disease days (TD-0h to TD-96h). Moreover, integrin alpha 4 beta 7, a gut homing molecule, was upregulated on monocytes but not DCs. CD21 upregulation was only identified in DCs. These changes were not observed among NoTD volunteers despite the same oral challenge. Moreover, monocytes and DCs from NoTD volunteers showed increased binding to S. Typhi one day after challenge. These monocytes showed phosphorylation of p38MAPK, NFkB and Erk1/2 upon stimulation with S. Typhi-LPS-QDot micelles. In contrast, monocytes from TD volunteers showed only a moderate increase in S. Typhi binding 48h and 96h post-TD, and only Erk1/2 phosphorylation. This is the first study to describe different activation and migration profiles, as well as differential signaling patterns, in monocytes and DCs which relate directly to the clinical outcome following oral challenge with wild type S.

The largest recorded fatality from Ebola virus disease epidemic is ongoing in a few countries in West Africa, and this poses a health risk to the entire population of the world because arresting the transmission has been challenging. Vaccination is considered a key intervention that is capable of arresting further spread of the disease and preventing future outbreak. However, no vaccine has yet been approved for public use, although various recombinant vaccines are undergoing trials and approval for public use is imminent. Therefore, this study aimed to determine the acceptability of and willingness-to-pay for Ebola virus vaccine by the public. Methods The study was a community-based cross-sectional qualitative and quantitative interventional study conducted in two communities, each in two states in Nigeria. An interviewer-administered questionnaire was used to collect information on respondents' knowledge of the Ebola virus, the ways to prevent the disease, and their preventive practices, as well as their acceptability of and willingness-to-pay for a hypothetical vaccine against Ebola virus disease. The association between acceptability of the vaccine and other independent variables were evaluated using multivariate regression analysis. Results Ebola virus disease was considered to be a very serious disease by 38.5% of the 582 respondents (224/582), prior to receiving health education on Ebola virus and its vaccine. Eighty percent (80%) accepted to be vaccinated with Ebola vaccine. However, among those that accepted to be vaccinated, most would only accept after observing the outcome on others who have received the vaccine. More than 87.5% was willing to pay for the vaccine, although 55.2% was of the opinion that the vaccine should be provided free of charge. Conclusion The level of acceptability of Ebola virus vaccine among respondents was impressive ( though conditional), as well as their willingness to pay for it if the vaccine is not publicly funded. In order to achieve a high uptake of the vaccine, information and education on the vaccine should be extensively shared with the public prior to the introduction of the vaccine, and the vaccine should be provided free of charge by government.","[Ughasoro, Maduka Donatus] Univ Nigeria, Dept Paediat, Enugu, Nigeria; [Esangbedo, Dorothy Omono] Providence Hosp, Paediat Div, Lagos, Nigeria; [Tagbo, Beckie Nnenna] Univ Nigeria, Teaching Hosp, Dept Paediat, Inst Child Hlth, Ituku Ozalla, Enugu, Nigeria; [Mejeha, Ijeoma Chigozie] Fed Med Ctr, Dept Paediat, Umuahia, Abia State, Nigeria","Ughasoro, MD (reprint author), Univ Nigeria, Dept Paediat, Enugu Campus, Enugu, Nigeria.",kakatitis@yahoo.co.uk,"TAGBO, Beckie Nnenna/O-3232-2019","TAGBO, Beckie Nnenna/0000-0002-3590-2691",,,,40,9,9,0,14,PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE,SAN FRANCISCO,"1160 BATTERY STREET, STE 100, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94111 USA",1935-2735,,,PLOS NEGLECT TROP D,Plos Neglect.

It is the habitat of some highly venomous snakes and the majority of the population earns their living from agricultural activities. Under these circumstances the incidence of snakebites is expected to be high. Methods Two cross-sectional, community-based surveys were performed in Champone and Phin district, Savannakhet province, Lao PDR to estimate snakebite incidence. Multistage random sampling was used. In the first stage approximately 40% of all villages in each district were randomly selected. In the second stage 33% of all households in each village were randomly chosen. Members of the selected households were interviewed about snakebites during the previous 12 months. Results Thirty-five of 9856 interviewees reported a snakebite in a 12 month period in Champone district and 79 of 7150 interviewees in Phin district. The estimated incidence is 355 snakebites per 100,000 persons per year and 1105 per 100,000 in Champone and Phin district respectively. All snakebite victims received treatment by traditional healers or self-treatment at home and nobody went to a hospital. Incidence of snakebites, calculated on the basis of hospital records of 14 district hospitals and Savannakhet provincial hospital, ranged from 3 to 14 cases per 100,000 persons per year between 2012 and 2014. Conclusion Incidence of snakebites is high in rural communities in Laos with significant regional differences. Poverty most likely contributes significantly to the higher number of snakebites in Phin district. Hospital statistics profoundly underestimates snakebite incidence, because the majority of snakebite victims receive only treatment by traditional healers or self-treatment in their village. There is an urgent need to train medical staff and students in management of snakebite patients and make snake antivenom available to cope effectively with this important public health problem in order to prevent fatalities and disabilities.","[Vongphoumy, Inthanomchanh; Phongmany, Panom; Sydala, Sengdao; Prasith, Nouda; Blessmann, Joerg] Prov Hlth Dept Savannakhet Prov, Savannakhet, Laos; [Reintjes, Ralf] Hamburg Univ Appl Sci, Hamburg, Germany; [Blessmann, Joerg] Bernhard Nocht Inst Trop Med, D-20359 Hamburg, Germany","Vongphoumy, I (reprint author), Prov Hlth Dept Savannakhet Prov, Savannakhet, Laos.",J_Blessmann@yahoo.de,,,"Else Kroner-Fresenius Stiftung, Bad Homburg, Germany [2012_HA257]","The study was funded by Else Kroner-Fresenius Stiftung, Bad Homburg, Germany. www.ekfs.de.

D23580, a multidrug resistant clinical isolate of ST313, was previously shown to have undergone genome reduction in a manner that resembles that of the more human-restricted pathogen, Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi. It has since been shown through tissue distribution studies that D23580 is able to establish an invasive infection in chickens. However, it remains unclear whether ST313 can cause lethal disease in a non-human host following a natural course of infection. Herein we report that D23580 causes lethal and invasive disease in a murine model of infection following peroral challenge. The LD50 of D23580 in female BALB/c mice was 4.7 x 10(5) CFU. Tissue distribution studies performed 3 and 5 days post-infection confirmed that D23580 was able to more rapidly colonize the spleen, mesenteric lymph nodes and gall bladder in mice when compared to the well-characterized S. Typhimurium strain SL1344. D23580 exhibited enhanced resistance to acid stress relative to SL1344, which may lend towards increased capability to survive passage through the gastrointestinal tract as well as during its intracellular lifecycle. Interestingly, D23580 also displayed higher swimming motility relative to SL1344, S. Typhi strain Ty2, and the ST313 strain A130. Biochemical tests revealed that D23580 shares many similar metabolic features with SL1344, with several notable differences in the Voges-Proskauer and catalase tests, as well alterations in melibiose, and inositol utilization. These results represent the first full duration infection study using an ST313 strain following the entire natural course of disease progression, and serve as a benchmark for ongoing and future studies into the pathogenesis of D23580.","[Yang, Jiseon; Barrila, Jennifer; Roland, Kenneth L.; Kilbourne, Jacquelyn; Forsyth, Rebecca J.; Nickerson, Cheryl A.] Arizona State Univ, Biodesign Inst, Ctr Infect Dis & Vaccinol, Tempe, AZ 85281 USA; [Ott, C.

Identifying risk factors for active disease that are amenable to intervention is important to successfully design such programs. Previous studies have linked sleeping by a cooking fire to trachoma in children, but not fully explored the mechanism and risks. We propose to determine the risk for active trachoma in children with exposure to cooking fires by severity of trachoma, adjusting for other known risk factors. Methods Complete census of 52 communities in Kongwa, Tanzania, was conducted to collect basic household characteristics and demographic information on each family member. Information on exposure to indoor cooking fires while the mother was cooking and while sleeping for each child was collected. 6656 randomly selected children ages 1-9yrs were invited to a survey where both eyelids were graded for follicular (TF) and intense trachoma (TI) using the WHO simplified grading scheme. Ocular swab were taken to assess the presence of Chlamydia trachomatis. Findings 5240 (79%) of the invited children participated in the study. Overall prevalence for trachoma was 6.1%. Odds for trachoma and increased severity were higher in children sleeping without ventilation and a cooking fire in their room (TF OR = 1.81, 1.00-3.27 and TI OR 4.06, 1.96-8.42). Children with TF or TI who were exposed were more likely to have infection than children with TF or TI who were not exposed. There was no increased risk with exposure to a cooking fire while the mother was cooking. Conclusions In addition to known risk factors for trachoma, sleeping by an indoor cooking fire in a room without ventilation was associated with active trachoma and appears to substantially increase the risk of intense inflammation.","[Zambrano, Andrea I.; Munoz, Beatriz E.; West, Sheila K.] Johns Hopkins Univ Hosp, Wilmer Eye Inst, Baltimore, MD 21287 USA; [Mkocha, Harran] Kongwa Trachoma Project, Kongwa, Tanzania","Zambrano, AI (reprint author), Johns Hopkins Univ Hosp, Wilmer Eye Inst, Baltimore, MD 21287 USA.",azambra1@jhmi.edu,,,National Institutes of Health [EY022584],"This study was supported by National Institutes of Health grant number EY022584.

Ebola is not new to Africa, and outbreaks have been confirmed as far back as 1976. The current West African Ebola outbreak is the largest ever recorded and differs dramatically from prior outbreaks in its duration, number of people affected, and geographic extent. The emergence of this deadly disease in West Africa invites many questions, foremost among these: why now, and why in West Africa? Here, we review the sociological, ecological, and environmental drivers that might have influenced the emergence of Ebola in this region of Africa and its spread throughout the region. Containment of the West African Ebola outbreak is the most pressing, immediate need. A comprehensive assessment of the drivers of Ebola emergence and sustained human-to-human transmission is also needed in order to prepare other countries for importation or emergence of this disease. Such assessment includes identification of country-level protocols and interagency policies for outbreak detection and rapid response, increased understanding of cultural and traditional risk factors within and between nations, delivery of culturally embedded public health education, and regional coordination and collaboration, particularly with governments and health ministries throughout Africa. Public health education is also urgently needed in countries outside of Africa in order to ensure that risk is properly understood and public concerns do not escalate unnecessarily. To prevent future outbreaks, coordinated, multiscale, early warning systems should be developed that make full use of these integrated assessments, partner with local communities in high-risk areas, and provide clearly defined response recommendations specific to the needs of each community.","[Alexander, Kathleen A.; Sanderson, Claire E.] Virginia Tech, Dept Fisheries & Wildlife Conservat, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA; [Marathe, Madav] Virginia Tech, Dept Comp Sci, Blacksburg, VA USA; [Marathe, Madav; Lewis, Bryan L.; Rivers, Caitlin M.; Lofgren, Eric; Eubank, Stephen] Virginia Tech, Virginia Bioinformat Inst, Network Dynam & Simulat Sci Lab, Blacksburg, VA USA; [Shaman, Jeffrey] Columbia Univ, Dept Environm Hlth Sci, Mailman Sch Publ Hlth, New York, NY USA; [Drake, John M.] Univ Georgia, Odum Sch Ecol, Athens, GA 30602 USA; [Dato, Virginia M.] Univ Pittsburgh, Sch Med, Dept Biomed Informat, Pittsburgh, PA USA; [Eisenberg, Marisa C.] Univ Michigan, Dept Epidemiol, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Eisenberg, Marisa C.] Univ Michigan, Dept Math, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA","Alexander, KA (reprint author), Virginia Tech, Dept Fisheries & Wildlife Conservat, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA.",kathyalx@vt.edu,"Eubank, Stephen/D-7497-2011","Eubank, Stephen/0000-0002-7177-309X; Drake, John/0000-0003-4646-1235","DTRA CNIMS [HDTRA1-11-D-0016-0001]; National Institute of General Medical Sciences of the National Institutes of Health [5U01GM070694-11, U01 GM110748]; RAPIDD program of the Science and Technology Directorate; US Department of Homeland Security; NLM Pittsburgh Biomedical Informatics Training Grant [5T15 LM007059-28]","This work has been partially supported by DTRA CNIMS Contract HDTRA1-11-D-0016-0001.

The low reporting can be attributed to limited capacity of epidemiological surveillance and laboratories, as well as social, political, and economic disincentives for reporting. We previously estimated 2.8 million cases and 91,000 deaths annually due to cholera in 51 endemic countries. A major limitation in our previous estimate was that the endemic and non-endemic countries were defined based on the countries' reported cholera cases. We overcame the limitation with the use of a spatial modelling technique in defining endemic countries, and accordingly updated the estimates of the global burden of cholera. Methods/Principal Findings Countries were classified as cholera endemic, cholera non-endemic, or cholera-free based on whether a spatial regression model predicted an incidence rate over a certain threshold in at least three of five years (2008-2012). The at-risk populations were calculated for each country based on the percent of the country without sustainable access to improved sanitation facilities. Incidence rates from population-based published studies were used to calculate the estimated annual number of cases in endemic countries. The number of annual cholera deaths was calculated using inverse variance-weighted average case-fatality rate (CFRs) from literature-based CFR estimates. We found that approximately 1.3 billion people are at risk for cholera in endemic countries. An estimated 2.86 million cholera cases (uncertainty range: 1.3m-4.0m) occur annually in endemic countries. Among these cases, there are an estimated 95,000 deaths (uncertainty range: 21,000-143,000). Conclusion/Significance The global burden of cholera remains high. Sub-Saharan Africa accounts for the majority of this burden. Our findings can inform programmatic decision-making for cholera control.","[Ali, Mohammad; Nelson, Allyson R.; Sack, David A.] Johns Hopkins Bloomberg Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Int Hlth, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA; [Lopez, Anna Lena] Univ Philippines Manila, Natl Inst Hlth, Manila, Philippines","Ali, M (reprint author), Johns Hopkins Bloomberg Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Int Hlth, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA.",mali25@jhu.edu,"Ali, Mohammad/E-2365-2017","Ali, Mohammad/0000-0003-1410-388X; Nelson, Allyson/0000-0002-1910-5422",Delivering Oral Vaccine Effectively (DOVE) project; Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation,"This study was supported by the Delivering Oral Vaccine Effectively (DOVE) project.

Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), a lymphotropic virus with high rates of replication, leads to cell death in various stages of infection. These diseases have major social and quality of life costs, and although the relevance of their comorbidity is recognized, several aspects are still not fully understood. Methodology/Principal Findings Two cohorts of patients with leprosy in an endemic region of the Amazon were observed. We compared 40 patients with leprosy and HIV (Group 1) and 107 leprosy patients with no comorbidity (Group 2) for a minimum of 2 years. Group 1 predominantly experienced the paucibacillary classification, accounting for 70% of cases, whereas Group 2 primarily experienced the multibacillary classification (80.4% of cases). There was no significant difference in the prevalence of leprosy reactions among the two groups (37.5% for Group 1 vs. 56.1% for Group 2), and the most frequent reaction was Type 1. The appearance of Group 1 patients' reversal reaction skin lesions was consistent with each clinical form: typically erythematous and infiltrated, with similar progression as those patients without HIV, which responded to prednisone. Patients in both groups primarily experienced a single episode (73.3% in Group 1 and 75% in Group 2), and Group 1 had shorter reaction periods (<= 3 months; 93.3%), moderate severity (80%), with 93.3% of the patients in the state of acquired immune deficiency syndrome, and 46.7% presenting the reaction at the time of the immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome. Conclusions/Significance This study used a large sample and makes a significant contribution to the clinical outcomes of patients in the reactive state with comorbid HIV and leprosy. The data indicate that these diseases, although concurrent, have independent courses.","[Avelar Pires, Carla Andrea; Xavier, Marilia Brasil] Fed Univ Para, Dept Dermatol, Div Trop Skin Dis, Sect Leprosy, BR-66059 Belem, Para, Brazil; [Avelar Pires, Carla Andrea; Machado Juca Neto, Fernando Octavio; Xavier, Marilia Brasil] Univ Estado Para, Sect Leprosy, Div Trop Skin Dis, Dept Dermatol, Belem, Para, Brazil; [de Albuquerque, Nahima Castelo; Madureira Batista, Keila de Nazare; Xavier, Marilia Brasil] Fed Univ Para, Sect Leprosy, Div Trop Dis, Dept Infect Dis, BR-66059 Belem, Para, Brazil; [Moraes Macedo, Geraldo Mariano] Fed Univ Para, Dept Infect Dis, Div Trop Dis, Sect Epidemiol Vigilance, BR-66059 Belem, Para, Brazil","Pires, CAA (reprint author), Fed Univ Para, Dept Dermatol, Div Trop Skin Dis, Sect Leprosy, BR-66059 Belem, Para, Brazil.",mariliabrasil@terra.com.br,,,,,,50,6,8,0,0,PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE,SAN FRANCISCO,"1160 BATTERY STREET, STE 100, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94111 USA",1935-2735,,,PLOS NEGLECT TROP D,Plos Neglect.

All 21 in vitro hits were used in a subsequent similarity search-based in silico screening on a database containing 200,000 physically available compounds. The similarity search resulted in a data set containing 1,204 potential TR inhibitors, which was subjected to a second in vitro screening campaign leading to 61 additional active compounds. This corresponds to an approximately 10-fold enrichment compared to the initial pure in vitro screening. In total, 82 novel TR inhibitors with activities down to the nM range could be identified proving the validity of our combined in vitro/in silico approach. Moreover, the four most active compounds, showing IC50 values of < 1 mu M, were selected for determining the inhibitor constant.

Methodology/Principal Findings Our study, conducted in Salvador, Brazil, established the average load of leptospires in positive kidneys to be 5.9 x 10(6) per mL (range 3.1-8.2 x10(6)) genome equivalents (GEq), similar to the 6.1 x 10(6) per ml (range 2.2-9.4 x10(6)) average obtained from paired urines, with a significant positive correlation (R-2=0.78) between the two. Based on bivariate and multivariate modeling, we found with both kidney and urine samples that leptospiral loads increased with the age of rats (based on the index of body length to mass), MAT titer and the presence of wounding/scars, and varied with site of capture. Some associations were modified by sex but trends were apparent. Combining with data on the demographic properties and prevalence of leptospiral carriage in rat populations in Salvador, we estimated that daily leptospiral loads shed in the urine of a population of 82 individuals exceeded 9.1 x 10(10) leptospires. Conclusions/Significance These factors directly influence the risk of leptospiral acquisition among humans and provide essential epidemiological information linking properties of rat populations with risk of human infection.","[Costa, Federico; De Oliveira, Daiana; Reis, Mitermayer G.; Ko, Albert I.] Fundacao Oswaldo Cruz, Ctr Pesquisas Goncalo Moniz, Minist Saude, Salvador, BA, Brazil; [Costa, Federico] Univ Fed Bahia UFBA, Inst Saude Colet, Salvador, BA, Brazil; [Costa, Federico; Wunder, Elsio A., Jr.; Bisht, Vimla; Reis, Mitermayer G.; Ko, Albert I.; Childs, James E.] Yale Univ, Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Epidemiol Microbial Dis, New Haven, CT USA; [Costa, Federico; Begon, Mike] Univ Liverpool, Inst Integrat Biol, Liverpool L69 3BX, Merseyside, England; [Rodrigues, Gorete] Minist Saude, Ctr Controle Zoonoses, Secretaria Municipal Saude, Salvador, BA, Brazil","Costa, F (reprint author), Fundacao Oswaldo Cruz, Ctr Pesquisas Goncalo Moniz, Minist Saude, Salvador, BA, Brazil.",fcosta2001@gmail.com,"Wunder, Elsio Augusto/C-2733-2013; Ko, Albert Icksang/P-2343-2015; Costa, Federico/G-1838-2015","Wunder, Elsio Augusto/0000-0002-5239-8511; Ko, Albert Icksang/0000-0001-9023-2339; Costa, Federico/0000-0001-6951-2336","Oswaldo Cruz Foundation; Secretariat of Health Surveillance; Brazilian Ministry of Health; National Institutes of Health [F31 AI114245, R01 AI052473, U01 AI088752, R01 TW009504, R25 TW009338]; Wellcome Trust [102330/Z/13/Z]","This work was supported by the Oswaldo Cruz Foundation and Secretariat of Health Surveillance, Brazilian Ministry of Health, the National Institutes of Health (grants F31 AI114245, R01 AI052473, U01 AI088752, R01 TW009504 and R25 TW009338) and by the Wellcome Trust (102330/Z/13/Z).

For example, it continues to spread in eastern Indonesia and currently threatens adjacent rabies-free regions with high densities of free-roaming dogs, including remote northern Australia. Mathematical and simulation disease models are useful tools to provide insights on the most effective control strategies and to inform policy decisions. Existing rabies models typically focus on long-term control programs in endemic countries. However, simulation models describing the dog rabies incursion scenario in regions where rabies is still exotic are lacking. We here describe such a stochastic, spatially explicit rabies simulation model that is based on individual dog information collected in two remote regions in northern Australia. Illustrative simulations produced plausible results with epidemic characteristics expected for rabies outbreaks in disease free regions (mean R-0 1.7, epidemic peak 97 days post-incursion, vaccination as the most effective response strategy). Systematic sensitivity analysis identified that model outcomes were most sensitive to seven of the 30 model parameters tested. This model is suitable for exploring rabies spread and control before an incursion in populations of largely free-roaming dogs that live close together with their owners. It can be used for ad-hoc contingency or response planning prior to and shortly after incursion of dog rabies in previously free regions. One challenge that remains is model parameterisation, particularly how dogs' roaming and contacts and biting behaviours change following a rabies incursion in a previously rabies free population.","[Duerr, Salome; Ward, Michael P.] Univ Sydney, Fac Vet Sci, Camden, NSW, Australia","Durr, S (reprint author), Univ Sydney, Fac Vet Sci, Camden, NSW, Australia.",salomeduerr@gmx.ch,"Ward, Michael P/C-5758-2009; Ward, Michael/W-1897-2019; Durr, Salome/C-1343-2014","Ward, Michael P/0000-0002-9921-4986; Ward, Michael/0000-0002-9921-4986; Durr, Salome/0000-0002-7321-5980",Wildlife and Exotic Disease Preparedness Program; Australian Department of Agriculture; Swiss National Science Foundation [PASMP3142737],"The study was funded by the Wildlife and Exotic Disease Preparedness Program, Australian Department of Agriculture and the Swiss National Science Foundation (grant number PASMP3142737).

The current clinical and preclinical pipeline for T. cruzi is extremely sparse and lacks drug target diversity. Methodology/Principal Findings In the present study we developed a computational approach that utilized data from several public whole- cell, phenotypic high throughput screens that have been completed for T. cruzi by the Broad Institute, including a single screen of over 300,000 molecules in the search for chemical probes as part of the NIH Molecular Libraries program. We have also compiled and curated relevant biological and chemical compound screening data including (i) compounds and biological activity data from the literature, (ii) high throughput screening datasets, and (iii) predicted metabolites of T. cruzi metabolic pathways. This information was used to help us identify compounds and their potential targets. We have constructed a Pathway Genome Data Base for T. cruzi. In addition, we have developed Bayesian machine learning models that were used to virtually screen libraries of compounds. Ninety-seven compounds were selected for in vitro testing, and 11 of these were found to have EC50 < 10 mu M. We progressed five compounds to an in vivo mouse efficacy model of Chagas disease and validated that the machine learning model could identify in vitro active compounds not in the training set, as well as known positive controls. The antimalarial pyronaridine possessed 85.2% efficacy in the acute Chagas mouse model. We have also proposed potential targets (for future verification) for this compound based on structural similarity to known compounds with targets in T. cruzi. Conclusions/Significance We have demonstrated how combining chemoinformatics and bioinformatics for T. cruzi drug discovery can bring interesting in vivo active molecules to light that may have been overlooked. The approach we have taken is broadly applicable to other NTDs.","[Ekins, Sean; Kallel, E.

The most advanced vaccine is the chimeric tetravalent CYD-TDV vaccine of Sanofi Pasteur. This vaccine has recently cleared Phase III, and efficacy results have been published. Excellent tetravalent seroconversion was seen, yet the protective efficacy against infection was surprisingly low. Here, we will describe the complicating factors involved in the generation of a safe and efficacious dengue vaccine. Furthermore, we will discuss the human antibody responses during infection, including the epitopes targeted in humans. Also, we will discuss the current understanding of the assays used to evaluate antibody response.

One such agent, Burkholderia pseudomallei, a soil bacterium and the causative agent of melioidosis, is lacking in this area because of its genomic diversity and widespread geographic distribution. The Burkholderia genus contains over 60 species and occupies a large range of environments including soil, plants, rhizospheres, water, animals and humans. The identification of novel species in new locations necessitates the need to identify the true global distribution of Burkholderia species, especially the members that are closely related to B. pseudomallei. In our current study, we used the Burkholderia-specific recA sequencing assay to analyze environmental samples from the Darwin region in the Northern Territory of Australia where melioidosis is endemic. Burkholderia recA PCR negative samples were further characterized using 16s rRNA sequencing for species identification. Phylogenetic analysis demonstrated that over 70% of the bacterial isolates were identified as B. ubonensis indicating that this species is common in the soil where B. pseudomallei is endemic. Bayesian phylogenetic analysis reveals many novel branches within the B. cepacia complex, one novel B. oklahomensis-like species, and one novel branch containing one isolate that is distinct from all other samples on the phylogenetic tree. During the analysis with recA sequencing, we discovered 2 single nucleotide polymorphisms in the reverse priming region of B. oklahomensis. A degenerate primer was developed and is proposed for future use. We conclude that the recA sequencing technique is an effective tool to classify Burkholderia and identify soil organisms in a melioidosis endemic area.","[Ginther, Jennifer L.; Warrington, Stephanie D.; Mullins, Travis; Wagner, David M.; Tuanyok, Apichai; Keim, Paul] No Arizona Univ, Ctr Microbial Genet & Genom, Flagstaff, AZ 86011 USA; [Mayo, Mark; Kaestli, Mirjam; Currie, Bart J.] Menzies Sch Hlth Res, Casuarina, NT, Australia; [Tuanyok, Apichai] Univ Florida, Dept Infect Dis & Pathol, Gainesville, FL USA; [Keim, Paul] Translat Genom Res Inst, Pathogen Genom Div, Flagstaff, AZ USA","Ginther, JL (reprint author), No Arizona Univ, Ctr Microbial Genet & Genom, Flagstaff, AZ 86011 USA.",paul.keim@nau.edu,,", Mirjam/0000-0002-6053-5141",Department of Homeland Security; Defence Threat Reduction Agency of the United States Government,"The sponsors were the Department of Homeland Security and the Defense Threat Reduction Agency of the United States Government.

We assessed the knowledge, attitudes and practices of animal bite victims attending an anti-rabies health center in Jimma Town, Ethiopia. Methodology/Principal Findings Between July 2012 and March 2013 a cross-sectional questionnaire was administered to 384 bite victims or their guardians in the case of minors (aged < 15 years). Factors associated with knowledge, attitudes and practices were evaluated using generalized linear models. Almost all participants (99%) were aware that rabies was transmitted by the bite or lick of a rabid dog, however only 20.1% identified ""germs"" as the cause of disease. A majority of participants stated rabies could be prevented by avoiding dog bites (64.6%) and confining dogs (53.9%); fewer (41.7%) recognized vaccination of dogs/cats as an important preventive strategy. Regarding attitudes, most (91.1%) agreed that medical evaluation should be sought as soon as possible. However, most (75.0%) also believed that traditional healers could cure rabies. Rural residence (adjusted odds ratio [ OR] = 2.1, p = 0.015) and Protestant religion (OR = 2.4, p = 0.041) were independently associated with this belief. Among 186 participants who owned dogs, only 9 (4.8%) had ever vaccinated their dog and more than 90% of respondents indicated that their dog was free-roaming or cohabitated with the family. Only 7.0% of participants applied correct first aid following exposure, and the majority (47.7%) reported that the animal was killed by the community following the incident. Female sex and Muslim religion were independently associated with higher and lower practices scores, respectively, due largely to differences in animal management practices following the incident. Conclusions/Significance Although respondents demonstrated reasonably sound knowledge of rabies and its transmission, attitudes and practices were inconsistent with rabies prevention. Culturally-and gender-sensitive activities that promote proper first aid and healthcare seeking behavior as well as appropriate animal management, particularly in rural areas, are needed to prevent deaths associated with rabies in this setting.","[Kabeta, Tadele; Deresa, Benti; Tigre, Worku] Jimma Univ, Coll Agr & Vet Med, Jimma, Ethiopia; [Kabeta, Tadele] Wollega Univ, Coll Med & Hlth Sci, Sch Vet Med, Nekemte, Ethiopia; [Ward, Michael P.; Mor, Siobhan M.] Univ Sydney, Fac Vet Sci, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia; [Mor, Siobhan M.] Univ Sydney, Marie Bashir Inst Infect Dis & Biosecur, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia","Kabeta, T (reprint author), Jimma Univ, Coll Agr & Vet Med, Jimma, Ethiopia.",siobhan.mor@sydney.edu.au,"Ward, Michael P/C-5758-2009; Ward, Michael/W-1897-2019","Ward, Michael P/0000-0002-9921-4986; Ward, Michael/0000-0002-9921-4986; Mor, Siobhan/0000-0003-0121-2016",office of Jimma University College of Agriculture and Veterinary Medicine,"We would like to thank the postgraduate and research coordinating office of Jimma University College of Agriculture and Veterinary Medicine for financially supporting this study (TK, BD, WT).

We characterised the gut microbiome of children exposed to the helminth Schistosoma haematobium pre- and post-treatment with the drug praziquantel (PZQ), with the aim to compare the gut microbiome structure (abundance and diversity) in schistosome infected vs. uninfected children. Methods Stool DNA from 139 children aged six months to 13 years old; with S. haematobium infection prevalence of 27.34% was extracted at baseline. 12 weeks following antihelminthic treatment with praziqunatel, stool DNA was collected from 62 of the 139 children. The 16S rRNA genes were sequenced from the baseline and post-treatment samples and the sequence data, clustered into operational taxonomic units (OTUs). The OTU data were analysed using multivariate analyses and paired T-test. Results Pre-treatment, the most abundant phyla were Bacteroidetes, followed by Firmicutes and Proteobacteria respectively. The relative abundance of taxa among bacterial classes showed limited variation by age group or sex and the bacterial communities had similar overall compositions. Although there were no overall differences in the microbiome structure across the whole age range, the abundance of 21 OTUs varied significantly with age (FDR<0.05). Some OTUs including Veillonella, Streptococcus, Bacteroides and Helicobacter were more abundant in children <= 1 year old compared to older children. Furthermore, the gut microbiome differed in schistosome infected vs. uninfected children with 27 OTU occurring in infected but not uninfected children, for 5 of these all Prevotella, the difference was statistically significant (p <0.05) with FDR <0.05. PZQ treatment did not alter the microbiome structure in infected or uninfected children from that observed at baseline. Conclusions There are significant differences in the gut microbiome structure of infected vs. uninfected children and the differences were refractory to PZQ treatment.","[Kay, Gemma Louise; Millard, Andrew; Sergeant, Martin J.; Pallen, Mark] Univ Warwick, Warwick Med Sch, Div Translat & Syst Med, Microbiol & Infect Unit, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England; [Midzi, Nicholas] Natl Inst Hlth Res, Harare, Zimbabwe; [Gwisai, Reggis] Murewa Dist Hosp, Murewa, Zimbabwe; [Mduluza, Takafira] Univ Zimbabwe, Dept Biochem, Harare, Zimbabwe; [Ivens, Alasdair; Nausch, Norman; Mutapi, Francisca] Univ Edinburgh, Sch Biol Sci, Ctr Immunol Infect & Evolut, Insitute Immunol & Infect Res,Ashworth Labs, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland","Kay, GL (reprint author), Univ Warwick, Warwick Med Sch, Div Translat & Syst Med, Microbiol & Infect Unit, Gibbet Hill Campus, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England.",f.mutapi@ed.ac.uk,"Nausch, Norman/L-9276-2013; Nausch, Norman/M-4526-2019","Nausch, Norman/0000-0002-9704-2148; Nausch, Norman/0000-0002-9704-2148; Pallen, Mark/0000-0003-1807-3657; Mutapi, Francisca/0000-0002-2537-3466; Kay, Gemma/0000-0002-1176-8459; Ivens, Al/0000-0002-0112-3876","World Health Organization; Wellcome Trust, UK [WT082028MA]; Thrasher Research Fund [02832-5]","The investigation received financial support from the World Health Organization (www.who.int/) and The Wellcome Trust, UK (Grant no WT082028MA) (www.wellcome.ac.uk) and the Thrasher Research Fund (Grant number 02832-5) (https://www.thrasherresearch.org).

Given strong public interests in potential dengue vaccines, it is essential to understand the private economic benefits of dengue vaccines for accelerated introduction of vaccines into the public sector program and private markets of high-risk countries. Methodology/ Principal Findings A contingent valuation study for a hypothetical dengue vaccine was administered to 400 households in a multi-country setting: Vietnam, Thailand, and Colombia. All respondents received a description of the hypothetical dengue vaccine scenarios of 70% or 95% effectiveness for 10 or 30 years with a three dose series. Five price points were determined after pilot tests in order to reflect different local situations such as household income levels and general perceptions towards dengue fever. We adopted either Poisson or negative binomial regression models to calculate average willingness-to-pay (WTP), as well as median WTP. We found that there is a significant demand for dengue vaccines. The parametric median WTP is $26.4 ($8.8 per dose) in Vietnam, $70.3 ($23.4 per dose) in Thailand, and $23 ($7.7 per dose) in Colombia. Our study also suggests that respondents place more value on vaccinating young children than school age children and adults. Conclusions/Significance Knowing that dengue vaccines are not yet available, our study provides critical information to both public and private sectors. The study results can be used to ensure broad coverage with an affordable price and incorporated into cost benefit analyses, which can inform prioritization of alternative health interventions at the national level.","[Lee, Jung-Seok; Mogasale, Vittal; Lim, Jacqueline K.; Carabali, Mabel; Lee, Kang-Sung; da Silva, Luiz J.; Maskery, Brian A.] Int Vaccine Inst, Seoul, South Korea; [Sirivichayakul, Chukiat; Limkittikul, Kriengsak; Chanthavanich, Pornthep] Mahidol Univ, Fac Trop Med, Dept Trop Pediat, Bangkok, Thailand; [Dang Duc Anh; Vu Dinh Thiem] Natl Inst Hyg & Epidemiol, Hanoi, Vietnam; [Le Huu Tho] Khanh Hoa Hlth Serv, Nha Trang, Vietnam; [Velez, Ivan D.] Univ Antioquia, Programa Estudio & Control Enfermedades Trop, Medellin, Colombia; [Osorio, Jorge E.] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Pathobiol Sci, Madison, WI 53706 USA","Lee, JS (reprint author), Int Vaccine Inst, Seoul, South Korea.",jslee@ivi.int,"Mogasale, Vittal/H-3156-2019; Mogasale, Vittal/C-7853-2011","Vu, Thiem/0000-0001-6168-4555; Mogasale, Vittal/0000-0003-0596-8072; Carabali, Mabel/0000-0002-9171-0483",Bill & Melinda Gates foundation [OPP1016669],"This work was supported by the Bill & Melinda Gates foundation [grant number OPP1016669] [URL http://www.gatesfoundation.org/].

There is concern that STH infections may detrimentally affect children's healthy development, including their cognitive ability, nutritional status, and school performance. Medical studies have not yet identified the exact nature of the impact STH infections have on children. The objective of this study is to examine the relationship between STH infections and developmental outcomes among a primary school-aged population in rural China. Methodology/Principal Findings We conducted a large-scale survey in Guizhou province in southwest China in May 2013. A total of 2,179 children aged 9-11 years living in seven nationally-designated poverty counties in rural China served as our study sample. Overall, 42 percent of the sample's elementary school-aged children were infected with one or more of the three types of STH-Ascaris lumbricoides (ascaris), Trichuris trichuria (whipworm) and the hookworms Ancylostoma duodenale or Necator americanus. After controlling for socioeconomic status, we observed that infection with one or more STHs is associated with worse cognitive ability, worse nutritional status, and worse school performance than no infection. This study also presents evidence that children with Trichuris infection, either infection with Trichuris only or co-infected with Trichuris and Ascaris, experience worse cognitive, nutritional and schooling outcomes than their uninfected peers or children infected with only Ascaris. Conclusions/Significance We find that STH infection still poses a significant health challenge among children living in poor, rural, ethnic areas of southwest China. Given the important linkages we find between STH infection and a number of important child health and educational outcomes, we believe that our results will contribute positively to the debate surrounding the recent Cochrane report.","[Liu, Chengfang; Luo, Renfu; Yi, Hongmei; Zhang, Linxiu; Li, Shaoping; Bai, Yunli] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resource Res, Ctr Chinese Agr Policy, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Li, Shaoping; Bai, Yunli] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Medina, Alexis; Rozelle, Scott] Stanford Univ, Freeman Spogli Inst, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Smith, Scott] Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Wang, Guofei; Wang, Jujun] Chinese Ctr Dis Control & Prevent, Natl Inst Parasit Dis, Shanghai, Peoples R China","Liu, CF (reprint author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resource Res, Ctr Chinese Agr Policy, Beijing, Peoples R China.",luorf.ccap@igsnrr.ac.cn,,"Yi, Hongmei/0000-0002-6934-0498","National Natural Science Foundation of China [71473240, 71333012, 71103171, 71473239]; International Initiative for Impact Evaluation (3IE) [PW2.04.02.02]; UBS Optimus Foundation; Stanford University Global Underdevelopment Action Fund","The authors acknowledge financial support from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (grant numbers 71473240, 71333012, 71103171 and 71473239), the International Initiative for Impact Evaluation (3IE, grant number PW2.04.02.02), the UBS Optimus Foundation, and the Stanford University Global Underdevelopment Action Fund.

Clinical diagnosis of sparganosis is difficult because there are no specific manifestations. ELISA using plerocercoid crude or excretory-secretory (ES) antigens has high sensitivity but has cross-reactions with other helminthiases. The aim of this study was to characterize Spirometra erinaceieuropaei cysteine protease (SeCP) and to evaluate its potential application for serodiagnosis of sparganosis. Methodology/Principal Findings The full length SeCP gene was cloned, and recombinant SeCP (rSeCP) was expressed and purified. Western blotting showed that rSeCP was recognized by the serum of sparganum-infected mice, and anti-rSeCP serum recognized the native SeCP protein of plerocercoid crude or ES antigens. Expression of SeCP was observed at plerocercoid stages but not at the adult and egg stages. Immunolocalization identified SeCP in plerocercoid tegument and parenchymal tissue. The rSeCP had CP activity, and the optimum pH and temperature were 5.5 and 37 degrees C, respectively. Enzymatic activity was significantly inhibited by E-64. rSeCP functions to degrade different proteins and the function was inhibited by anti-rSeCP serum and E-64. Immunization of mice with rSeCP induced Th2-predominant immune responses and anti-rSeCP antibodies had the potential capabilities to kill plerocercoids in an ADCC assay. The sensitivity of rSeCP-ELISA and ES antigen ELISA was 100% when performed on sera of patients with sparganosis. The specificity of rSeCP-ELISA and ES antigen ELISA was 98.22% (166/169) and 87.57% (148/169), respectively (P<0.05). Conclusions The rSeCP had the CP enzymatic activity and SeCP seems to be important for the survival of plerocercoids in host. The rSeCP is a potential diagnostic antigen for sparganosis.","[Liu, Li Na; Wang, Zhong Quan; Zhang, Xi; Jiang, Peng; Qi, Xin; Liu, Ruo Dan; Zhang, Zi Fang; Cui, Jing] Zhengzhou Univ, Coll Med, Dept Parasitol, Zhengzhou 450052, Henan, Peoples R China","Liu, LN (reprint author), Zhengzhou Univ, Coll Med, Dept Parasitol, Zhengzhou 450052, Henan, Peoples R China.",wangzq@zzu.edu.cn; cuij@zzu.edu.cn,,,National Natural Science Foundation of China [81172612]; Henan Medical Science and Technology [201401001],"This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (grant no. 81172612) and the major project of Henan Medical Science and Technology (no. 201401001).

Cardiac involvement is the most prominent manifestation, as 30% of infected subjects will develop abnormal ventricular repolarization with myocarditis, fibrosis and cardiomyocyte hypertrophy by undefined mechanisms. Nevertheless, follow-up studies in chagasic patients, as well as studies with murine models, suggest that the intensity of clinical symptoms and pathophysiological events that occur during the acute phase of disease are associated with the severity of cardiac disease observed during the chronic phase. In the present study we investigated the role of microRNAs (miRNAs) in the disease progression in response to T. cruzi infection, as alterations in miRNA levels are known to be associated with many cardiovascular disorders. We screened 641 rodent miRNAs in heart samples of mice during an acute infection with the Colombiana T.cruzi strain and identified multiple miRNAs significantly altered upon infection. Seventeen miRNAs were found significantly deregulated in all three analyzed time points post infection. Among these, six miRNAs had their expression correlated with clinical parameters relevant to the disease, such as parasitemia and maximal heart rate-corrected QT (QTc) interval. Computational analyses identified that the gene targets for these six miRNAs were involved in networks and signaling pathways related to increased ventricular depolarization and repolarization times, important factors for QTc interval prolongation. The data presented here will guide further studies about the contribution of microRNAs to Chagas heart disease pathogenesis.","[Navarro, Isabela Cunha; Ferreira, Frederico Moraes; Baron, Monique Andrade; Kalil, Jorge; Cunha-Neto, Edecio; Pinto Ferreira, Ludmila Rodrigues] Univ Sao Paulo, Heart Inst InCor, Immunol Lab, Sch Med, Sao Paulo, Brazil; [Navarro, Isabela Cunha; Ferreira, Frederico Moraes; Baron, Monique Andrade; Kalil, Jorge; Cunha-Neto, Edecio; Pinto Ferreira, Ludmila Rodrigues] Univ Sao Paulo, Sch Med, Div Clin Immunol & Allergy, Sao Paulo, Brazil; [Navarro, Isabela Cunha; Ferreira, Frederico Moraes; Baron, Monique Andrade; Kalil, Jorge; Cunha-Neto, Edecio; Pinto Ferreira, Ludmila Rodrigues] Iii INCT, Inst Investigat Immunol, Sao Paulo, Brazil; [Nakaya, Helder I.] Univ Sao Paulo, Dept Clin Anal & Toxicol, Sch Pharmaceut Sci, Sao Paulo, Brazil; [Vilar-Pereira, Glaucia; Pereira, Isabela Resende; Lannes-Vieira, Joseli] Fiocruz MS, Inst Oswaldo Cruz, Lab Biol Interact, BR-21045900 Rio De Janeiro, Brazil; [Goncalves Silva, Ana Maria; De Brito, Thales] Univ Sao Paulo, Inst Trop Med, Sao Paulo, Brazil; [Goncalves Silva, Ana Maria; De Brito, Thales] Univ Sao Paulo, Sch Med, Dept Pathol, Sao Paulo, Brazil; [Real, Juliana Monte] Hosp Sirio Libanes, Sao Paulo, Brazil; [Chevillard, Christophe] Aix Marseille Univ, Fac Med, INSERM, U906, Marseille, France","Navarro, IC (reprint author), Univ Sao Paulo, Heart Inst InCor, Immunol Lab, Sch Med, Sao Paulo, Brazil.",edecunha@gmail.com,"Ferreira, Ludmila Rodrigues Pinto/B-4955-2015; Ferreira, Frederico/A-4622-2013; De Brito, Thales/L-2865-2017; Ferreira, Ludmila/C-4100-2012; Cunha-Neto, Edecio/B-4157-2009; chevillard, christophe/A-7087-2015; KALIL, JORGE/C-8029-2012; Navarro, Isabela Cunha/V-7182-2017; Nakaya, Helder/A-1397-2010","Ferreira, Ludmila Rodrigues Pinto/0000-0001-9944-6691; De Brito, Thales/0000-0003-1106-7254; Ferreira, Ludmila/0000-0001-9944-6691; Cunha-Neto, Edecio/0000-0002-3699-3345; chevillard, christophe/0000-0002-5269-8813; KALIL, JORGE/0000-0001-8415-4274; Navarro, Isabela Cunha/0000-0002-6844-2361; Nakaya, Helder/0000-0001-5297-9108","Sao Paulo state Foundation for Scientific Research (FAPESP) [2012/08107-6, 2013/50302-3]; Brazilian National Research Council (CNPq); National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease [1P50AI098461-01]; CNPq fellowship [151045/2013-5]; FAPESP fellowship; Rio de Janeiro Foundation for Scientific Research (FAPERJ); Medical Investigation Laboratory; CNPq [474234/20126-Universal, 302534/2008-3]; FAPERJ [APQ1-E-26/111.756/2008, CNE/E-26/101.549/2010, E-26/110.153/2013, E-26/111.709/2013]; National Institute for Science and Technology for Vaccines (INCTV/CNPq) [403979/2012-9-DECIT]; Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale (INSERM)","This work has been supported by grants of Sao Paulo state Foundation for Scientific Research (FAPESP) - Grants number 2012/08107-6 and 2013/50302-3 - the Brazilian National Research Council (CNPq), National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease - Grant Number 1P50AI098461-01.

A common view among the scientific community and public health officers is that heavy rainfalls have a flushing effect on breeding sites, which negatively affects vector populations, thereby diminishing disease transmission. During 2014 in Montpellier, France, there were at least 11 autochthonous cases of chikungunya caused by the invasive tiger mosquito Aedes albopictus in the vicinity of an imported case. We show that an extreme rainfall event increased and extended the abundance of the disease vector Ae. albopictus, hence the period of autochthonous transmission of chikungunya. Methodology/Principal Findings We report results from close monitoring of the adult and egg population of the chikungunya vector Ae. albopictus through weekly sampling over the entire mosquito breeding season, which revealed an unexpected pattern. Statistical analysis of the seasonal dynamics of female abundance in relation to climatic factors showed that these relationships changed after the heavy rainfall event. Before the inundations, accumulated temperatures are the most important variable predicting Ae. albopictus seasonal dynamics. However, after the inundations, accumulated rainfall over the 4 weeks prior to capture predicts the seasonal dynamics of this species and extension of the transmission period. Conclusions/Significance Our empirical data suggests that heavy rainfall events did increase the risk of arbovirus transmission in Southern France in 2014 by favouring a rapid rise in abundance of vector mosquitoes. Further studies should now confirm these results in different ecologicalcontexts, so that the impact of global change and extreme climatic events on mosquito population dynamics and the risk of disease transmission can be adequately understood.","[Roiz, David; Bousses, Philippe; Simard, Frederic; Paupy, Christophe; Fontenille, Didier] MIVEGEC Infect Dis & Vectors Ecol Genet Evolut &, Inst Rech Dev, UMR UM IRD224 CNRS5290, Montpellier, France; [Fontenille, Didier] Inst Pasteur Cambodge, Phnom Penh, Cambodia","Roiz, D (reprint author), MIVEGEC Infect Dis & Vectors Ecol Genet Evolut &, Inst Rech Dev, UMR UM IRD224 CNRS5290, BP 64501, Montpellier, France.",davidroiz@gmail.com,"SIMARD, Frederic/J-9489-2016; Roiz, David/F-2082-2011; Paupy, Christophe/I-4847-2017","SIMARD, Frederic/0000-0002-2871-5329; Roiz, David/0000-0002-5819-3648; Paupy, Christophe/0000-0002-7122-2079","ERA-Net BiodivERsA, France [ANR-13-EBID-0007-01]; FWF, Austria [I-1434]; DFG,Germany [KL2087/6-1]; BiodivERsA","This work was funded by the ERA-Net BiodivERsA, project CG-INVAMOFECT with the national funders ANR-13-EBID-0007-01 France, FWF I-1434 Austria, and DFG KL2087/6-1 Germany as part of the 2012-2013 BiodivERsA call for research proposals.

CHIKV causes chikungunya fever (CHIK), a syndrome characterized by rash, fever, and debilitating, often chronic arthritis. In recent outbreaks, CHIKV has been recognized to manifest more neurologic signs of illness in the elderly and those with co-morbidities. The syndrome caused by CHIKV is often self-limited; however, many patients develop persistent arthralgia that can last for months or years. These characteristics make CHIKV not only important from a human health standpoint, but also from an economic standpoint. Despite its importance as a reemerging disease, there is no licensed vaccine or specific treatment to prevent CHIK. Many studies have begun to elucidate the pathogenesis of CHIKF and the mechanism of persistent arthralgia, including the role of the adaptive immune response, which is still poorly understood. In addition, the lack of an animal model for chronic infection has limited studies of CHIKV pathogenesis as well as the ability to assess the safety of vaccine candidates currently under development. To address this deficiency, we used recombination activating gene 1 (RAG1(-/-)) knockout mice, which are deficient in both T and B lymphocytes, to develop a chronic CHIKV infection model. Here, we describe this model as well as its use in evaluating the safety of a live-attenuated vaccine candidate.","[Seymour, Robert L.; Adams, A. Paige; Leal, Grace; Alcorn, Maria D.

Under the leadership of the World Health Organization (WHO), a large coalition of stakeholders is now committed to achieving this goal. A roadmap has been laid out, and indicators and milestones have been defined to monitor the progress of the elimination of g-HAT as a public health problem by 2020. Subsequently, a more ambitious objective was set for 2030: to stop disease transmission. This paper provides a situational update to 2012 for a number of indicators of elimination: number of cases annually reported, geographic distribution of the disease and areas and populations at different levels of risk. Results Comparing the 5-year periods 2003-2007 and 2008-2012, the area at high or very high risk of g-HAT shrank by 60%, while the area at moderate risk decreased by 22%. These are the areas where g-HAT is still to be considered a public health problem (i.e. > 1 HAT reported case per 10,000 people per annum). This contraction of at-risk areas corresponds to a reduction of 57% for the population at high or very high risk (from 4.1 to 1.8 million), and 20% for moderate risk (from 14.0 to 11.3 million). Discussion Improved data completeness and accuracy of the Atlas of HAT enhanced our capacity to monitor the progress towards the elimination of g-HAT. The trends in the selected indicators suggest that, in recent years, progress has been steady and in line with the elimination goal laid out in the WHO roadmap on neglected tropical diseases.","[Simarro, Pere P.; Franco, Jose R.; Priotto, Gerardo; Jannin, Jean G.] WHO, Control Neglected Trop Dis Innovat & Intensified, CH-1211 Geneva, Switzerland; [Cecchi, Giuliano] Food & Agr Org United Nations, Subreg Off Eastern Africa, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia; [Paone, Massimo; Mattioli, Raffaele C.] Food & Agr Org United Nations, Anim Prod & Hlth Div, Rome, Italy; [Diarra, Abdoulaye] WHO, Reg Off Africa, Intercountry Support Team, Libreville, Gabon","Franco, JR (reprint author), WHO, Control Neglected Trop Dis Innovat & Intensified, CH-1211 Geneva, Switzerland.",francoj@who.int,,,Government of Italy through FAO Trust Fund for Food Security and Food Safety [GTFS/RAF/474/ITA],The authors received no specific funding for this work.

Individuals may be co-infected, raising the possibility of important interactions between these two pathogens with consequences for LF elimination through annual mass drug administration (MDA). Methodology and Principal Findings We analysed circulating filarial antigenaemia (CFA) by HIV infection status among adults in two sites in northern Malawi, a region endemic for both LF and HIV. Stored blood samples and data from two geographically separate studies were used: one a recruitment phase of a clinical trial of anti-filarial agent dosing regimens, and the other a whole population annual HIV sero-survey. In study one, 1,851 consecutive adult volunteers were screened for HIV and LF infection. CFA prevalence was 25.4% (43/169) in HIV-positive and 23.6% (351/1487) in HIV-negative participants (p=0.57). Geometric mean CFA concentrations were 859 and 1660 antigen units per ml of blood (Ag/ml) respectively, geometric mean ratio (GMR) 0.85, 95% CI 0.49-1.50. In 7,863 adults in study two, CFA prevalence was 20.9% (86/411) in HIV-positive and 24.0% (1789/7452) in HIV-negative participants (p=0.15). Geometric mean CFA concentrations were 630 and 839 Ag/ml respectively (GMR 0.75, 95% CI 0.60-0.94). In the HIV-positive group, antiretroviral therapy (ART) use was associated with a lower CFA prevalence, 12.7%(18/142) vs. 25.3%(67/265), (OR 0.43, 95% CI 0.24-0.76). Prevalence of CFA decreased with duration of ART use, 15.2% 0-1 year (n=59), 13.6% > 1-2 years (n=44), 10.0% > 2-3 years (n=30) and 0% > 3-4 years treatment (n=9), p<0.01 x(2) for linear trend. Conclusions/Significance In this large cross-sectional study of two distinct LF-exposed populations, there is no evidence that HIV infection has an impact on LF epidemiology that will interfere with LF control measures. A significant association of ART use with lower CFA prevalence merits further investigation to understand this apparent beneficial impact of ART.","[Tafatatha, Terence; Ngwira, Bagrey; Phiri, Amos; Kondowe, Mariot; Piston, Wilson; Molesworth, Anna; Kayuni, Ndoliwe; Koole, Olivier; Crampin, Amelia; French, Neil] Karonga Prevent Study, Karonga Dist, Malawi; [Tafatatha, Terence] Univ Liverpool, Liverpool Sch Trop Med, Ctr Neglected Trop Dis, Liverpool L3 5QA, Merseyside, England; [Taegtmeyer, Miriam] Univ Liverpool, Liverpool Sch Trop Med, Dept Int Publ Hlth, Liverpool L3 5QA, Merseyside, England; [Ngwira, Bagrey; Molesworth, Anna; Koole, Olivier; Crampin, Amelia] London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, London WC1, England; [Horton, John] Trop Projects, Hitchin, Herts, England; [French, Neil] Univ Liverpool, Inst Infect & Global Hlth, Liverpool L69 3BX, Merseyside, England","Tafatatha, T (reprint author), Karonga Prevent Study, Karonga Dist, Malawi.",ttafatatha@yahoo.com,,"Crampin, Amelia/0000-0002-1513-4330; French, Neil/0000-0003-4814-8293","Task Force for Child Survival, Emory University [43922]; Wellcome Trust [079828/Z/06/Z]; Centre for Neglected Tropical Diseases (CNTD); Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine; Department for International Development","Study 1 was supported by an award from the Task Force for Child Survival, Emory University (Grant No 43922) and Study 2 was supported by a grant from The Wellcome Trust (Grant No 079828/Z/06/Z).

In tropical Africa, changes in land use and proximity to water have been associated with the disease. This study presents the first analysis of BU at the village level in southwestern Ghana, where prevalence rates are among the highest globally, and explores fine and medium-scale associations with land cover by comparing patterns both within BU clusters and surrounding landscapes. Methodology/Principal Findings We obtained 339 hospital-confirmed BU cases in southwestern Ghana between 2007 and 2010. The clusters of BU were identified using spatial scan statistics and the percentages of six land cover classes were calculated based on Landsat and Rapid Eye imagery for each of 154 villages/towns. The association between BU prevalence and each land cover class was calculated using negative binomial regression models. We found that older people had a significantly higher risk for BU after considering population age structure. BU cases were positively associated with the higher percentage of water and grassland surrounding each village, but negatively associated with the percent of urban. The results also showed that BU was clustered in areas with high percentage of mining activity, suggesting that water and mining play an important and potentially interactive role in BU occurrence. Conclusions/Significance Our study highlights the importance of multiple land use changes along the Offin River, particularly mining and agriculture, which might be associated with BU disease in southwestern Ghana. Our study is the first to use both medium- and high-resolution imagery to assess these changes. We also show that older populations (>= 60 y) appear to be at higher risk of BU disease than children, once BU data were weighted by population age structures.","[Wu, Jianyong; Tschakert, Petra; Ricciardi, Vincent; Smithwick, Erica A.

Oncomelania hupensis is the unique intermediate host of schistosoma japonicum, and its change influences the distribution of S. japonica. The Three Gorges Dam (TGD) has substantially changed the ecology and environment in the Dongting Lake region. This study investigated the impact of water level and elevation on the survival and habitat of the snails. Methods Data were collected for 16 bottomlands around 4 hydrological stations, which included water, density of living snails (form the Anxiang Station for Schistosomiasis Control) and elevation (from Google Earth). Based on the elevation, sixteen bottomlands were divided into 3 groups. ARIMA models were built to predict the density of living snails in different elevation areas. Results Before closure of TGD, 7 out of 9 years had a water level beyond the warning level at least once at Anxiang hydrological tation, compared with only 3 out of 10 years after closure of TGD. There were two severe droughts that happened in 2006 and 2011, with much fewer number of flooding per year compared with other study years. Overall, there was a correlation between water level changing and density of living snails variation in all the elevations areas. The density of living snails in all elevations areas was decreasing after the TGD was built. The relationship between number of flooding per year and the density of living snails was more pronounced in the medium and high elevation areas; the density of living snails kept decreasing from 2003 to 2014. In low elevation area however, the density of living snails decreased after 2003 first and turned to increase after 2011. Our ARIMA prediction models indicated that the snails would not disappear in the Dongting Lake region in the next 7 years. In the low elevation area, the density of living snails would increase slightly, and then stabilize after the year 2017. In the medium elevation region, the change of the density of living snails would be more obvious and would increase till the year 2020. In the high elevation area, the density of living snails would remain stable after the year 2015. Conclusion The TGD influenced water levels and reduced the risk of flooding and the density of living snails in the study region. Based on our prediction models, the density of living snails in all elevations tends to be stabilized. Control of S. japonica would continue to be an important task in the study area in the coming decade.","[Wu, Jin-Yi; Zhou, Yi-Biao; Li, Lin-Han; Zheng, Sheng-Bang; Song, Xiu-Xia; Jiang, Qing-Wu] Fudan Univ, Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Epidemiol, Shanghai 200433, Peoples R China; [Wu, Jin-Yi; Zhou, Yi-Biao; Li, Lin-Han; Zheng, Sheng-Bang; Song, Xiu-Xia; Jiang, Qing-Wu] Fudan Univ, Minist Educ, Key Lab Publ Hlth Safety, Shanghai 200433, Peoples R China; [Wu, Jin-Yi; Zhou, Yi-Biao; Li, Lin-Han; Zheng, Sheng-Bang; Song, Xiu-Xia; Jiang, Qing-Wu] Fudan Univ, Ctr Trop Dis Res, Shanghai 200433, Peoples R China; [Chen, Yue] Univ Ottawa, Fac Med, Sch Epidemiol Publ Hlth & Prevent Med, Ottawa, ON, Canada; [Liang, Song] Univ Florida, Coll Publ Hlth & Hlth Profess, Dept Environm & Global Hlth, Gainesville, FL USA; [Liang, Song] Univ Florida, Emerging Pathogens Inst, Gainesville, FL USA; [Zhu, Shao-ping] Anxiang Off Leading Grp Schistosomiasis Control, Changde, Hunan, Peoples R China; [Ren, Guang-Hui] Hunan Inst Schistosomiasis Control, Yueyang, Hunan, Peoples R China","Wu, JY (reprint author), Fudan Univ, Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Epidemiol, Shanghai 200433, Peoples R China.",z_yibiao@hotmail.com,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China [30872159]; National Science & Technique Major Program [2012ZX10004-220, 2008ZX10004-011]","This work is supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant number: 30872159, http://www.nsfc.gov.cn/, YZ) and the National Science & Technique Major Program (Grant number: 2012ZX10004-220 and 2008ZX10004-011, http://www.nmp.gov.cn/, YZ).

Wolbachia pipientis, an obligate intracellular bacterium, is being developed as a bio-control strategy against dengue because it limits replication of the virus in the mosquito. The Wolbachia strain wMel, which has been introduced into the mosquito vector, Aedes aegypti, has been shown to invade and spread to near fixation in field releases. Standard measures of Wolbachia's efficacy for blocking virus replication focus on the detection and quantification of virus in mosquito tissues. Examining the saliva provides a more accurate measure of transmission potential and can reveal the extrinsic incubation period (EIP), that is, the time it takes virus to arrive in the saliva following the consumption of DENV viremic blood. EIP is a key determinant of a mosquito's ability to transmit DENVs, as the earlier the virus appears in the saliva the more opportunities the mosquito will have to infect humans on subsequent bites. Methodology/Principal Findings We used a non-destructive assay to repeatedly quantify DENV in saliva from wMel-infected and Wolbachia-free wild-type control mosquitoes following the consumption of a DENV-infected blood meal. We show that wMel lengthens the EIP, reduces the frequency at which the virus is expectorated and decreases the dengue copy number in mosquito saliva as compared to wild-type mosquitoes. These observations can at least be partially explained by an overall reduction in saliva produced by wMel mosquitoes. More generally, we found that the concentration of DENV in a blood meal is a determinant of the length of EIP, saliva virus titer and mosquito survival. Conclusions/Significance The saliva-based traits reported here offer more disease-relevant measures of Wolbachia's effects on the vector and the virus. The lengthening of EIP highlights another means, in addition to the reduction of infection frequencies and DENV titers in mosquitoes, by which Wolbachia should operate to reduce DENV transmission in the field.","[Ye, Yixin H.; Carrasco, Alison M.; O'Neill, Scott L.; McGraw, Elizabeth A.] Monash Univ, Sch Biol Sci, Clayton, Vic, Australia; [Frentiu, Francesca D.] Queensland Univ Technol, Inst Hlth & Biomed Innovat, Kelvin Grove, Qld, Australia; [Frentiu, Francesca D.] Queensland Univ Technol, Sch Biomed Sci, Kelvin Grove, Qld, Australia; [Chenoweth, Stephen F.; Beebe, Nigel W.] Univ Queensland, Sch Biol Sci, St Lucia, Qld, Australia; [Beebe, Nigel W.] CSIRO Biosecur Flagship, Ecosci Precinct, Dutton Pk, Qld, Australia; [van den Hurk, Andrew F.] Queensland Govt, Virol Publ & Environm Hlth Serv, Coopers Plains, Qld, Australia; [van den Hurk, Andrew F.] Queensland Govt, Forens & Sci Serv, Coopers Plains, Qld, Australia; [Simmons, Cameron P.] Univ Melbourne, Nossal Inst Global Hlth, Parkville, Vic 3052, Australia; [Simmons, Cameron P.] Univ Oxford, Clin Res Unit, Hosp Trop Dis, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam; [Simmons, Cameron P.] Univ Oxford, Churchill Hosp, Ctr Trop Med, Oxford, England","Ye, YXH (reprint author), Monash Univ, Sch Biol Sci, Clayton, Vic, Australia.",beth.mcgraw@monash.edu,"Beebe, Nigel/C-5610-2008; Chenoweth, Stephen/A-7211-2012; O'Neill, Scott/B-3568-2009; O'Neill, Scott/R-9560-2019","Beebe, Nigel/0000-0003-2877-0691; Chenoweth, Stephen/0000-0002-8303-9159; O'Neill, Scott/0000-0002-4131-3615; O'Neill, Scott/0000-0002-4131-3615; Frentiu, Francesca/0000-0001-8628-4216; Simmons, Cameron P./0000-0002-9039-7392","Foundation for the National Institutes of Health through Grand Challenges in Global Health Initiative of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation [FNIH55]; National Health and Medical Research Council of Australia [APP1020607, APP1037003]","This research was supported by the Foundation for the National Institutes of Health through the Grand Challenges in Global Health Initiative of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation (FNIH55) and by a Project (APP1020607) and a Program grant (APP1037003) from the National Health and Medical Research Council of Australia.

Significant research in southern Peru has been conducted to understand T. cruzi infection and vector control, however, much less is known about the burden of infection and epidemiology in northern Peru. Methodology A cross-sectional study was conducted to estimate the seroprevalence of T. cruzi infection in humans (n=611) and domestic animals [dogs (n=106) and guinea pigs (n=206)] in communities of Cutervo Province, Peru. Sampling and diagnostic strategies differed according to species. An entomological household study (n=208) was conducted to identify the triatomine burden and species composition, as well as the prevalence of T. cruzi in vectors. Electrocardiograms (EKG) were performed on a subset of participants (n=90 T. cruzi infected participants and 170 age and sex-matched controls). The seroprevalence of T. cruzi among humans, dogs, and guinea pigs was 14.9%(95% CI: 12.2 -18.0%), 19.8% (95% CI: 12.728.7%) and 3.3% (95% CI: 1.4 -6.9%) respectively. In one community, the prevalence of T. cruzi infection was 17.2% (95% CI: 9.6 -24.7%) among participants < 15 years, suggesting recent transmission. Increasing age, positive triatomines in a participant's house, and ownership of a T. cruzi positive guinea pig were independent correlates of T. cruzi infection. Only one species of triatomine was found, Panstrongylus lignarius, formerly P. herreri. Approximately forty percent (39.9%, 95% CI: 33.2 - 46.9%) of surveyed households were infested with this vector and 14.9% (95% CI: 10.4 - 20.5%) had at least one triatomine positive for T. cruzi. The cardiac abnormality of right bundle branch block was rare, but only identified in seropositive individuals. Conclusions Our research documents a substantial prevalence of T. cruzi infection in Cutervo and highlights a need for greater attention and vector control efforts in northern Peru.","[Alroy, Karen A.] Natl Sci Fdn, AAAS Sci & Technol Policy Fellow, Div Environm Biol, Arlington, VA 22230 USA; [Alroy, Karen A.; Gilman, Robert H.; Marks, Morgan A.; Hillyard, Miranda; Vidal, Elisa] Johns Hopkins Univ, Bloomberg Sch Publ Hlth, Baltimore, MD USA; [Huang, Christine] Univ Arizona, Dept Pediat, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA; [Huang, Christine] Univ Arizona, Dept Emergency Med, Tucson, AZ USA; [Gilman, Robert H.; Quispe-Machaca, Victor R.; Ancca-Juarez, Jenny; Verastegui, Manuela; Sanchez, Gerardo; Cabrera, Lilia; Naquira, Cesar; Levy, Michael Z.] Univ Peruana Cayetano Heredia, Urbanizac Ingn, Fac Sci & Philosophy Alberto Cazorla Talleri, Lima, Peru; [Billig, Erica M.

This case-control study enrolled 131 serologically-diagnosed Chagas disease patients (59 men and 72 women, mean age of 60.4 +/- 9.8 years) treated at the University Hospital of Londrina and the Chagas Disease Laboratory of the State University of Maringa. A control group was formed of 165 healthy individuals - spouses of patients or blood donors from the Regional Blood Bank in Maringa (84 men and 81 women, with a mean age of 59.0 +/- 11.4 years). Genotyping of HLA and KIR was performed by PCR-SSOP. KIR2DS2-C1 in the absence of KIR2DL2 (KIR2DS2(+)/2DL2(-)/C1(+)) was more frequent in Chagas patients (P = 0.020; Pc = 0.040; OR = 2.14) and, in particular, those who manifested chronic chagasic cardiopathy-CCC (P = 0.0002; Pc = 0.0004; OR = 6.64; 95% CI = 2.30-18.60) when compared to the control group, and when CCC group was compared to the patients without heart involvement (P = 0.010; Pc = 0.020; OR = 3.97). The combination pair KIR2DS2(+)/2DL2(-)/KIR2DL3(+)/C1(+) was also positively associated with chronic chagasic cardiopathy. KIR2DL2 and KIR2DS2 were related to immunopathogenesis in Chagas disease. The combination of KIR2DS2 activating receptor with C1 ligand, in the absence of KIR2DL2, may be related to a risk factor in the chronic Chagas disease and chronic chagasic cardiopathy.","[Ayo, Christiane Maria; Reis, Pamela Guimaraes; Oliveira, Camila de Freitas] Univ Estadual Maringa, Dept Anal Clin & Biomed, Post Grad Program Biosci Appl Pharm, Maringa, Parana, Brazil; [de Oliveira Dalalio, Marcia Machado; Laguila Visentainer, Jeane Eliete; de Araujo, Silvana Marques; Sell, Ana Maria] Univ Estadual Maringa, Basic Hlth Sci, Maringa, Parana, Brazil; [de Oliveira Marques, Divina Seila] Univ Estadual Londrina, Dept Clin Med, Londrina, Parana, Brazil","Ayo, CM (reprint author), Univ Estadual Maringa, Dept Anal Clin & Biomed, Post Grad Program Biosci Appl Pharm, Maringa, Parana, Brazil.",anamsell@gmail.com,"ayo, christiane/B-5448-2017; visentainer, jeane/B-3510-2009","visentainer, jeane/0000-0002-5815-7903",Fundacao Araucaria; CAPES-Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior,"MMdOD was supported by Fundacao Araucaria - http://www.fappr.pr.gov.br/.

We investigated progressive scarring and its relationship to conjunctival infection, inflammation and transcript levels of cytokines and fibrogenic factors. Methodology/Principal Findings We recruited two cohorts, one each in Ethiopia and Tanzania, of individuals with established trachomatous conjunctival scarring. They were followed six-monthly for two years, with clinical examinations and conjunctival swab sample collection. Progressive scarring cases were identified by comparing baseline and two-year photographs, and compared to individuals without progression. Samples were tested for C. trachomatis by PCR and transcript levels of S100A7, IL1B, IL13, IL17A, CXCL5, CTGF, SPARCL1, CEACAM5, MMP7, MMP9 and CD83 were estimated by quantitative RT-PCR. Progressive scarring was found in 135/585 (23.1%) of Ethiopian participants and 173/577 (30.0%) of Tanzanian participants. There was a strong relationship between progressive scarring and increasing inflammatory episodes (Ethiopia: OR 5.93, 95% CI 3.31-10.6, p<0.0001. Tanzania: OR 5.76, 95% CI 2.60-12.7, p<0.0001). No episodes of C. trachomatis infection were detected in the Ethiopian cohort and only 5 episodes in the Tanzanian cohort. Clinical inflammation, but not scarring progression, was associated with increased expression of S100A7, IL1B, IL17A, CXCL5, CTGF, CEACAM5, MMP7, CD83 and reduced SPARCL1. Conclusions/Significance Scarring progressed in the absence of detectable C. trachomatis, which raises uncertainty about the primary drivers of late-stage trachoma. Chronic conjunctival inflammation appears to be central and is associated with enriched expression of pro-inflammatory factors and altered expression of extracellular matrix regulators. Host determinants of scarring progression appear more complex and subtle than the features of inflammation. Overall this indicates a potential role for anti-inflammatory interventions to interrupt progression and the need for trichiasis disease surveillance and surgery long after chlamydial infection has been controlled at community level.","[Burton, Matthew J.; Rajak, Saul N.; Hu, Victor H.; Ramadhani, Athumani; Habtamu, Esmael; Mabey, David C.

This disease has two phases, acute and chronic. The acute phase is often asymptomatic, but with time it progresses to the chronic phase, affecting the heart and gastrointestinal tract and can be lethal. Chronic Chagas cardiomyopathy involves an inflammatory vasculopathy. Endothelial activation during Chagas disease entails the expression of cell adhesion molecules such as E-selectin, vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) and intercellular cell adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) through a mechanism involving NF-kappa B activation. Currently, specific trypanocidal therapy remains on benznidazole, although new triazole derivatives are promising. A novel strategy is proposed that aims at some pathophysiological processes to facilitate current antiparasitic therapy, decreasing treatment length or doses and slowing disease progress. Simvastatin has anti-inflammatory actions, including improvement of endothelial function, by inducing a novel pro-resolving lipid, the 5-lypoxygenase derivative 15-epi-lipoxin A4 (15-epi-LXA4), which belongs to aspirin-triggered lipoxins. Herein, we propose modifying endothelial activation with simvastatin or benznidazole and evaluate the pathways involved, including induction of 15-epi-LXA4. The effect of 5 mu M simvastatin or 20 mu M benznidazole upon endothelial activation was assessed in EA.hy926 or HUVEC cells, by E-selectin, ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 expression. 15-epi-LXA4 production and the relationship of both drugs with the NF kappa B pathway, as measured by IKK-IKB phosphorylation and nuclear migration of p65 protein was also assayed. Both drugs were administered to cell cultures 16 hours before the infection with T. cruzi parasites. Indeed, 5 mu M simvastatin as well as 20 mu M benznidazole prevented the increase in E-selectin, ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 expression in T. cruzi-infected endothelial cells by decreasing the NF-kappa B pathway. In conclusion, Simvastatin and benznidazole prevent endothelial activation induced by T. cruzi infection, and the effect of simvastatin is mediated by the inhibition of the NF kappa B pathway by inducing 15-epi-LXA4 production.","[Campos-Estrada, Carolina; Gonzalez-Herrera, Fabiola; Lapier, Michel; Pesce, Barbara; Ferreira, Jorge; Lopez-Munoz, Rodrigo; Maya, Juan D.] Univ Chile, Fac Med, Mol & Clin Pharmacol Program, Biomed Sci Inst ICBM, Santiago 7, Chile; [Liempi, Ana; Kemmerling, Ulrike] Univ Chile, Fac Med, Biomed Sci Inst ICBM, Anat & Dev Biol Program, Santiago 7, Chile; [Lopez-Munoz, Rodrigo] Univ Austral Chile, Fac Ciencias Vet, Inst Farmacol & Morfofisiol, Valdivia, Chile","Campos-Estrada, C (reprint author), Univ Chile, Fac Med, Mol & Clin Pharmacol Program, Biomed Sci Inst ICBM, Santiago 7, Chile.",jmaya@med.uchile.cl,"Lopez-Munoz, Rodrigo/I-1097-2013; Maya, Juan/H-9561-2013; Kemmerling, Ulrike/H-8783-2013","Lopez-Munoz, Rodrigo/0000-0003-1825-8563; Maya, Juan/0000-0003-3934-6319; Kemmerling, Ulrike/0000-0002-0201-1665","Fondo Nacional de Desarrollo Cientifico y Tecnologico de Chile [1130189, 1120230, 1130772]; Fondo de Equipamiento Cientifico y Tecnologico [EQM130116]","Research reported in this publication was supported by Fondo Nacional de Desarrollo Cientifico y Tecnologico de Chile, grants numbers 1130189 (to JDM), 1120230 (to UK), AND 1130772 (to JF). http://www.conicyt.cl/fondecyt/, and from Fondo de Equipamiento Cientifico y Tecnologico, grant number EQM130116 (to JDM and UK). http://www.conicyt.cl/fondequip/.

In each patch the submodel consists of susceptible, exposed, infectious, and vaccinated subpopulations of both dogs and humans and describes the spread of rabies among dogs and from infectious dogs to humans. The existence of the disease-free equilibrium is discussed, the basic reproduction number is calculated, and the effect of moving rates of dogs between patches on the basic reproduction number is studied. To investigate the rabies virus clades lineages, the two-patch submodel is used to simulate the human rabies data from Guizhou and Guangxi, Hebei and Fujian, and Sichuan and Shaanxi, respectively. It is found that the basic reproduction number of the two-patch model could be larger than one even if the isolated basic reproduction number of each patch is less than one. This indicates that the immigration of dogs may make the disease endemic even if the disease dies out in each isolated patch when there is no immigration. In order to reduce and prevent geographical spread of rabies in China, our results suggest that the management of dog markets and trades needs to be regulated, and transportation of dogs has to be better monitored and under constant surveillance.","[Chen, Jing; Ruan, Shigui] Univ Miami, Dept Math, Coral Gables, FL 33124 USA; [Zou, Lan] Sichuan Univ, Dept Math, Chengdu 610064, Sichuan, Peoples R China; [Jin, Zhen] Shanxi Univ, Complex Syst Res Ctr, Taiyuan 030006, Shanxi, Peoples R China","Chen, J (reprint author), Univ Miami, Dept Math, Coral Gables, FL 33124 USA.",ruan@math.miami.edu,"jin, zhen/B-6563-2015","jin, zhen/0000-0002-9763-707X","National Natural Science Foundation of China [11171314, 11331009, 11201321, 11228104]; NSF [DMS-1412454]","Research was supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China under grants No. 11171314, No. 11331009, No. 11201321 and No. 11228104, and by NSF grant DMS-1412454.

Despite their importance, there are few reports on the epidemiology of these diseases in Tanzania, and the true burden of such illnesses remains unknown. This study aimed to identify the prevalence of leptospirosis, brucellosis, typhoid fever and urinary tract infections and their rate of co-infections with malaria. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted at Kilosa district hospital in Tanzania for 6 months. Febrile children aged from 2-13 years were recruited from the outpatient department. Patients were screened by serological tests such as IgM and IgG ELISA, and microscopic agglutination test. Results A total of 370 patients were enrolled; of these 85 (23.0%) had malaria parasites, 43 (11.6%) had presumptive acute leptospirosis and 26/200 (13%) had confirmed leptospirosis. Presumptive acute brucellosis due to B. abortus was identified among 26 (7.0%) of patients while B. melitensis was detected in 57 (15.4%) of the enrolled patients. Presumptive typhoid fever due to S. Typhi was identified in thirty eight (10.3%) of the participants and 69 (18.6%) had urinary tract infections. Patients presented with similar symptoms; therefore, the identification of these diseases could not be done based on clinical ground alone. Co-infections between malaria and bacterial febrile illnesses were observed in 146 patients (39.5%). Although antibacterials and/or anti-malarials were prescribed in most patients, some patients did not receive the appropriate treatment. Conclusion The study has underscored the importance of febrile bacterial diseases including zoonoses such as leptospirosis and brucellosis in febrile children, and thus such illnesses should be considered by clinicians in the differential diagnoses of febrile diseases. However, access to diagnostic tests for discrimination of febrile illnesses is needed. This would allow febrile patients to receive the correct diagnoses and facilitation of accurate and prompt treatment.","[Chipwaza, Beatrice; Gwakisa, Paul S.] Nelson Mandela African Inst Sci & Technol, Arusha, Tanzania; [Chipwaza, Beatrice] Ifakara Hlth Inst, Ifakara, Tanzania; [Mhamphi, Ginethon G.] Sokoine Univ Agr, Ctr Pest Management, Morogoro, Tanzania; [Ngatunga, Steve D.] Natl Inst Med Res, Morogoro, Tanzania; [Selemani, Majige] Ifakara Hlth Inst, Dar Es Salaam, Tanzania; [Amuri, Mbaraka] Jhpiego, Dar Es Salaam, Tanzania; [Mugasa, Joseph P.] Amani Med Res Ctr, Natl Inst Med Res, Tanga, Tanzania; [Gwakisa, Paul S.] Sokoine Univ Agr, Genome Sci Ctr, Morogoro, Tanzania; [Gwakisa, Paul S.] Sokoine Univ Agr, Dept Vet Microbiol & Parasitol, Morogoro, Tanzania","Chipwaza, B (reprint author), Nelson Mandela African Inst Sci & Technol, Arusha, Tanzania.",bchipwaza@ihi.or.tz,"AMURI, Mbaraka/C-5386-2011","AMURI, Mbaraka/0000-0002-8583-9555",Tanzania Commission for Science and Technology (COSTECH) through the Nelson Mandela African Institute of Science and Technology in Arusha Tanzania; Ifakara Health Institute,"This work was funded by the Tanzania Commission for Science and Technology (COSTECH) through the Nelson Mandela African Institute of Science and Technology in Arusha Tanzania.

Patients meeting the VL clinical case definition should be tested by rK39 rapid diagnostic test (RDT) followed by the Direct Agglutination Test (DAT) or tissue aspiration if RDT-negative. Otherwise, RDT-positive patients should be started on VL treatment. We evaluated how this guideline is adhered to by assessing the routine clinical practice in a university hospital in North-West Ethiopia. Methods Retrospective record analysis was done for all patients who had an rK39-RDT done at University of Gondar (UoG) Hospital between June 2012 and June 2013. We described the diagnostic work-up performed and the proportion initiated on VL treatment by test result. Results/Findings From a total of 928 patients tested, 308 (33.2%) were rK39 RDT-positive. Spleen or bone marrow aspiration was done for 237 (77.2%) RDT-positive patients. Of these, 165 were confirmed parasitologically, yielding a positive predictive value of 69.6%. Only 126 (20.3%) of the 620 patients with a negative rK39 test underwent further testing by tissue aspiration, of which 22 (17.5%) were also parasitology positive. HIV test results were available for 570 (61.4%) patients and 36 (6.3%) were HIV-infected. Of the 187 parasitologically confirmed patients, 182 (97.3%) were started on VL treatment. Conclusions / Discussion A negative rK39 test was often not followed by further testing and a positive rK39 test result was followed by tissue aspiration in three out of four cases. Further research is required to understand why the diagnostic work-up did not comply with the guidelines, including evaluating adherence to the VL clinical case definition and quality of rK39-RDT testing.","[Diro, Ermias; Takele, Yegnasew; Mengesha, Bewketu; Adem, Emebet; Mohammed, Rezika] Univ Gondar, Gondar, Ethiopia; [Diro, Ermias; Lynen, Lutgarde; Boelaert, Marleen; van Griensven, Johan] Inst Trop Med, B-2000 Antwerp, Belgium; [Assefa, Mahlet] Yale Univ, Hartford, CT USA; [Kimutai, Robert] Drugs Neglected Dis Initiat DNDi Africa, Nairobi, Kenya; [Hailu, Asrat] Univ Addis Ababa, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia","Diro, E (reprint author), Univ Gondar, Gondar, Ethiopia.",Ermi_diro@yahoo.com,"Boelaert, Marleen/E-2698-2012","Boelaert, Marleen/0000-0001-8051-6776; Takele, Yegnasew/0000-0003-1070-7459",European Union [305178]; Drugs for Neglected Diseases initiative; Belgian Directorate General for Development Cooperation under the ITM-DGDC framework agreement FA-III,"The research leading to these results has received funding from the European Union Seventh Framework Programme (FP7/2007-2013) under grant agreement no 305178 via AfriCoLeish project, and the Drugs for Neglected Diseases initiative.

Genetic differences in tEPEC strains could underlie some of the variability in clinical outcome. Methods We produced draft genome sequences of all available tEPEC strains from GEMS lethal infections (LIs) and of closely matched EPEC strains from GEMS subjects with non-lethal symptomatic infections (NSIs) and asymptomatic infections (AIs) to identify gene clusters (potential protein encoding sequences sharing >= 90% nucleotide sequence identity) associated with lethality. Results Among 14,412 gene clusters identified, the presence or absence of 392 was associated with clinical outcome. As expected, more gene clusters were associated with LI versus AI than LI versus NSI. The gene clusters more prevalent in strains from LI than those from NSI and AI included those encoding proteins involved in O-antigen biogenesis, while clusters encoding type 3 secretion effectors EspJ and OspB were among those more prevalent in strains from non-lethal infections. One gene cluster encoding a variant of an NleG ubiquitin ligase was associated with LI versus AI, while two other nleG clusters had the opposite association. Similar associations were found for two nleG gene clusters in an additional, larger sample of NSI and AI GEMS strains. Conclusions Particular genes are associated with lethal tEPEC infections. Further study of these factors holds potential to unravel the mechanisms underlying severe disease and to prevent adverse outcomes.","[Donnenberg, Michael S.; Farag, Tamer H.] Univ Maryland, Sch Med, Dept Med, Baltimore, MD 21201 USA; [Hazen, Tracy H.; Rasko, David A.] Univ Maryland, Sch Med, Dept Microbiol & Immunol, Inst Genome Sci, Baltimore, MD 21201 USA; [Panchalingam, Sandra; Levine, Myron M.; Kotloff, Karen] Univ Maryland, Sch Med, Ctr Vaccine Dev, Baltimore, MD 21201 USA; [Antonio, Martin] MRC, Fajara, Gambia; [Hossain, Anowar] Int Ctr Diarrhoeal Dis Res, Dhaka 1000, Bangladesh; [Mandomando, Inacio] Ctr Invest Saude Manh, Maputo, Mozambique; [Ochieng, John Benjamin] Kenya Govt Med Res Ctr, Ctr Dis Control, Kisumu, Kenya; [Ramamurthy, Thandavarayan] Natl Inst Cholera & Enter Dis, Kolkata, India; [Tamboura, Boubou] Ctr Vaccine Dev, Bamako, Mali; [Zaidi, Anita] Aga Khan Univ, Karachi, Pakistan; [Nataro, James P.] Univ Virginia, Sch Med, Dept Pediat, Charlottesville, VA 22908 USA","Donnenberg, MS (reprint author), Univ Maryland, Sch Med, Dept Med, Baltimore, MD 21201 USA.",mdonnenb@umaryland.edu; drasko@som.umaryland.edu,"PANCHALINGAM, SANDRA/W-2663-2019; kotloff, karen l/E-7768-2012","kotloff, karen l/0000-0003-1808-6431; David, Rasko/0000-0002-7337-7154",National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases of the National Institutes of Health [U19AI090873],"MSD, THH and DAR were funded to conduct the research reported in this study by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (www.niaid.nih.gov) of the National Institutes of Health through award U19AI090873.

Since their inception, the MDGs have been considered the international standard for measuring development progress and have provided a blueprint for global health policy and programming. However, emphasis upon the achievement of priority benchmarks around the ""big three"" diseases-namely HIV, tuberculosis (TB), and malaria-has influenced global health entities to disproportionately allocate resources. Meanwhile, several tropical diseases that almost exclusively impact the poorest of the poor continue to be neglected, despite the existence of cost-effective and feasible methods of control or elimination. One such Neglected Tropical Disease (NTD), onchocerciasis, more commonly known as river blindness, is a debilitating and stigmatizing disease primarily affecting individuals living in remote and impoverished areas. Onchocerciasis control is considered to be one of the most successful and cost-effective public health campaigns ever launched. In addition to improving the health and well-being of millions of individuals, these programs also lead to improvements in education, agricultural production, and economic development in affected communities. Perhaps most pertinent to the global health community, though, is the demonstrated effectiveness of facilitating community engagement by allowing communities considerable ownership with regard to drug delivery. This paper reviews the contributions that such concentrated efforts to control and eliminate onchocerciasis make to achieving select MDGs. The authors hope to draw the attention of public policymakers and global health funders to the importance of the struggle against onchocerciasis as a model for community-directed interventions to advance health and development, and to advocate for NTDs inclusion in the post 2015 agenda.","[Dunn, Caitlin; Callahan, Kelly; Katabarwa, Moses; Richards, Frank; Hopkins, Donald; Withers, P.

Nevertheless, limited information exists on patterns of contact with wildlife in communities that practice bushmeat hunting, especially with respect to social drivers of hunting behavior. We used interview responses from hunters and non-hunters in rural hunting communities in Nigeria to: 1) quantify contact rates with wildlife, 2) identify specific hunting behaviors that increase frequency of contact, 3) identify socioeconomic factors that predispose individuals to hunt, and 4) measure perceptions of risk. Participants engaged in a variety of behaviors that increased contact with wild animals, including: butchering to sell (37%), being injured (14%), using body parts for traditional medicine (19%), collecting carcasses found in forests and/or farms (18%), and keeping as pets (16%). Hunters came into contact with wildlife significantly more than non-hunters, even through non-hunting exposure pathways. Participants reported hunting rodents (95%), ungulates (93%), carnivores (93%), primates (87%), and bats (42%), among other prey. Reported hunting frequencies within taxonomic groups of prey were different for different hunting behaviors. Young age, lower education level, larger household size, having a father who hunts, and cultural group were all associated with becoming a hunter. Fifty-five percent of respondents were aware that they could contract diseases from wild animals, but only 26% of these individuals reported taking protective measures. Overall, hunters in this setting frequently contact a diversity of prey in risky ways, and the decision to become a hunter stems from family tradition, modified by economic necessity. Conservation and public health interventions in such settings may be most efficient when they capitalize on local knowledge and target root socio-economic and cultural drivers that lead to hunting behavior. Importantly, interventions that target consumption alone will not be sufficient; other drivers and modes of interaction with wildlife must also be considered.","[Friant, Sagan; Goldberg, Tony L.] Univ Wisconsin, Nelson Inst Environm Studies, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Paige, Sarah B.; Goldberg, Tony L.] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Pathobiol Sci, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Paige, Sarah B.; Goldberg, Tony L.] Univ Wisconsin, Global Hlth Inst, Madison, WI USA","Goldberg, TL (reprint author), Univ Wisconsin, Nelson Inst Environm Studies, Madison, WI 53706 USA.",tgoldberg@svm.vetmed.wisc.edu,,"Friant, Sagan/0000-0003-1664-5180",Fulbright International Institute of Education; National Institutes of Health as part of the Parasitology and Vector Biology Training Program [T32AI007414],"This work was funded by the Fulbright International Institute of Education (SF) and National Institutes of Health grant T32AI007414, as part of the Parasitology and Vector Biology Training Program (SF).

In this system, liver tissue is unfixed, unfrozen, and alive for maintenance in culture and subsequent molecular analysis. Methods and Findings Using thick naive mouse liver tissue and sterile culture conditions, the addition of soluble egg antigen (SEA) derived from Schistosoma japonicum eggs, followed 4, 24 and 48hrs time points. Tissue was collected for transcriptional analysis and supernatants collected to quantitate liver enzymes, cytokines and chemokines. No significant hepatotoxicity was demonstrated by supernatant liver enzymes due to the presence of SEA. A proinflammatory response was observed both at the transcriptional level and at the protein level by cytokine and chemokine bead assay. Key genes observed elevated transcription in response to the addition of SEA included: IL1-alpha and IL1-beta, IL6, all associated with inflammation. The recruitment of antigen presenting cells was reflected in increases in transcription of CD40, CCL4 and CSF1. Indications of tissue remodeling were seen in elevated gene expression of various Matrix MetalloProteinases (MMP3, 9, 10, 13) and delayed increases in TIMP1. Collagen deposition was significantly reduced in the presence of SEA as shown in COL1A1 expression by qPCR after 24hrs culture. Cytokine and chemokine analysis of the culture supernatants confirmed the elevation of proteins including IL6, CCL3, CCL4 and CXCL5. Conclusions This ex vivo model system for the synchronised delivery of parasite antigen to liver tissue provides an insight into the early phase of hepatic schistosomiasis, corresponding with the release of soluble proteins from dying schistosome eggs.","[Gobert, Geoffrey N.; Nawaratna, Sujeevi K.; Harvie, Marina; Ramm, Grant A.; McManus, Donald P.] QIMR Berghofer Med Res Inst, Herston, Qld, Australia","Gobert, GN (reprint author), QIMR Berghofer Med Res Inst, Herston, Qld, Australia.",Geoffrey.Gobert@qimrberghofer.edu.au,"Ramm, Grant A/A-4024-2019; Gobert, Geoffrey/V-2985-2019; Ramm, Grant A/G-2669-2013; McManus, Donald P./G-2678-2013","Gobert, Geoffrey/0000-0001-5884-6453","National Health and Medical Research Council of Australia (NHMRC); NHMRC [APP1037304, APP1002245]","The support of the National Health and Medical Research Council of Australia (NHMRC http://www.nhmrc.gov.au) with NHMRC Program Grant (APP1037304) and NHMRC Project Grant (APP1002245) funding is acknowledged.

Because the immune and inflammatory response to Leishmania (Viannia) species defines the outcome of infection and efficacy of treatment, immunomodulation is considered a promising therapeutic strategy. However, since Leishmania infection and antileishmanial drugs can themselves modulate drug transport, metabolism and/or immune responses, immunotherapeutic approaches require integrated assessment of host and parasite responses. Methodology To achieve an integrated assessment of current and innovative therapeutic strategies, we determined host and parasite responses to miltefosine and meglumine antimoniate alone and in combination with pentoxifylline or CpG 2006 in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of cutaneous leishmaniasis patients. Parasite survival and secretion of TNF-alpha, IFN-gamma, IL-10 and IL-13 were evaluated concomitantly in PBMCs infected with Luc-L. (V.) panamensis exposed to meglumine antimoniate (4, 8, 16, 32 and 64 mu g Sb-V/mL) or miltefosine (2, 4, 8, 16 and 32 mu M HePC). Concentrations of 4 mu M of miltefosine and 8 mu g Sb-V/mL were selected for evaluation in combination with immunomodulators based on the high but partial reduction of parasite burden by these antileishmanial concentrations without affecting cytokine secretion of infected PBMCs. Intracellular parasite survival was determined by luminometry and cytokine secretion measured by ELISA and multiplex assays. Principal Findings Anti-and pro-inflammatory cytokines characteristic of L. (V.) panamensis infection were evaluable concomitantly with viability of Leishmania within monocyte-derived macrophages present in PBMC cultures. Both antileishmanial drugs reduced the parasite load of macrophages; miltefosine also suppressed IL-10 and IL-13 secretion in a dose dependent manner. Pentoxifylline did not affect parasite survival or alter antileishmanial effects of miltefosine or meglumine antimoniate. However, pentoxifylline diminished secretion of TNF-alpha, IFN-gamma and IL-13, cytokines associated with the outcome of infection by species of the Viannia subgenus. Exposure to CpG diminished the leishmanicidal effect of meglumine antimoniate, but not miltefosine, and significantly reduced secretion of IL -10, alone and in combination with either antileishmanial drug. IL-13 increased in response to CpG plus miltefosine. Conclusions and Significance Human PBMCs allow integrated ex vivo assessment of antileishmanial treatments, providing information on host and parasite determinants of therapeutic response that may be used to tailor therapeutic strategies to optimize clinical resolution.","[Gonzalez-Fajardo, Laura; Lucia Fernandez, Olga; Gore Saravia, Nancy] Ctr Int Entrenamiento & Invest Med CIDEIM, Cali, Colombia; [McMahon-Pratt, Diane] Yale Univ, Sch Publ Hlth, New Haven, CT USA","Gonzalez-Fajardo, L (reprint author), Ctr Int Entrenamiento & Invest Med CIDEIM, Cali, Colombia.",saravian@cideim.org.co,"Gonzalez-Fajardo, Laura/W-3181-2018","Gonzalez-Fajardo, Laura/0000-0003-2351-4808","United States National Institute of Allergy And Infectious Diseases of the National Institutes of Health [R01AI093775]; Colombian National Departamento Administrativo de Ciencia, Tecnologia e Innovacion (COLCIENCIAS) [2229-519-28964]; Fogarty International Center of the National Institutes of Health [D43 TW006589]; COLCIENCIAS Young Investigators and Innovators Program [138-2010, 0040-2012]; COLCIENCIAS","This research was financed in part by the United States National Institute of Allergy And Infectious Diseases of the National Institutes of Health under Award Number R01AI093775, and contract 2229-519-28964 from the Colombian National Departamento Administrativo de Ciencia, Tecnologia e Innovacion (COLCIENCIAS).

In India, 241 million children are estimated to need deworming to avert the negative consequences STH infections can have on child health and development. In February-April 2011, 17 million children in Bihar State were dewormed during a government-led school-based deworming campaign. Prior to programme implementation, a study was conducted to assess STH prevalence in the school-age population to direct the programme. The study also investigated risk factors for STH infections, including caste, literacy, and defecation and hygiene practices, in order to inform the development of complementary interventions. Methods A cross-sectional survey was conducted among children in 20 schools in Bihar. In addition to providing stool samples for identification of STH infections, children completed a short questionnaire detailing their usual defecation and hand-hygiene practices. Risk factors for STH infections were explored. Results In January-February 2011, 1279 school children aged four to seventeen provided stool samples and 1157 children also completed the questionnaire. Overall, 68% of children (10-86% across schools) were infected with one or more soil-transmitted helminth species. The prevalence of ascariasis, hookworm and trichuriasis was 52%, 42% and 5% respectively. The majority of children (95%) practiced open defecation and reported most frequently cleansing hands with soil (61%). Increasing age, lack of maternal literacy and certain castes were independently associated with hookworm infection. Absence of a hand-washing station at the schools was also independently associated with A. lumbricoides infection. Conclusions STH prevalence in Bihar is high, and justifies mass deworming in school-aged children. Open defecation is common-place and hands are often cleansed using soil. The findings reported here can be used to help direct messaging appropriate to mothers with low levels of literacy and emphasise the importance of water and sanitation in the control of helminths and other diseases.","[Greenland, Katie; Gunawardena, Kithsiri; Smith, Jennifer L.] London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, Fac Infect & Trop Dis, London WC1, England; [Dixon, Ruth; Drake, Lesley] Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Partnership Child Dev, London, England; [Dixon, Ruth; Drake, Lesley; Makkar, Prerna; Raman, Sri] Deworm World, Washington, DC USA; [Khan, Shabbir Ali] Univ Patna, Patna 800005, Bihar, India; [Gunawardena, Kithsiri] Univ Kelaniya, Fac Med, Dept Parasitol, Kelaniya, Sri Lanka; [Kihara, Jimmy H.] Kenya Med Res Inst KEMRI, Eastern & Souther Africa Ctr Int Parasite Control, Nairobi, Kenya; [Drake, Lesley] Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Sch Publ Hlth, Fac Med, London Ctr Neglected Trop Dis Res, London, England; [Singh, Sarman] All India Inst Med Sci, Div Clin Microbiol & Mol Med, New Delhi, India; [Kumar, Sanjay] Secretary Hlth Cum Execut Director State Hlth Soc, Patna, Bihar, India","Greenland, K (reprint author), London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, Fac Infect & Trop Dis, London WC1, England.",katie.greenland@lshtm.ac.uk; r.dixon@malariaconsortium.org,,"Singh, Prof. Sarman/0000-0002-0749-9647",Government of Bihar; World Bank,"The work was funded by the Government of Bihar with support from the World Bank.

Overuse of chemotherapeutics against fascioliasis has increased the populations of drug resistant parasites. F. hepatica cathepsin L3 is a protease that plays important roles during the life cycle of fluke. Due to its particular collagenolytic activity it is considered an attractive target against the infective phase of F. hepatica. Methodology/Principal Findings Starting with a three dimensional model of FhCL3 we performed a structure-based design of novel inhibitors through a computational study that combined virtual screening, molecular dynamics simulations, and binding free energy (Delta G(bind)) calculations. Virtual screening was carried out by docking inhibitors obtained from the MYBRIDGE-HitFinder database inside FhCL3 and human cathepsin L substrate-binding sites. On the basis of dock-scores, five compounds were predicted as selective inhibitors of FhCL3. Molecular dynamic simulations were performed and, subsequently, an end-point method was employed to predict Delta G(bind) values. Two compounds with the best Delta G(bind) values (-10.68 kcal/mol and -7.16 kcal/mol), comparable to that of the positive control (-10.55 kcal/mol), were identified. A similar approach was followed to structurally and energetically characterize the interface of FhCL3 in complex with a peptidic substrate. Finally, through pair-wise and per-residue free energy decomposition we identified residues that are critical for the substrate/ligand binding and for the enzyme specificity. Conclusions/Significance The present study is the first computer-aided drug design approach against F. hepatica cathepsins. Here we predict the principal determinants of binding of FhCL3 in complex with a natural substrate by detailed energetic characterization of protease interaction surface. We also propose novel compounds as FhCL3 inhibitors. Overall, these results will foster the future rational design of new inhibitors against FhCL3, as well as other F. hepatica cathepsins.","[Hernandez Alvarez, Lilian; Naranjo Feliciano, Dany] Ctr Nacl Sanidad Agr Cuba CENSA, Dept Biol Mol, San Jose De Las Lajas, Mayabeque, Cuba; [Hernandez Gonzalez, Jorge Enrique] Univ La Habana, Fac Biol, CEP, Havana, Cuba; [Soares, Rosemberg de Oliveira; Barreto Gomes, Diego Enry; Pascutti, Pedro Geraldo] Univ Fed Rio de Janeiro, Inst Biofis Carlos Chagas Filho, BR-21941 Rio De Janeiro, Brazil; [Soares, Rosemberg de Oliveira; Barreto Gomes, Diego Enry] Inst Nacl Metrol Qualidade & Tecnol INMETRO, Diretoria Metrol Aplicada Ciencias Vida DIMAV, Rio De Janeiro, Brazil","Alvarez, LH (reprint author), Ctr Nacl Sanidad Agr Cuba CENSA, Dept Biol Mol, San Jose De Las Lajas, Mayabeque, Cuba.",pascutti@biof.ufrj.br,,,International Foundation for Science (IFS) [B/4908-1]; Ministerio da Educacao e Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES) [173/12],"DNF was supported by International Foundation for Science (IFS), grant B/4908-1.

Approximately 10% of these occur in the Mesoamerican and Caribbean regions. During the last decade, malaria transmission in Mesoamerica showed a decrease of similar to 85%; whereas, in the Caribbean region, Hispaniola (comprising the Dominican Republic [DR] and Haiti) presented an overall rise in malaria transmission, primarily due to a steady increase in Haiti, while DR experienced a significant transmission decrease in this period. The significant malaria reduction observed recently in the region prompted the launch of an initiative for Malaria Elimination in Mesoamerica and Hispaniola (EMMIE) with the active involvement of the National Malaria Control Programs (NMCPs) of nine countries, the Regional Coordination Mechanism (RCM) for Mesoamerica, and the Council of Health Ministries of Central America and Dominican Republic (COMISCA). The EMMIE initiative is supported by the Global Fund for Aids, Tuberculosis and Malaria (GFATM) with active participation of multiple partners including Ministries of Health, bilateral and multilateral agencies, as well as research centers. EMMIE's main goal is to achieve elimination of malaria transmission in the region by 2020. Here we discuss the prospects, challenges, and research needs associated with this initiative that, if successful, could represent a paradigm for other malaria-affected regions.","[Herrera, Socrates; Andres Ochoa-Orozco, Sergio; Arevalo-Herrera, Myriam] Caucaseco Sci Res Ctr, Cali, Colombia; [Herrera, Socrates; Andres Ochoa-Orozco, Sergio] Malaria Vaccine & Drug Dev Ctr, Cali, Colombia; [Gonzalez, Iveth J.] FIND, Geneva, Switzerland; [Peinado, Lucrecia] Hlth Management Consultant, Guatemala City, Guatemala; [Quinones, Martha L.] Univ Nacl Colombia, Bogota, Colombia; [Arevalo-Herrera, Myriam] Univ Valle, Fac Salud, Cali, Colombia","Herrera, S (reprint author), Caucaseco Sci Res Ctr, Cali, Colombia.",sherrera@inmuno.org,,,"US National Institute of Health, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIH/NIAD) through the Centro Latino Americano de Investigacion en Malaria (CLAIM) [5U19AI089702]; Departamento Administrativo de Ciencia, Tecnologia e Innovacion (Colciencias) of Colombia [360-2011]; Foundation for Innovative New Diagnostics (FIND)","The funders had no role in study design, data collection and analysis, decision to publish, or preparation of the manuscript.

Treatment options for helminth infections are limited, and there is a paucity of drug-development research in this area. Limited evidence suggests that antiretroviral therapy (ART) reduces prevalence of helminth infections in HIV-infected individuals. We investigated whether ART exposure and cotrimoxazole preventive therapy (CTX-P) is associated with a reduced prevalence of helminth infections. Methodology and Principal Findings This cross-sectional study was conducted at a primary HIV-clinic in Lambarene, Gabon. HIV-infected adults who were ART-naive or exposed to ART for at least 3 months submitted one blood sample and stool and urine samples on 3 consecutive days. Outcome was helminth infection with intestinal helminths, Schistosoma haematobium, Loa loa or Mansonella perstans. Multivariable logistic regression was used to assess associations between ART or CTX-P and helminth infection. In total, 408 patients were enrolled. Helminth infection was common (77/252 [30.5%]). Filarial infections were most prevalent (55/310 [17.7%]), followed by infection with intestinal helminths (35/296 [11.8%]) and S. haematobium (19/323 5.9%]). Patients on CTX-P had a reduced risk of Loa loa microfilaremia (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 0.47, 95% CI 0.23-0.97, P = 0.04), also in the subgroup of patients on ART (aOR 0.36, 95% CI 0.13-0.96, P = 0.04). There was no effect of ART exposure on helminth infection prevalence. Conclusions/Significance CTX-P use was associated with a decreased risk of Loa loa infection, suggesting an anthelminthic effect of antifolate drugs. No relation between ART use and helminth infections was established.","[Janssen, Saskia; Knap, Martijn; Moekotte, Alma; Belard, Sabine; Grobusch, Martin P.] Univ Amsterdam, Acad Med Ctr, Div Internal Med, Ctr Trop Med & Travel Med,Dept Infect Dis, NL-1105 AZ Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Janssen, Saskia; Rossatanga, Elie G.] CTA, Lambarene, Gabon; [Janssen, Saskia; Knap, Martijn; Moekotte, Alma; Adegnika, Akim A.; Belard, Sabine; Haenscheid, Thomas; Grobusch, Martin P.] Ctr Rech Med Lambarene CERMEL, Lambarene, Gabon; [Janssen, Saskia; Adegnika, Akim A.; Belard, Sabine; Grobusch, Martin P.] Univ Tubingen, Inst Trop Med, Tubingen, Germany; [Janssen, Saskia; Grobusch, Martin P.] Univ Cape Town, Inst Infect Dis & Mol Med, Clin Infect Dis Res Initiat, ZA-7925 Cape Town, South Africa; [Hermans, Sabine] Univ Cape Town, Inst Infect Dis & Mol Med, Desmond Tutu HIV Ctr, ZA-7925 Cape Town, South Africa; [Hermans, Sabine; Grobusch, Martin P.] Univ Amsterdam, Acad Med Ctr, Amsterdam Inst Global Hlth & Dev, Dept Global Hlth, NL-1105 AZ Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Hermans, Sabine] Makerere Univ, Coll Hlth Sci, Dept Internal Med, Sch Med, Kampala, Uganda; [Belard, Sabine] Charite, Dept Pediat Pneumol & Immunol, D-13353 Berlin, Germany; [Haenscheid, Thomas] Fac Med Lisbon, Inst Microbiol, Lisbon, Portugal","Janssen, S (reprint author), Univ Amsterdam, Acad Med Ctr, Div Internal Med, Ctr Trop Med & Travel Med,Dept Infect Dis, Meibergdreef 9, NL-1105 AZ Amsterdam, Netherlands.",s.janssen@amc.nl,"Belard, Sabine/J-9557-2019","Hanscheid, Thomas/0000-0001-6353-9132",UBS Optimus Foundation,"This study was supported by a grant from the UBS Optimus Foundation (https://www.ubs.com/global/en/wealth_management/optimusfoundation.html).

Conventional parasitological methods are insensitive for the detection of light-intensity infections. Techniques with high sensitivity and specificity are required for an accurate diagnosis in low-transmission settings and verification of elimination. We determined the accuracy of a urine-based up-converting phosphor-lateral flow circulating anodic antigen (UCP-LF CAA) assay for Schistosoma haematobium diagnosis in low-prevalence settings in Zanzibar, Tanzania. Methodology A total of 1,740 urine samples were collected in 2013 from children on Pemba Island, from schools where the S. haematobium prevalence was <2%, 2-5%, and 5-10%, based on a single urine filtration. On the day of collection, all samples were tested for microhematuria with reagent strips and for the presence of S. haematobium eggs with microscopy. Eight months later, 1.5 ml of urine from each of 1,200 samples stored at -20 degrees C were analyzed by UCP-LF CAA assay, while urine filtration slides were subjected to quality control (QCUF). In the absence of a true 'gold' standard, the diagnostic performance was calculated using latent class analyses (LCA). Principal Findings The 'empirical' S. haematobium prevalence revealed by UCP-LF CAA, QCUF, and reagent strips was 14%, 5%, and 4%, respectively. LCA revealed a sensitivity of the UCP-LF CAA, QCUF, and reagent strips of 97% (95% confidence interval (CI): 91-100%), 86% (95% CI: 72-99%), and 67% (95% CI: 52-81%), respectively. Test specificities were consistently above 90%. Conclusions/Significance The UCP-LF CAA assay shows high sensitivity for the diagnosis of S. haematobium in low-endemicity settings. Empirically, it detects a considerably higher number of infections than microscopy. Hence, the UCP-LF CAA employed in combination with QCUF, is a promising tool for monitoring and surveillance of urogenital schistosomiasis in low-transmission settings targeted for elimination.","[Knopp, Stefanie; Rollinson, David] Nat Hist Museum, Dept Life Sci, Wolfson Wellcome Biomed Labs, London SW7 5BD, England; [Knopp, Stefanie; Utzinger, Jurg] Swiss Trop & Publ Hlth Inst, Dept Epidemiol & Publ Hlth, Basel, Switzerland; [Knopp, Stefanie; Utzinger, Jurg] Univ Basel, Basel, Switzerland; [Corstjens, Paul L.

Pathogens transmitted by ticks have to overcome innate immunity barriers present in tick tissues, including midgut, salivary glands epithelia and the hemocoel. Molecularly, invertebrate immunity is initiated when pathogen recognition molecules trigger serum or cellular signalling cascades leading to the production of antimicrobials, pathogen opsonization and phagocytosis. We presently aimed at identifying hemocyte transcripts from semi-engorged female I. ricinus ticks by mass sequencing a hemocyte cDNA library and annotating immune-related transcripts based on their hemocyte abundance as well as their ubiquitous distribution. Methodology/principal findings De novo assembly of 926,596 pyrosequence reads plus 49,328,982 Illumina reads (148 nt length) from a hemocyte library, together with over 189 million Illumina reads from salivary gland and midgut libraries, generated 15,716 extracted coding sequences (CDS); these are displayed in an annotated hyperlinked spreadsheet format. Read mapping allowed the identification and annotation of tissue-enriched transcripts. A total of 327 transcripts were found significantly over expressed in the hemocyte libraries, including those coding for scavenger receptors, antimicrobial peptides, pathogen recognition proteins, proteases and protease inhibitors. Vitellogenin and lipid metabolism transcription enrichment suggests fat body components. We additionally annotated ubiquitously distributed transcripts associated with immune function, including immune-associated signal transduction proteins and transcription factors, including the STAT transcription factor. Conclusions/significance This is the first systems biology approach to describe the genes expressed in the haemocytes of this neglected disease vector. A total of 2,860 coding sequences were deposited to GenBank, increasing to 27,547 the number so far deposited by our previous transcriptome studies that serves as a discovery platform for studies with I. ricinus biochemistry and physiology.","[Kotsyfakis, Michalis; Kopacek, Petr; Franta, Zdenek] Czech Acad Sci, Ctr Biol, Inst Parasitol, Budweis, Czech Republic; [Pedra, Joao H.

Research on the pathogenesis and treatment of the disease has centred to date on the characteristic neurological symptoms, whereas cardiac dysfunction (e. g. ventricular arrhythmias) in AT remains largely unstudied. Animal models of AT demonstrating cardiac dysfunction similar to that described in field cases of AT are critically required to transform our understanding of AT-induced cardiac pathophysiology and identify future treatment strategies. We have previously shown that T. brucei can interact with heart muscle cells (cardiomyocytes) to induce ventricular arrhythmias in ex vivo adult rat hearts. However, it is unknown whether the arrhythmias observed ex vivo are also present during in vivo infection in experimental animal models. Here we show for the first time the characterisation of ventricular arrhythmias in vivo in two animal models of AT infection using electrocardiographic (ECG) monitoring. The first model utilised a commonly used monomorphic laboratory strain, Trypanosoma brucei brucei Lister 427, whilst the second model used a pleomorphic laboratory strain, T. b. brucei TREU 927, which demonstrates a similar chronic infection profile to clinical cases. The frequency of ventricular arrhythmias and heart rate (HR) was significantly increased at the endpoint of infection in the TREU 927 infection model, but not in the Lister 427 infection model. At the end of infection, hearts from both models were isolated and Langendorff perfused ex vivo with increasing concentrations of the beta-adrenergic agonist isoproterenol (ISO). Interestingly, the increased frequency of arrhythmias observed in vivo in the TREU 927 infection model was lost upon isolation of the heart ex vivo, but re-emerged with the addition of ISO. Our results demonstrate that TREU 927 infection modifies the substrate of the myocardium in such a way as to increase the propensity for ventricular arrhythmias in response to a circulating factor in vivo or beta-adrenergic stimulation ex vivo. The TREU 927 infection model provides a new opportunity to accelerate our understanding of AT-related cardiac pathophysiology and importantly has the required sensitivity to monitor adverse cardiac-related electrical dysfunction when testing new therapeutic treatments for AT.","[McCarroll, Charlotte S.; Rossor, Charlotte L.; Loughrey, Christopher M.] Univ Glasgow, Coll Med Vet & Life Sci, Inst Cardiovasc & Med Sci, Glasgow, Lanark, Scotland; [Morrison, Linda R.] Univ Edinburgh, Royal Dick Sch Vet Studies, Easter Bush Pathol, Edinburgh EH8 9YL, Midlothian, Scotland; [Morrison, Linda R.] Univ Edinburgh, Roslin Inst, Edinburgh EH8 9YL, Midlothian, Scotland; [Morrison, Liam J.] Univ Glasgow, Coll Med Vet & Life Sci, Inst Infect Immun & Inflammat, Wellcome Trust Ctr Mol Parasitol, Glasgow, Lanark, Scotland; [Morrison, Liam J.] Univ Edinburgh, Royal Dick Sch Vet Studies, Roslin Inst, Edinburgh EH8 9YL, Midlothian, Scotland","McCarroll, CS (reprint author), Univ Glasgow, Coll Med Vet & Life Sci, Inst Cardiovasc & Med Sci, Glasgow, Lanark, Scotland.",christopher.loughrey@glasgow.ac.uk,"; Loughrey, Christopher/B-2599-2010","McCarroll, Charlotte/0000-0002-2816-2285; Loughrey, Christopher/0000-0003-1297-9159; Morrison, Liam/0000-0002-8304-9066",Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC); BBSRC Integrated Mammalian Biology MRes grant; Wellcome Trust [085349]; Royal Society [UF090083],"This work was supported by Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC; http://www.bbsrc.ac.uk/home/home.aspx) doctoral training grant (to CSM), BBSRC Integrated Mammalian Biology MRes grant (to CML), the Wellcome Trust (http://www.wellcome.ac.uk) and the Royal Society (University Research Fellowship UF090083 to LM https://royalsociety.org).

A proficiency panel of 13 samples containing various concentrations of inactivated LASV strains Josiah, Lib-1580/121, CSF, or AV was prepared. Samples containing the LASV-related lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) and negative sera were included as specificity controls. Twenty-four laboratories from 17 countries (13 European, one African, one Asian, two American countries) participated in the study. Thirteen laboratories (54%) reported correct results, 4 (17%) laboratories reported 1 to 2 false-negative results, and 7 (29%) laboratories reported 3 to 5 false-negative results. This EQA study indicates that most participating laboratories have a good or acceptable performance in molecular detection of LASV.

Major advances have been made in mammalian systems to define nanoparticle (NP) characteristics that condition trafficking and biodistribution of NPs in the host. Such information is critical for effective delivery of therapeutics and molecules to cells and organs, but little is known about biodistribution of NPs in mosquitoes. Methodology/Principal Findings PRINT technology was used to construct a library of fluorescently labeled hydrogel NPs of defined size, shape, and surface charge. The biodistribution (organ, tissue, and cell tropisms and trafficking kinetics) of positively and negatively charged 200 nm x 200 nm, 80 nm x 320 nm, and 80 nm x 5000 nm NPs was determined in adult Anopheles gambiae mosquitoes as a function of the route of challenge (ingestion, injection or contact) using whole body imaging and fluorescence microscopy. Mosquitoes readily ingested NPs in sugar solution. Whole body fluorescence imaging revealed substantial NP accumulation (load) in the alimentary tracts of the adult mosquitoes, with the greatest loads in the diverticula, cardia and foregut. Positively and negatively charged NPs differed in their biodistribution and trafficking. Following oral challenge, negatively charged NPs transited the alimentary tract more rapidly than positively charged NPs. Following contact challenge, negatively charged NPs trafficked more efficiently in alimentary tract tissues. Following parenteral challenge, positively and negatively charged NPs differed in tissue tropisms and trafficking in the hemocoel. Injected NPs were also detected in cardia/foregut, suggesting trafficking of NPs from the hemocoel into the alimentary tract. Conclusions/Significance Herein we have developed a tool box of NPs with the biodistribution and tissue tropism characteristics for gene structure/function studies and for delivery of vector lethal cargoes for mosquito control.","[Paquette, Cynthia C.

Increasing mosquito resistance to chemical insecticides is a great public health concern, and new strategies/technologies are necessary to develop the next-generation of vector control tools. We propose to develop a novel method for mosquito control that employs nanoparticles (NPs) as a platform for delivery of mosquitocidal dsRNA molecules to silence mosquito genes and cause vector lethality. Identifying optimal NP chemistry and morphology is imperative for efficient mosquitocide delivery. Toward this end, fluorescently labeled polyethylene glycol NPs of specific sizes, shapes (80 nm x 320 nm, 80 nm x 5000 nm, 200 nm x 200 nm, and 1000 nm x 1000 nm) and charges (negative and positive) were fabricated by Particle Replication in Non-Wetting Templates (PRINT) technology. Biodistribution, persistence, and toxicity of PRINT NPs were evaluated in vitro in mosquito cell culture and in vivo in Anopheles gambiae larvae following parenteral and oral challenge. Following parenteral challenge, the biodistribution of the positively and negatively charged NPs of each size and shape was similar; intense fluorescence was observed in thoracic and abdominal regions of the larval body. Positively charged NPs were more associated with the gastric caeca in the gastrointestinal tract. Negatively charged NPs persisted through metamorphosis and were observed in head, body and ovaries of adults. Following oral challenge, NPs were detected in the larval mid-and hindgut. Positively charged NPs were more efficiently internalized in vitro than negatively charged NPs. Positively charged NPs trafficked to the cytosol, but negatively charged NPs co-localized with lysosomes. Following in vitro and in vivo challenge, none of the NPs tested induced any cytotoxic effects.","[Phanse, Yashdeep; Dunphy, Brendan M.; Airs, Paul M.; Bartholomay, Lyric C.] Iowa State Univ, Dept Entomol, Ames, IA USA; [Perry, Jillian L.; Xu, Jing; Luft, J.

Trypanosomatid protozoa cannot synthesize heme, so must acquire this essential cofactor from their environment. Earlier studies identified LHR1 as a Leishmania amazonensis transmembrane protein that mediates heme uptake. Null mutants of LHR1 are not viable and single knockout strains have reduced virulence, but very little is known about the properties of LHR1 directly associated with heme transport. Here, we use functional assays in Saccharomyces cerevisiae to show that specific tyrosine residues within the first three predicted transmembrane domains of LHR1 are required for efficient heme uptake. These tyrosines are unique to LHR1, consistent with the low similarity between LHR1 and its corresponding homologs in C. elegans and human. Substitution of these tyrosines in LHR1 resulted in varying degrees of heme transport inhibition, phenotypes that closely mirrored the impaired ability of L. amazonensis to replicate as intracellular amastigotes in macrophages and generate cutaneous lesions in mice. Taken together, our results imply that the mechanism for heme transport by LHR1 is distinctive and may have adapted to secure heme, a limiting cofactor, inside the host. Since LHR1 is significantly divergent from the human heme transporter HRG1, our findings lay the groundwork for selective targeting of LHR1 by small molecule antagonists.","[Renberg, Rebecca L.; Miguel, Danilo C.; Andrews, Norma W.; Flannery, Andrew R.] Univ Maryland, Dept Cell Biol & Mol Genet, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [Yuan, Xiaojing; Samuel, Tamika K.; Hamza, Iqbal] Univ Maryland, Dept Anim & Avian Sci, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [Flannery, Andrew R.] PathSensors Inc, Baltimore, MD USA","Renberg, RL (reprint author), Univ Maryland, Dept Cell Biol & Mol Genet, College Pk, MD 20742 USA.",norma.andrews@yale.edu; andrewsn@umd.edu,"Yuan, Xiaojing/V-6882-2019; Miguel, Danilo/C-1484-2012","Yuan, Xiaojing/0000-0002-0969-5748; Miguel, Danilo/0000-0003-0522-6562; Renberg, Rebecca/0000-0003-0640-5087; Hamza, Iqbal/0000-0003-0045-0610",National Institutes of Health [R01 AI0677979]; National Institutes of Health Training Grant [5 T32 AI89621],"This work was supported by National Institutes of Health Grant R01 AI0677979 to NWA and IH.

The molecular mechanisms underlying the pathophysiology and intraerythrocytic development of these parasites are poorly understood. This impedes concerted efforts aimed at the discovery of novel anti-babesiacidal agents. By applying sensitive cell biological and molecular functional genomics tools, we describe the intra-erythrocytic development cycle of B. divergens parasites from immature, mono-nucleated ring forms to bi-nucleated paired piriforms and ultimately multi-nucleated tetrads that characterizes zoonotic Babesia spp. This is further correlated for the first time to nuclear content increases during intra-erythrocytic development progression, providing insight into the part of the life cycle that occurs during human infection. High-content temporal evaluation elucidated the contribution of the different stages to life cycle progression. Moreover, molecular descriptors indicate that B. divergens parasites employ physiological adaptation to in vitro cultivation. Additionally, differential expression is observed as the parasite equilibrates its developmental stages during its life cycle. Together, this information provides the first temporal evaluation of the functional transcriptome of B. divergens parasites, information that could be useful in identifying biological processes essential to parasite survival for future anti-babesiacidal discoveries.","[Rossouw, Ingrid; Maritz-Olivier, Christine] Univ Pretoria, Dept Genet, ZA-0002 Pretoria, South Africa; [Niemand, Jandeli; van Biljon, Riette; Smit, Annel; Birkholtz, Lyn-Marie] Univ Pretoria, Dept Biochem, Ctr Sustainable Malaria Control, ZA-0002 Pretoria, South Africa; [Olivier, Nicholas A.] Univ Pretoria, Dept Plant Sci, ACGT, Microarray Facil, ZA-0002 Pretoria, South Africa","Rossouw, I (reprint author), Univ Pretoria, Dept Genet, ZA-0002 Pretoria, South Africa.",christine.maritz@up.ac.za; LynMarie.Birkholtz@up.ac.za,"; Birkholtz, Lyn-Marie/E-2939-2010; Niemand, Jandeli/E-2236-2015","Van Biljon, Riette/0000-0002-1710-0441; Smit, Annel/0000-0002-7936-5162; Birkholtz, Lyn-Marie/0000-0001-5888-2905; Niemand, Jandeli/0000-0002-5672-8725","South African National Research Foundation [FA2007050300003, UID 84627]; Medical Research Council; South African National Research Foundation Technology and Human Resources for Industry Programme (THRIP) [TP2010072300035]; National Research Foundation [73659]","This work was supported by a South African National Research Foundation (www.nrf.ac.za) (FA2007050300003 & UID 84627) and Medical Research Council (www.mrc.ac.za) grants to LMB as well as the South African National Research Foundation Technology and Human Resources for Industry Programme (THRIP, grant number TP2010072300035) awarded to CMO.

To enable this program, the size and distribution of the free-roaming dog population needed to be estimated. We present the results of a dog population survey and a pilot assessment of the CNVR program coverage in Dhaka City. Free-roaming dog population surveys were undertaken in 18 wards of Dhaka City on consecutive days using mark-resight methods. Data was analyzed using Lincoln-Petersen index-Chapman correction methods. The CNVR program was assessed over the two years (2012-2013) whilst the coverage of the CNVR program was assessed by estimating the proportion of dogs that were ear-notched (processed dogs) via dog population surveys. The free-roaming dog population was estimated to be 1,242 (95% CI: 1205-1278) in the 18 sampled wards and 18,585 dogs in Dhaka City (52 dogs/km(2)) with an estimated human-to-free-roaming dog ratio of 828: 1. During the two year CNVR program, a total of 6,665 dogs (3,357 male and 3,308 female) were neutered and vaccinated against rabies in 29 of the 92 city wards. A pilot population survey indicated a mean CNVR coverage of 60.6%(range 19.2-79.3%) with only eight wards achieving > 70% coverage. Given that the coverage in many neighborhoods was below the WHO-recommended threshold level of 70% for rabies eradications and since the CNVR program takes considerable time to implement throughout the entire Dhaka City area, a mass dog vaccination program in the non-CNVR coverage area is recommended to create herd immunity. The findings from this study are expected to guide dog population management and the rabies control program in Dhaka City and elsewhere in Bangladesh.","[Tenzin, Tenzin; Debnath, Nitish C.; Ahmed, Garba; Yamage, Mat] Food & Agr Org United Nat, Emergency Ctr Transboundary Anim Dis, Dhaka, Bangladesh; [Tenzin, Tenzin] Natl Ctr Anim Hlth, Dis Prevent & Control Unit, Thimphu, Bhutan; [Ahmed, Rubaiya] Obhoyaronno Bangladesh Anim Welf Fdn, Dhaka, Bangladesh","Tenzin, T (reprint author), Food & Agr Org United Nat, Emergency Ctr Transboundary Anim Dis, Dhaka, Bangladesh.",tenzinvp@gmail.com,,"Tenzin, Tenzin/0000-0002-4326-3623","FAO, Bangladesh; HSI corporation; City corporation","The Bangladesh Animal Welfare Foundation received fund and logistic support from FAO, Bangladesh, HSI, and City corporations.

Thymidine kinase (TK) catalyses the transfer of the.-phosphate of ATP to 2'-deoxythymidine (dThd) forming thymidine monophosphate (dTMP). L. major Type II TK (LmTK) has been previously shown to be important for infectivity of the parasite and therefore has potential as a drug target for anti-leishmanial therapy. In this study, we determined the enzymatic properties and the 3D structures of holo forms of the enzyme. LmTK efficiently phosphorylates dThd and dUrd and has high structural homology to TKs from other species. However, it significantly differs in its kinetic properties from Trypanosoma brucei TK since purines are not substrates of the enzyme and dNTPs such as dUTP inhibit LmTK. The enzyme had Km and k(cat) values for dThd of 1.1 mu M and 2.62 s(-1) and exhibits cooperative binding for ATP. Additionally, we show that the anti-retroviral prodrug zidovudine (3-azido-3-deoxythymidine, AZT) and 5'-modified dUrd can be readily phosphorylated by LmTK. The production of recombinant enzyme at a level suitable for structural studies was achieved by the construction of C-terminal truncated versions of the enzyme and the use of a baculoviral expression system. The structures of the catalytic core of LmTK in complex with dThd, the negative feedback regulator dTTP and the bi-substrate analogue AP(5)dT, were determined to 2.74, 3.00 and 2.40 angstrom, respectively, and provide the structural basis for exclusion of purines and dNTP inhibition. The results will aid the process of rational drug design with LmTK as a potential target for anti-leishmanial drugs.","[Timm, Jennifer; Wilson, Keith S.] Univ York, Dept Chem, Struct Biol Lab, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England; [Bosch-Navarrete, Cristina; Recio, Eliseo; Gonzalez-Pacanowska, Dolores] CSIC, Inst Parasitol & Biomed Lopez Neyra, Granada, Spain; [Nettleship, Joanne E.; Rada, Heather] Rutherford Appleton Lab, Oxford Prot Prod Facil, Didcot OX11 0QX, Oxon, England","Timm, J (reprint author), Univ York, Dept Chem, Struct Biol Lab, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England.",dgonzalez@ipb.csic.es; Keith.Wilson@york.ac.uk,,"Gonzalez-Pacanowska, Dolores/0000-0002-4303-5209; Nettleship, Joanne/0000-0002-1258-1733; Rada, Heather/0000-0003-1477-419X; Wilson, Keith/0000-0002-3581-2194; Timm, Jennifer/0000-0001-9750-3293","Medical Research Council, UK [MR/K018779/1]; RICET FIS Network [RD06/0021]; Junta de Andalucia [BIO-199]; Plan Nacional [SAF2010-20059]; European Union [TRYPOBASE] [223238]; Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council [1066263]; Medical Research Council [MR/K018779/1]","The OPPF-UK is funded by the Medical Research Council, UK (grant MR/K018779/1).

The increased availability of genomic and transcriptomic data for many understudied nematode species provides a great opportunity to investigate different aspects of their biology. Increasingly, metabolic potential of pathogens is recognized as a critical determinant governing their development, growth and pathogenicity. Comparing metabolic potential among species with distinct trophic ecologies can provide insights on overall biology or molecular adaptations. Furthermore, ascertaining gene expression at pathway level can help in understanding metabolic dynamics over development. Comparison of biochemical pathways (or subpathways, i.e. pathway modules) among related species can also retrospectively indicate potential mistakes in gene-calling and functional annotation. We show with numerous illustrative case studies that comparisons at the level of pathway modules have the potential to uncover biological insights while remaining computationally tractable. Here, we reconstruct and compare metabolic modules found in the deduced proteomes of 13 nematodes and 10 non-nematode species (including hosts of the parasitic nematode species). We observed that the metabolic potential is, in general, concomitant with phylogenetic and/or ecological similarity. Varied metabolic strategies are required among the nematodes, with only 8 out of 51 pathway modules being completely conserved. Enzyme comparison based on topology of metabolic modules uncovered diversification between parasite and host that can potentially guide therapeutic intervention. Gene expression data from 4 nematode species were used to study metabolic dynamics over their life cycles. We report unexpected differential metabolism between immature and mature microfilariae of the human filarial parasite Brugia malayi. A set of genes potentially important for parasitism is also reported, based on an analysis of gene expression in C. elegans and the human hookworm Necator americanus. We illustrate how analyzing and comparing metabolism at the level of pathway modules can improve existing knowledge of nematode metabolic potential and can provide parasitism related insights. Our reconstruction and comparison of nematode metabolic pathways at a pan-phylum and inter-phylum level enabled determination of phylogenetic restrictions and differential expression of pathways. A visualization of our results is available at http://nematode.net and the program for identification of module completeness (modDFS) is freely available at SourceForge. The methods reported will help biologists to predict biochemical potential of any organism with available deduced proteome, to direct experiments and test hypotheses.","[Tyagi, Rahul; Rosa, Bruce A.; Mitreva, Makedonka] Washington Univ, Sch Med, Genome Inst, St Louis, MO 63130 USA; [Lewis, Warren G.; Mitreva, Makedonka] Washington Univ, Sch Med, Dept Internal Med, Div Infect Dis, St Louis, MO 63110 USA; [Mitreva, Makedonka] Washington Univ, Sch Med, Dept Genet, St Louis, MO 63110 USA","Tyagi, R (reprint author), Washington Univ, Sch Med, Genome Inst, St Louis, MO 63130 USA.",mmitreva@genome.wustl.edu,"Lewis, Warren G/W-4369-2019","Lewis, Warren G/0000-0003-1210-6403; Tyagi, Rahul/0000-0002-6680-8972; Mitreva, Makedonka/0000-0001-9572-3436",National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (USA) [R01 AI081803],"This work was supported by a grant (R01 AI081803) by National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (USA) to MM.

Inadequate intake of nutrients due to food shortage may affect the immune system and influence the progression of infection to clinical leprosy. We aimed to identify possible differences in dietary intake between recently diagnosed leprosy patients and control subjects. Methods In a leprosy endemic area of Bangladesh, newly diagnosed leprosy patients and control subjects were interviewed about their socioeconomic situation, health and diet. Dietary intakes were recorded with a 24-hour recall, from which a Dietary Diversity Score (DDS) was calculated. Body Mass Index (BMI) was calculated and Household Food Insecurity Access Scale (HFIAS) was filled out for every participant. Using logistic regression, a univariate, block wise multivariate, and an integrated analysis were carried out. Results 52 leprosy cases and 100 control subjects were included. Food shortage was more common, dietary diversity was lower and household food insecurity was higher in the patient group. Patients consumed significantly less items from the DDS food groups 'Meat and fish' and 'Other fruits and vegetables.' Lower food expenditure per capita, lower BMI, lower DDS and absence of household food stocks are the main factors associated with an increased risk of having leprosy. Conclusion Low income families have only little money to spend on food and consequently have a low intake of highly nutritious non-rice foods such as meat, fish, milk, eggs, fruits and vegetables. Development of clinical leprosy could be explained by deficiencies of the nutrients that these foods normally provide.","[Wagenaar, Inge; Richardus, Jan Hendrik] Erasmus MC, Dept Publ Hlth, Rotterdam, Netherlands; [van Muiden, Lisanne] Univ Wageningen & Res Ctr, Wageningen, Netherlands; [Alam, Khorshed; Bowers, Robert] Leprosy Mission Int Bangladesh, Rural Hlth Program, Nilphamari, Bangladesh; [Hossain, Md.

We previously showed that Fibrinogen-like-protein 2 (FGL2), a novel CD4(+) CD25(+) Treg effector molecule, was over-expressed in the liver of mice experimentally infected with E. multilocularis. However, little is known about its contribution to the control of this chronic helminth infection. Methods/Findings Key parameters for infection outcome in E. multilocularis-infected fgl2(-/-) (AE-fgl2(-/-)) and wild type (AE-WT) mice at 1 and 4 month(s) post-infection were (i) parasite load (i.e. wet weight of parasitic metacestode tissue), and (ii) parasite cell proliferation as assessed by determining E. multilocularis 14-3-3 gene expression levels. Serum FGL2 levels were measured by ELISA. Spleen cells cultured with ConA for 48h or with E. multilocularis Vesicle Fluid (VF) for 96h were analyzed ex-vivo and in-vitro. In addition, spleen cells from non-infected WT mice were cultured with rFGL2/anti-FGL2 or rIL-17A/anti-IL-17A for further functional studies. For Treg-immune-suppression-assays, purified CD4(+) CD25(+) Treg suspensions were incubated with CD4(+) effector T cells in the presence of ConA and irradiated spleen cells as APCs. Flow cytometry and qRT-PCR were used to assess Treg, Th17-, Th1-, Th2-type immune responses and maturation of dendritic cells. We showed that AE-fgl2(-/-) mice exhibited (as compared to AE-WT-animals) (a) a significantly lower parasite load with reduced proliferation activity, (b) an increased T cell proliferative response to ConA, (c) reduced Treg numbers and function, and (d) a persistent capacity of Th1 polarization and DC maturation. Conclusions FGL2 appears as one of the key players in immune regulatory processes favoring metacestode survival by promoting Treg cell activity and IL-17A production that contributes to FGL2-regulation. Prospectively, targeting FGL2 could be an option to develop an immunotherapy against AE and other chronic parasitic diseases.","[Wang, Junhua; Mueller, Norbert; Hemphill, Andrew; Spiliotis, Markus; Gottstein, Bruno] Univ Bern, Inst Parasitol, Bern, Switzerland; [Wang, Junhua; Lu, Xiaomei; Lin, Renyong; Wen, Hao] Xinjiang Med Univ, Affiliated Hosp 1, State Key Lab Incubat Base Xinjiang Major Dis Res, Urumqi, Xinjiang, Peoples R China; [Wang, Junhua; Lu, Xiaomei; Lin, Renyong; Wen, Hao] Xinjiang Med Univ, Affiliated Hosp 1, Xinjiang Key Lab Echinococcosis, Urumqi, Xinjiang, Peoples R China; [Wang, Junhua; Blagosklonov, Oleg] Univ Franche Comte, Dept Nucl Med, F-25030 Besancon, Franche Comte, France; [Wang, Junhua; Blagosklonov, Oleg] Jean Minjoz Univ Hosp, Besancon, Franche Comte, France; [Vuitton, Dominique A.] Univ Franche Comte, World Hlth Org WHO Collaborating Ctr Prevent & Tr, F-25030 Besancon, Franche Comte, France; [Vuitton, Dominique A.] Univ Hosp, Besancon, Franche Comte, France; [Grandgirard, Denis; Leib, Stephen L.] Univ Bern, Inst Infect Dis, Neuroinfect Lab, Bern, Switzerland; [Leib, Stephen L.] FOCP, Div Biol, Spiez Lab, Spiez, Switzerland; [Shalev, Itay; Levy, Gary] Univ Toronto, Inst Transplantat, Toronto, ON, Canada","Wang, JH (reprint author), Univ Bern, Inst Parasitol, Bern, Switzerland.",bruno.gottstein@vetsuisse.unibe.ch,,"VUITTON, Dominique Angele/0000-0003-0043-3896; /0000-0002-1106-6123; Grandgirard, Denis/0000-0002-4151-5196","Swiss National Science Foundation [31003A_141039/1]; Natural Science Fundation of China (NSFC) [81260452, 81260252, U1303222]; European Commission French-Swiss InterReg IV program 'IsotopEchino' project; Program for Changjiang Scholars and Innovative Research Team in Universities [IRT1181]; Xinjiang Key-Lab Projects [SKLIB-XJMDR-2012-Y1]","This work was funded by: Swiss National Science Foundation (grant number 31003A_141039/1) [BG], Natural Science Fundation of China (NSFC) Grant Projects (grant numbers 81260452 [JW], 81260252 [RL], U1303222 [HW]), the European Commission French-Swiss InterReg IV program 'IsotopEchino' project [BG, DAV], the Program for Changjiang Scholars and Innovative Research Team in Universities (grant number IRT1181) [HW] and Xinjiang Key-Lab Projects (grant number SKLIB-XJMDR-2012-Y1) [JW].

In addition, public health agencies are scaling up efforts to test and deploy candidate vaccines. Given the experimental nature and limited initial supplies of vaccines, a mass vaccination campaign might not be feasible. However, ring vaccination of likely case contacts could provide an effective alternative in distributing the vaccine. To evaluate ring vaccination as a strategy for eliminating Ebola, we developed a pair approximation model of Ebola transmission, parameterized by confirmed incidence data from June 2014 to January 2015 in Liberia and Sierra Leone. Our results suggest that if a combined intervention of case isolation and ring vaccination had been initiated in the early fall of 2014, up to an additional 126 cases in Liberia and 560 cases in Sierra Leone could have been averted beyond case isolation alone. The marginal benefit of ring vaccination is predicted to be greatest in settings where there are more contacts per individual, greater clustering among individuals, when contact tracing has low efficacy or vaccination confers post-exposure protection. In such settings, ring vaccination can avert up to an additional 8% of Ebola cases. Accordingly, ring vaccination is predicted to offer a moderately beneficial supplement to ongoing non-pharmaceutical Ebola control efforts.","[Wells, Chad; Yamin, Dan; Ndeffo-Mbah, Martial L.; Wenzel, Natasha; Atkins, Katherine E.; Galvani, Alison P.] Yale Univ, Sch Publ Hlth, Ctr Infect Dis Modeling & Anal, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; [Gaffney, Stephen G.; Townsend, Jeffrey P.] Yale Univ, Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Biostat, New Haven, CT USA; [Townsend, Jeffrey P.; Galvani, Alison P.] Yale Univ, Program Computat Biol & Bioinformat, New Haven, CT USA; [Townsend, Jeffrey P.; Galvani, Alison P.] Yale Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, New Haven, CT USA; [Meyers, Lauren Ancel] Univ Texas Austin, Dept Integrat Biol, Austin, TX 78712 USA; [Meyers, Lauren Ancel] Santa Fe Inst, Santa Fe, NM 87501 USA; [Fallah, Mosoka; Nyenswah, Tolbert G.] Minist Hlth & Social Welf, Monrovia, Liberia; [Altice, Frederick L.] Yale Univ, Sch Med, Infect Dis Sect, New Haven, CT USA; [Altice, Frederick L.; Galvani, Alison P.] Yale Univ, Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Epidemiol Microbial Dis, New Haven, CT USA; [Atkins, Katherine E.] London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, Ctr Math Modelling Infect Dis, Dept Infect Dis Epidemiol, London WC1, England","Wells, C (reprint author), Yale Univ, Sch Publ Hlth, Ctr Infect Dis Modeling & Anal, New Haven, CT 06520 USA.",chad.wells@yale.edu,"Townsend, Jeffrey/H-2747-2019","Townsend, Jeffrey/0000-0002-9890-3907; Altice, Frederick/0000-0002-7860-693X; Meyers, Lauren/0000-0002-5828-8874; Gaffney, Stephen/0000-0002-5490-2945","National Institutes of Health [NIH U01 GM087719, U01 GM105627, K24 DA017072]; National Science Foundation [NSF RAPID 1514673]; Notsew Orm Sands Foundation","This work was funded by the following: APG LAM JPT: National Institutes of Health (NIH U01 GM087719, U01 GM105627).
