While neurons in the primary auditory cortex (AC) respond differentially to tones of different frequencies, whether and how AC regulates auditory behaviors that rely on frequency discrimination remains poorly understood. Here, we find that the level of activity of inhibitory neurons in AC controls frequency specificity in innate and learned auditory behaviors that rely on frequency discrimination. Photoactivation of parvalbumin-positive interneurons (PVs) improved the ability of the mouse to detect a shift in tone frequency, whereas photosuppression of PVs impaired the performance. Furthermore, photosuppression of PVs during discriminative auditory fear conditioning increased generalization of conditioned response across tone frequencies, whereas PV photoactivation preserved normal specificity of learning. The observed changes in behavioral performance were correlated with bidirectional changes in the magnitude of tone-evoked responses, consistent with predictions of a model of a coupled excitatory-inhibitory cortical network. Direct photoactivation of excitatory neurons, which did not change tone-evoked response magnitude, did not affect behavioral performance in either task. Our results identify a new function for inhibition in the auditory cortex, demonstrating that it can improve or impair acuity of innate and learned auditory behaviors that rely on frequency discrimination.","[Aizenberg, Mark; Mwilambwe-Tshilobo, Laetitia; Natan, Ryan G.; Geffen, Maria N.] Univ Penn, Neurosci Grad Grp, Dept Otorhinolaryngol HNS, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Briguglio, John J.] Univ Penn, Phys Grad Grp, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA","Aizenberg, M (reprint author), Univ Penn, Neurosci Grad Grp, Dept Otorhinolaryngol HNS, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.",mgeffen@med.upenn.edu,,"Natan, Ryan/0000-0002-3123-4833","NIH NIDCD [DC014479, 013660]; Klingenstein Fellowship in Neuroscience; Burroughs Wellcome Career Award at the Scientific Interface; Human Frontiers in Science Award; NARSAD young investigator AWARD; NSF [PHY1058202]; US-Israel BSF [2011058]","This work was supported by NIH NIDCD DC014479, 013660, Klingenstein Fellowship in Neuroscience; Burroughs Wellcome Career Award at the Scientific Interface, and by the Human Frontiers in Science Award to MNG.

In breast cancer, ELF5 is a key transcriptional determinant of tumor subtype and has been implicated in the development of insensitivity to anti-estrogen therapy. In the mouse mammary tumor virus-Polyoma Middle T (MMTV-PyMT) model of luminal breast cancer, induction of ELF5 levels increased leukocyte infiltration, angiogenesis, and blood vessel permeability in primary tumors and greatly increased the size and number of lung metastasis. Myeloid-derived suppressor cells, a group of immature neutrophils recently identified as mediators of vasculogenesis and metastasis, were recruited to the tumor in response to ELF5. Depletion of these cells using specific Ly6G antibodies prevented ELF5 from driving vasculogenesis and metastasis. Expression signatures in luminal A breast cancers indicated that increased myeloid cell invasion and inflammation were correlated with ELF5 expression, and increased ELF5 immunohistochemical staining predicted much shorter metastasis-free and overall survival of luminal A patients, defining a group who experienced unexpectedly early disease progression. Thus, in the MMTV-PyMT mouse mammary model, increased ELF5 levels drive metastasis by co-opting the innate immune system. As ELF5 has been previously implicated in the development of antiestrogen resistance, this finding implicates ELF5 as a defining factor in the acquisition of the key aspects of the lethal phenotype in luminal A breast cancer.","[Gallego-Ortega, David; Ledger, Anita; Roden, Daniel L.; Law, Andrew M.

EMT often associates with increased transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) signaling, and TGF-beta drives EMT, in part through Smad-mediated reprogramming of gene expression. TGF-beta also activates the Erk MAPK pathway through recruitment and Tyr phosphorylation of the adaptor protein ShcA by the activated TGF-beta type I receptor. We found that ShcA protects the epithelial integrity of nontransformed cells against EMT by repressing TGF-beta-induced, Smad-mediated gene expression. p52ShcA competed with Smad3 for TGF-beta receptor binding, and down-regulation of ShcA expression enhanced autocrine TGF-beta/Smad signaling and target gene expression, whereas increased p52ShcA expression resulted in decreased Smad3 binding to the TGF-beta receptor, decreased Smad3 activation, and increased Erk MAPK and Akt signaling. Furthermore, p52ShcA sequestered TGF-beta receptor complexes to caveolin-associated membrane compartments, and reducing ShcA expression enhanced the receptor localization in clathrin-associated membrane compartments that enable Smad activation. Consequently, silencing ShcA expression induced EMT, with increased cell migration, invasion, and dissemination, and increased stem cell generation and mammosphere formation, dependent upon autocrine TGF-beta signaling. These findings position ShcA as a determinant of the epithelial phenotype by repressing TGF-beta-induced Smad activation through differential partitioning of receptor complexes at the cell surface.","[Muthusamy, Baby Periyanayaki; Budi, Erine H.; Katsuno, Yoko; Derynck, Rik] Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Cell, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; [Muthusamy, Baby Periyanayaki; Budi, Erine H.; Katsuno, Yoko; Derynck, Rik] Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Tissue Biol, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; [Muthusamy, Baby Periyanayaki; Budi, Erine H.; Katsuno, Yoko; Akhurst, Rosemary J.; Derynck, Rik] Univ Calif San Francisco, Eli & Edythe Broad, Ctr Regenerat Med & Stem Cell Res, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; [Lee, Matthew K.; Smith, Susan M.] Univ So Calif, Ctr Craniofacial Mol Biol, Ostrow Sch Dent, 2250 Alcazar St, Los Angeles, CA 90033 USA; [Mirza, Amer M.] Xoma Corp, Berkeley, CA 94710 USA; [Akhurst, Rosemary J.; Derynck, Rik] Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Anat, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; [Akhurst, Rosemary J.; Derynck, Rik] Univ Calif San Francisco, Helen Diller Comprehens Canc Ctr, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA","Muthusamy, BP (reprint author), Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Cell, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA.; Muthusamy, BP (reprint author), Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Tissue Biol, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA.",rik.derynck@ucsf.edu,,,"NIH [CA136690, CA 63101, P50 CA58207, R21 CA164772]; NRSA postdoctoral fellowship [F32CA157109]; Juvenile Diabetes Research Fund [3-2012-214]; Japanese Society for Promotion of Science","NIH grants CA136690 and CA 63101 to RD provided overall funding to this project.

In the fly, the parasite's surface is covered with invariant procyclin, while in the mammal it resides extracellularly in its bloodstream form (BF) and is densely covered with highly immunogenic Variant Surface Glycoprotein (VSG). In the BF, the parasite varies this highly immunogenic surface VSG using a repertoire of similar to 2500 distinct VSG genes. Recent reports in mammalian systems point to a role for histone acetyl-lysine recognizing bromodomain proteins in the maintenance of stem cell fate, leading us to hypothesize that bromodomain proteins may maintain the BF cell fate in trypanosomes. Using small-molecule inhibitors and genetic mutants for individual bromodomain proteins, we performed RNA-seq experiments that revealed changes in the transcriptome similar to those seen in cells differentiating from the BF to the insect stage. This was recapitulated at the protein level by the appearance of insect-stage proteins on the cell surface. Furthermore, bromodomain inhibition disrupts two major BF-specific immune evasion mechanisms that trypanosomes harness to evade mammalian host antibody responses. First, monoallelic expression of the antigenically varied VSG is disrupted. Second, rapid internalization of antibodies bound to VSG on the surface of the trypanosome is blocked. Thus, our studies reveal a role for trypanosome bromodomain proteins in maintaining bloodstream stage identity and immune evasion. Importantly, bromodomain inhibition leads to a decrease in virulence in a mouse model of infection, establishing these proteins as potential therapeutic drug targets for trypanosomiasis. Our 1.25A resolution crystal structure of a trypanosome bromodomain in complex with I-BET151 reveals a novel binding mode of the inhibitor, which serves as a promising starting point for rational drug design.","[Schulz, Danae; Mugnier, Monica R.; Kim, Hee-Sook; Papavasiliou, F.

In plants, the RNaseIII enzyme DICER-LIKE1 (DCL1) produces miRNAs, whereas DCL2, DCL3, and DCL4 produce various size classes of siRNAs. Plants also encode RNASE THREE-LIKE (RTL) enzymes that lack DCL-specific domains and whose function is largely unknown. We found that virus infection induces RTL1 expression, suggesting that this enzyme could play a role in plant-virus interaction. To first investigate the biochemical activity of RTL1 independent of virus infection, small RNAs were sequenced from transgenic plants constitutively expressing RTL1. These plants lacked almost all DCL2-, DCL3-, and DCL4-dependent small RNAs, indicating that RTL1 is a general suppressor of plant siRNA pathways. In vivo and in vitro assays revealed that RTL1 prevents siRNA production by cleaving dsRNA prior to DCL2-, DCL3-, and DCL4-processing. The substrate of RTL1 cleavage is likely long-perfect (or near-perfect) dsRNA, consistent with the RTL1-insensitivity of miRNAs, which derive from DCL1-processing of short-imperfect dsRNA. Virus infection induces RTL1 mRNA accumulation, but viral proteins that suppress RNA silencing inhibit RTL1 activity, suggesting that RTL1 has evolved as an inducible antiviral defense that could target dsRNA intermediates of viral replication, but that a broad range of viruses counteract RTL1 using the same protein toolbox used to inhibit antiviral RNA silencing. Together, these results reveal yet another level of complexity in the evolutionary battle between viruses and plant defenses.","[Shamandi, Nahid; Elvira-Matelot, Emilie; Bochnakian, Aurore; Mallory, Allison C.; Lepere, Gersende; Vaucheret, Herve] Univ Paris Saclay, Inst Jean Pierre Bourgin, INRA AgroParisTech CNRS, UMR 1318, Versailles, France; [Shamandi, Nahid] Univ Paris Saclay, Univ Paris 11, Orsay, France; [Zytnicki, Matthias] INRA, URGI, F-78026 Versailles, France; [Charbonnel, Cyril; Comella, Pascale; Saez-Vasquez, Julio] CNRS, LGDP, UMR 5096, Perpignan, France; [Charbonnel, Cyril; Comella, Pascale; Saez-Vasquez, Julio] Univ Perpignan, LGDP, UMR 5096, Via Domitia, F-66025 Perpignan, France","Shamandi, N (reprint author), Univ Paris Saclay, Inst Jean Pierre Bourgin, INRA AgroParisTech CNRS, UMR 1318, Versailles, France.",herve.vaucheret@versailles.inra.fr,,"ELVIRA-MATELOT, EMILIE/0000-0002-4017-6436; VAUCHERET, HERVE/0000-0002-9986-0988; lepere, gersende/0000-0002-4609-7587","French Agence Nationale de la Recherche [ANR-10-LABX-40, ANR-11-BSV6-007]","This work was supported by grants from the French Agence Nationale de la Recherche: ANR-10-LABX-40 (to HV) and ANR-11-BSV6-007 (to HV, MZ, and JSV).

This regulation requires components of the synaptonemal complex (SC), a proteinaceous structure formed between homologous chromosomes. In yeast, SC formation requires the ""ZMM"" genes, which encode a functionally diverse set of proteins, including the transverse filament protein, Zip1. In wild-type meiosis, Zmm proteins promote the biased resolution of recombination intermediates into crossovers that are distributed throughout the genome by interference. In contrast, noncrossovers are formed primarily through synthesis-dependent strand annealing mediated by the Sgs1 helicase. This work identifies a conserved region on the C terminus of Zip1 (called Zip1 4S), whose phosphorylation is required for the ZMM pathway of crossover formation. Zip1 4S phosphorylation is promoted both by double-strand breaks (DSBs) and the meiosis-specific kinase, MEK1/MRE4, demonstrating a role for MEK1 in the regulation of interhomolog crossover formation, as well as interhomolog bias. Failure to phosphorylate Zip1 4S results in meiotic prophase arrest, specifically in the absence of SGS1. This gain of function meiotic arrest phenotype is suppressed by spo11 Delta, suggesting that it is due to unrepaired breaks triggering the meiotic recombination checkpoint. Epistasis experiments combining deletions of individual ZMM genes with sgs1-md zip1-4A indicate that Zip1 4S phosphorylation functions prior to the other ZMMs. These results suggest that phosphorylation of Zip1 at DSBs commits those breaks to repair via the ZMM pathway and provides a mechanism by which the crossover/ noncrossover decision can be dynamically regulated during yeast meiosis.","[Chen, Xiangyu; Suhandynata, Ray T.; Rockmill, Beth; Lo, Hsiao-Chi; Hollingsworth, Nancy M.] SUNY Stony Brook, Biochem & Cell Biol, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA; [Sandhu, Rima; Borner, G.

Larval parasitoids constitute clear danger to Drosophila, as up to 80% of fly larvae become parasitized in nature. We show that Drosophila melanogaster larvae and adults avoid sites smelling of the main parasitoid enemies, Leptopilina wasps. This avoidance is mediated via a highly specific olfactory sensory neuron (OSN) type. While the larval OSN expresses the olfactory receptor Or49a and is tuned to the Leptopilina odor iridomyrmecin, the adult expresses both Or49a and Or85f and in addition detects the wasp odors actinidine and nepetalactol. The information is transferred via projection neurons to a specific part of the lateral horn known to be involved in mediating avoidance. Drosophila has thus developed a dedicated circuit to detect a lifethreatening enemy based on the smell of its semiochemicals. Such an enemy-detecting olfactory circuit has earlier only been characterized in mice and nematodes.","[Ebrahim, Shimaa A. M.; Dweck, Hany K.

Currently, we know more about how future climates are likely to shift across the globe than about how species will respond to these changes. Two recent studies show how mesocosm experiments can hasten understanding of the ecological consequences of climate change on species' extinction risk, community structure, and ecosystem functions. Using a large-scale terrestrial warming experiment, Bestion et al. provide the first direct evidence that future global warming can increase extinction risk for temperate ectotherms. Using aquatic mesocosms, YvonDurocher et al. show that human-induced climate change could, in some cases, actually enhance the diversity of local communities, increasing productivity.

Recent work suggests that metformin directly antagonizes cancer cell growth through its actions on complex I of the mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC). However, the mechanisms by which metformin arrests cancer cell proliferation remain poorly defined. Here we demonstrate that the metabolic checkpoint kinases AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and LKB1 are not required for the antiproliferative effects of metformin. Rather, metformin inhibits cancer cell proliferation by suppressing mitochondrial-dependent biosynthetic activity. We show that in vitro metformin decreases the flow of glucose-and glutamine-derived metabolic intermediates into the Tricarboxylic Acid (TCA) cycle, leading to reduced citrate production and de novo lipid biosynthesis. Tumor cells lacking functional mitochondria maintain lipid biosynthesis in the presence of metformin via glutamine-dependent reductive carboxylation, and display reduced sensitivity to metformin-induced proliferative arrest. Our data indicate that metformin inhibits cancer cell proliferation by suppressing the production of mitochondrial-dependent metabolic intermediates required for cell growth, and that metabolic adaptations that bypass mitochondrial-dependent biosynthesis may provide a mechanism of tumor cell resistance to biguanide activity.","[Griss, Takla; Vincent, Emma E.; Chen, Jocelyn; Ma, Eric H.; Faubert, Brandon; Jones, Russell G.] McGill Univ, Goodman Canc Res Ctr, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Griss, Takla; Vincent, Emma E.; Chen, Jocelyn; Ma, Eric H.; Faubert, Brandon; Jones, Russell G.] McGill Univ, Dept Physiol, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Egnatchik, Robert; DeBerardinis, Ralph J.] Univ Texas SW Med Ctr Dallas, Res Inst, Childrens Med Ctr, Dallas, TX 75390 USA; [Egnatchik, Robert; DeBerardinis, Ralph J.] Univ Texas SW Med Ctr Dallas, McDermott Ctr Human Growth & Dev, Dallas, TX 75390 USA; [Egnatchik, Robert; DeBerardinis, Ralph J.] Univ Texas SW Med Ctr Dallas, Harold C Simmons Comprehens Canc Ctr, Dallas, TX 75390 USA; [Viollet, Benoit] INSERM, Inst Cochin, U1016, Paris, France; [Viollet, Benoit] CNRS, UMR 8104, Paris, France; [Viollet, Benoit] Univ Paris 05, Sorbonne Paris Cite, Paris, France","Griss, T (reprint author), McGill Univ, Goodman Canc Res Ctr, Montreal, PQ, Canada.",russell.jones@mcgill.ca,"Viollet, Benoit/N-2397-2019; Viollet, Benoit/O-6927-2017","Viollet, Benoit/0000-0002-0121-0224; Viollet, Benoit/0000-0002-0121-0224; Faubert, Brandon/0000-0002-2886-886X; Vincent, Emma/0000-0002-8917-7384",National Institutes of Health [CA157996]; Canadian Institutes of Health Research [MOP-93799]; Terry Fox Foundation [TFRI-239585]; Cancer Research Society [19312],"This research was supported by research grants from the National Institutes of Health (CA157996, RJD), Canadian Institutes of Health Research (MOP-93799, RGJ), Terry Fox Foundation (TFRI-239585, RGJ), and Cancer Research Society (#19312, RGJ).

The causes of this bias are commonly discussed in the context of sexual antagonism and the avoidance of activity in the male germline. Here, we examine the notion that, at least in some taxa, functionally biased gene content may more profoundly be shaped by limits imposed on gene expression owing to haploid expression of the X chromosome. Notably, if the X, as in primates, is transcribed at rates comparable to the ancestral rate (per promoter) prior to the X chromosome formation, then the X is not a tolerable environment for genes with very high maximal net levels of expression, owing to transcriptional traffic jams. We test this hypothesis using The Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) and data from the Functional Annotation of the Mammalian Genome (FANTOM5) project. As predicted, the maximal expression of human X-linked genes is much lower than that of genes on autosomes: on average, maximal expression is three times lower on the X chromosome than on autosomes. Similarly, autosome-to-X retroposition events are associated with lower maximal expression of retrogenes on the X than seen for X-to-autosome retrogenes on autosomes. Also as expected, X-linked genes have a lesser degree of increase in gene expression than autosomal ones (compared to the human/Chimpanzee common ancestor) if highly expressed, but not if lowly expressed. The traffic jam model also explains the known lower breadth of expression for genes on the X (and the Z of birds), as genes with broad expression are, on average, those with high maximal expression. As then further predicted, highly expressed tissue-specific genes are also rare on the X and broadly expressed genes on the X tend to be lowly expressed, both indicating that the trend is shaped by the maximal expression level not the breadth of expression per se. Importantly, a limit to the maximal expression level explains biased tissue of expression profiles of X-linked genes. Tissues whose tissue-specific genes are very highly expressed (e.g., secretory tissues, tissues abundant in structural proteins) are also tissues in which gene expression is relatively rare on the X chromosome. These trends cannot be fully accounted for in terms of alternative models of biased expression. In conclusion, the notion that it is hard for genes on the Therian X to be highly expressed, owing to transcriptional traffic jams, provides a simple yet robustly supported rationale of many peculiar features of X's gene content, gene expression, and evolution.","[Hurst, Laurence D.; Ghanbarian, Avazeh T.] Univ Bath, Dept Biol & Biochem, Milner Ctr Evolut, Bath BA2 7AY, Avon, England; [Forrest, Alistair R.

Here, we designed a model-based functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) experiment in which subjects adapted to two opposing visuomotor rotations. A computational model of motor adaptation with multiple memories was fitted to the behavioral data to generate time-varying regressors of brain activity. We identified regional specificity to timescales: in particular, the activity in the inferior parietal region and in the anterior-medial cerebellum was associated with memories for intermediate and long timescales, respectively. A sparse singular value decomposition analysis of variability in specificities to timescales over the brain identified four components, two fast, one middle, and one slow, each associated with different brain networks. Finally, a multivariate decoding analysis showed that activity patterns in the anterior-medial cerebellum progressively represented the two rotations. Our results support the existence of brain regions associated with multiple timescales in adaptation and a role of the cerebellum in storing multiple internal models.","[Kim, Sungshin] Univ So Calif, Neurosci Grad Program, Los Angeles, CA USA; [Kim, Sungshin] Northwestern Univ, Feinberg Sch Med, Chicago, IL 60611 USA; [Ogawa, Kenji; Imamizu, Hiroshi] Adv Telecommun Res Inst Int, Cognit Mech Labs, Keihanna Sci City, Kyoto, Japan; [Ogawa, Kenji] Hokkaido Univ, Grad Sch Letters, Dept Psychol, Sapporo, Hokkaido, Japan; [Lv, Jinchi] Univ So Calif, Marshall Sch Business, Data Sci & Operat Dept, Los Angeles, CA USA; [Schweighofer, Nicolas] Univ So Calif, Div Biokinesiol & Phys Therapy, Los Angeles, CA USA; [Schweighofer, Nicolas] Univ Montpellier I, EuroMov, Movement Hlth Lab M2H, Montpellier, France; [Imamizu, Hiroshi] Natl Inst Informat & Commun Technol, Ctr Informat & Neural Networks, Suita, Osaka, Japan; [Imamizu, Hiroshi] Osaka Univ, Suita, Osaka, Japan; [Imamizu, Hiroshi] Univ Tokyo, Dept Psychol, Grad Sch Humanities & Sociol, Tokyo, Japan","Kim, S (reprint author), Univ So Calif, Neurosci Grad Program, Los Angeles, CA USA.",schweigh@usc.edu,"Lv, Jinchi/D-2295-2012","Imamizu, Hiroshi/0000-0003-1024-0051; Ogawa, Kenji/0000-0003-3556-1038",NSF CAREER Award [DMS-0955316]; JSPS KAKENHI [26120002];  [NSF BCS 1031899],"Grant NSF BCS 1031899 to NS supported the behavioral experiment, computational modeling, and model-based fMRI part of this study. http://www.nsf.gov/div/index.jsp?div=bcs.

However, the development of intrinsic brain network organization and its relationship to observed improvements in cognitive control are not well understood. In the present study, we used resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (RS-fMRI), graph theory, the antisaccade task, and rigorous head motion control to characterize and relate developmental changes in network organization, connectivity strength, and integration to inhibitory control development. Subjects were 192 10-26-y-olds who were imaged during 5 min of rest. In contrast to initial studies, our results indicate that network organization is stable throughout adolescence. However, cross-network integration, predominantly of the cingulo-opercular/salience network, increased with age. Importantly, this increased integration of the cingulo-opercular/salience network significantly moderated the robust effect of age on the latency to initiate a correct inhibitory control response. These results provide compelling evidence that the transition to adult-level inhibitory control is dependent upon the refinement and strengthening of integration between specialized networks. Our findings support a novel, two-stage model of neural development, in which networks stabilize prior to adolescence and subsequently increase their integration to support the cross-domain incorporation of information processing critical for mature cognitive control.","[Marek, Scott; Luna, Beatriz] Univ Pittsburgh, Ctr Neurosci, Pittsburgh, PA 15260 USA; [Marek, Scott; Luna, Beatriz] Carnegie Mellon Univ, Ctr Neural Basis Cognit, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA; [Hwang, Kai] Univ Calif Berkeley, Helen Wills Neurosci Inst, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Foran, William; Hallquist, Michael N.; Luna, Beatriz] Univ Pittsburgh, Dept Psychiat, Pittsburgh, PA USA; [Hallquist, Michael N.] Penn State Univ, Dept Psychol, State Coll, PA USA; [Luna, Beatriz] Univ Pittsburgh, Dept Psychol, Pittsburgh, PA 15260 USA","Marek, S (reprint author), Univ Pittsburgh, Ctr Neurosci, Pittsburgh, PA 15260 USA.; Marek, S (reprint author), Carnegie Mellon Univ, Ctr Neural Basis Cognit, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA.",sam263@pitt.edu,,,National Institute of Mental Health [MH080243],"This work was supported by the National Institute of Mental Health (MH080243), awarded to BL.

But how symbionts evolve and, particularly, whether they undergo natural selection to benefit hosts are complex issues that are associated with several misconceptions about evolutionary processes in host-associated microbial communities. Microorganisms can have intimate, ancient, and/or mutualistic associations with hosts without having undergone natural selection to benefit hosts. Likewise, observing host-specific microbial community composition or greater community similarity among more closely related hosts does not imply that symbionts have coevolved with hosts, let alone that they have evolved for the benefit of the host. Although selection at the level of the symbiotic community, or hologenome, occurs in some cases, it should not be accepted as the null hypothesis for explaining features of host-symbiont associations.","[Moran, Nancy A.] Univ Texas Austin, Dept Integrat Biol, Austin, TX 78712 USA; [Sloan, Daniel B.] Colorado State Univ, Dept Biol, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA","Moran, NA (reprint author), Univ Texas Austin, Dept Integrat Biol, Austin, TX 78712 USA.",nancy.moran@austin.utexas.edu,,"Sloan, Daniel/0000-0002-3618-0897","National Institutes of Health [GM108477]; National Science Foundation [IOS1415604, MCB1412260]","The authors received support from the following three awards while writing this paper: National Institutes of Health GM108477 (NAM), National Science Foundation IOS1415604 (NAM), National Science Foundation MCB1412260 (DBS).

Our outdoor mesocosm experiment was open to natural dispersal from the regional species pool, allowing us to explore the effects of experimental warming in the context of metacommunity dynamics. Warming of 4 degrees C led to a 67% increase in the species richness of the phytoplankton, more evenly-distributed abundance, and higher rates of gross primary productivity. Warming elevated productivity indirectly, by increasing the biodiversity and biomass of the local phytoplankton communities. Warming also systematically shifted the taxonomic and functional trait composition of the phytoplankton, favoring large, colonial, inedible phytoplankton taxa, suggesting stronger top-down control, mediated by zooplankton grazing played an important role. Overall, our findings suggest that temperature can modulate species coexistence, and through such mechanisms, global warming could, in some cases, increase the species richness and productivity of phytoplankton communities.","[Yvon-Durocher, Gabriel; Gaston, Kevin J.] Univ Exeter, Environm & Sustainabil Inst, Penryn, Cornwall, England; [Yvon-Durocher, Gabriel; Dossena, Matteo; Woodward, Guy; Trimmer, Mark] Queen Mary Univ London, Sch Biol & Chem Sci, London, England; [Allen, Andrew P.] Macquarie Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Sydney, NSW 2109, Australia; [Cellamare, Maria; Leitao, Maria] Bi Eau, Angers, France; [Montoya, Jose M.] CNRS, Stn Expt Moulis, Ecol Networks & Global Change Grp, Moulis, France; [Montoya, Jose M.] CREAF, Ctr Ecol Res & Forestry Applicat, Cerdanyola De Valles, Spain; [Reuman, Daniel C.] Univ Kansas, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol & Kansas Biol Surve, Lawrence, KS 66045 USA; [Reuman, Daniel C.] Rockefeller Univ, Lab Populat, 1230 York Ave, New York, NY 10021 USA; [Woodward, Guy] Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Dept Life Sci, Ascot, Berks, England","Yvon-Durocher, G (reprint author), Univ Exeter, Environm & Sustainabil Inst, Penryn, Cornwall, England.",g.yvon-durocher@exeter.ac.uk,"Yvon, Dominique/D-2280-2015","Gaston, Kevin J./0000-0002-7235-7928; Allen, Andrew/0000-0003-0304-7544; Montoya, Jose M./0000-0002-6676-7592","NERC standard grant [NE/H022511/1]; Natural Environment Research Council [NE/H020705/1, NE/H022511/1]","This work was supported by a NERC standard grant (NE/H022511/1) awarded to MT, GYD, DCR, and GW.

Here, we demonstrate a novel mechanism by which persistent neuronal activity can be generated without feedback, relying instead on the slow removal of Na+ from neurons following bursts of activity. We show that mitral cells in the accessory olfactory bulb (AOB), which plays a major role in mammalian social behavior, may respond to a brief sensory stimulation with persistent firing. By combining electrical recordings, Ca2+ and Na+ imaging, and realistic computational modeling, we explored the mechanisms underlying the persistent activity in AOB mitral cells. We found that the exceptionally slow inward current that underlies this activity is governed by prolonged dynamics of intracellular Na+ ([Na+](i)), which affects neuronal electrical activity via several pathways. Specifically, elevated dendritic [Na+](i) reverses the Na+-Ca2+ exchanger activity, thus modifying the [Ca2+](i) set-point. This process, which relies on ubiquitous membrane mechanisms, is likely to play a role in other neuronal types in various brain regions.","[Zylbertal, Asaph; Yarom, Yosef] Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Inst Life Sci, Dept Neurobiol, IL-91904 Jerusalem, Israel; [Zylbertal, Asaph; Yarom, Yosef] Edmond & Lily Safra Ctr Brain Sci, IL-91904 Jerusalem, Israel; [Kahan, Anat; Ben-Shaul, Yoram] Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Sch Med, Dept Med Neurobiol, IL-91904 Jerusalem, Israel; [Wagner, Shlomo] Univ Haifa, Sagol Dept Neurobiol, IL-31999 Haifa, Israel","Zylbertal, A (reprint author), Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Inst Life Sci, Dept Neurobiol, IL-91904 Jerusalem, Israel.",asaph.zylbertal@mail.huji.ac.il,,"Zylbertal, Asaph/0000-0002-9789-2468; Wagner, Shlomo/0000-0002-7618-0752",Israel Science Foundation [1350/12]; Gatsby Charitable Foundation,"This work was supported by the Israel Science Foundation (http://www.isf.org.il/) grant #1350/12, received by Shlomo Wagner and the Gatsby Charitable Foundation (http://www.gatsby.org.uk/).

While CBD-A in RI alpha is required for PKA inhibition and activation, CBD-B functions as a ""gatekeeper"" domain that modulates the control exerted by CBD-A. Preliminary evidence suggests that CBD-B dynamics are critical for its gatekeeper function. To test this hypothesis, here we investigate by Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) the two-domain construct RI alpha (91-379) in its apo, cAMP(2), and C-bound forms. Our comparative NMR analyses lead to a double conformational selection model in which each apo CBD dynamically samples both active and inactive states independently of the adjacent CBD within a nearly degenerate free energy landscape. Such degeneracy is critical to explain the sensitivity of CBD-B to weak interactions with C and its high affinity for cAMP. Binding of cAMP eliminates this degeneracy, as it selectively stabilizes the active conformation within each CBD and inter-CBD contacts, which require both cAMP and W260. The latter is contributed by CBD-B and mediates capping of the cAMP bound to CBD-A. The inter-CBD interface is dispensable for intra-CBD conformational selection, but is indispensable for full activation of PKA as it occludes C-subunit recognition sites within CBD-A. In addition, the two structurally homologous cAMP-bound CBDs exhibit marked differences in their residual dynamics profiles, supporting the notion that conservation of structure does not necessarily imply conservation of dynamics.","[Akimoto, Madoka; Ramkissoon, Avinash; Moleschi, Kody; Melacini, Giuseppe] McMaster Univ, Dept Chem & Chem Biol, Hamilton, ON, Canada; [McNicholl, Eric Tyler; Melacini, Giuseppe] McMaster Univ, Dept Biochem & Biomed Sci, Hamilton, ON L8N 3Z5, Canada; [Taylor, Susan S.] Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Chem & Biochem, Dept Pharmacol, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Taylor, Susan S.] Univ Calif San Diego, Howard Hughes Med Inst, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA","Akimoto, M (reprint author), McMaster Univ, Dept Chem & Chem Biol, Hamilton, ON, Canada.",melacin@mcmaster.ca,,,Canadian Institutes of Health Research [MOP-68897]; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada [RGPIN-2014-04514]; National Institutes of Health [R01-GM034921],"This study received funding from Canadian Institutes of Health Research (grant number: MOP-68897 http://www.cihr-irsc.gs.ca/e/193.html) to GM, Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (grant number: RGPIN-2014-04514 http://www.nserc-crsng.gc.ca/index_eng.asp) to GM, and National Institutes of Health (grant number: R01-GM034921 http://www.nih.gov/) to SST.

The parasite expresses a novel enzyme PtdThr synthase (TgPTS) to produce this lipid in its endoplasmic reticulum. Genetic disruption of TgPTS abrogates de novo synthesis of PtdThr and impairs the lytic cycle and virulence of T. gondii. The observed phenotype is caused by a reduced gliding motility, which blights the parasite egress and ensuing host cell invasion. Notably, the PTS mutant can prevent acute as well as yet-incurable chronic toxoplasmosis in a mouse model, which endorses its potential clinical utility as a metabolically attenuated vaccine.

We identified that RNA targets of Puf3 orthologs have been conserved over 100-500 million years of evolution in five eukaryotic lineages. Focusing on Puf proteins and their targets across 80 fungi, we constructed a parsimonious model for their evolutionary history. This model entails extensive and coordinated changes in the Puf targets as well as changes in the number of Puf genes and alterations of RNA binding specificity including that: 1) Binding of Puf3 to more than 200 RNAs whose protein products are predominantly involved in the production and organization of mitochondrial complexes predates the origin of budding yeasts and filamentous fungi and was maintained for 500 million years, throughout the evolution of budding yeast. 2) In filamentous fungi, remarkably, more than 150 of the ancestral Puf3 targets were gained by Puf4, with one lineage maintaining both Puf3 and Puf4 as regulators and a sister lineage losing Puf3 as a regulator of these RNAs. The decrease in gene expression of these mRNAs upon deletion of Puf4 in filamentous fungi (N. crassa) in contrast to the increase upon Puf3 deletion in budding yeast (S. cerevisiae) suggests that the output of the RNA regulatory network is different with Puf4 in filamentous fungi than with Puf3 in budding yeast. 3) The coregulated Puf4 target set in filamentous fungi expanded to include mitochondrial genes involved in the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and other nuclear-encoded RNAs with mitochondrial function not bound by Puf3 in budding yeast, observations that provide additional evidence for substantial rewiring of post-transcriptional regulation. 4) Puf3 also expanded and diversified its targets in filamentous fungi, gaining interactions with the mRNAs encoding the mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC) complex I as well as hundreds of other mRNAs with nonmitochondrial functions. The many concerted and conserved changes in the RNA targets of Puf proteins strongly support an extensive role of RNA binding proteins in coordinating gene expression, as originally proposed by Keene. Rewiring of Puf-coordinated mRNA targets and transcriptional control of the same genes occurred at different points in evolution, suggesting that there have been distinct adaptations via RNA binding proteins and transcription factors. The changes in Puf targets and in the Puf proteins indicate an integral involvement of RNA binding proteins and their RNA targets in the adaptation, reprogramming, and function of gene expression.","[Hogan, Gregory J.; Brown, Patrick O.; Herschlag, Daniel] Stanford Univ, Dept Biochem, Sch Med, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Hogan, Gregory J.; Brown, Patrick O.] Stanford Univ, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Sch Med, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Herschlag, Daniel] Stanford Univ, Dept Chem, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Herschlag, Daniel] Stanford Univ, Dept Chem Engn, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Herschlag, Daniel] Stanford Univ, ChEM H Inst, Stanford, CA 94305 USA","Hogan, GJ (reprint author), Counsyl, San Francisco, CA USA.",pbrown@stanford.edu; herschla@stanford.edu,,,"National Institutes of Health (NIH) [RO1 CA77097, PO1 066275]; Burt and Deedee McMurtry Stanford Graduate Fellowship; Howard Hughes Medical Institute","This work was supported by grants from the National Institutes of Health (NIH RO1 CA77097 to P.O.B. and PO1 066275 to DH).

To investigate how organisms mitigate the deleterious effects of protein synthesis errors during evolution, a mutant yeast strain was engineered to translate a codon ambiguously (mistranslation). It thereby overloads the protein quality-control pathways and disrupts cellular protein homeostasis. This strain was used to study the capacity of the yeast genome to compensate the deleterious effects of protein mistranslation. Laboratory evolutionary experiments revealed that fitness loss due to mistranslation can rapidly be mitigated. Genomic analysis demonstrated that adaptation was primarily mediated by large-scale chromosomal duplication and deletion events, suggesting that errors during protein synthesis promote the evolution of genome architecture. By altering the dosages of numerous, functionally related proteins simultaneously, these genetic changes introduced large phenotypic leaps that enabled rapid adaptation to mistranslation. Evolution increased the level of tolerance to mistranslation through acceleration of ubiquitin-proteasome mediated protein degradation and protein synthesis. As a consequence of rapid elimination of erroneous protein products, evolution reduced the extent of toxic protein aggregation in mistranslating cells. However, there was a strong evolutionary trade-off between adaptation to mistranslation and survival upon starvation: the evolved lines showed fitness defects and impaired capacity to degrade mature ribosomes upon nutrient limitation. Moreover, as a response to an enhanced energy demand of accelerated protein turnover, the evolved lines exhibited increased glucose uptake by selective duplication of hexose transporter genes. We conclude that adjustment of proteome homeostasis to mistranslation evolves rapidly, but this adaptation has several side effects on cellular physiology. Our work also indicates that translational fidelity and the ubiquitin-proteasome system are functionally linked to each other and may, therefore, co-evolve in nature.","[Kalapis, Dorottya; Farkas, Zoltan; Horvath, Peter; Bodi, Zoltan; Daraba, Andreea; Szamecz, Bela; Pal, Csaba] Hungarian Acad Sci, Biol Res Ctr, Inst Biochem, Synthet & Syst Biol Unit, Szeged, Hungary; [Bezerra, Ana R.; Santos, Manuel A.

The molecular events underlying these effects are incompletely characterized. Similarly, the mechanisms underlying effects of factors that reduce the impact of aging on the brain, such as physical exercise, are also opaque.

The ontogeny of this multisensory interplay is still unknown. Here, we identify critical factors that control the development of visual-tactile processing by combining in vivo electrophysiology with anatomical/functional assessment of cortico-cortical communication and behavioral investigation of pigmented rats. We demonstrate that the transient reduction of unimodal (tactile) inputs during a short period of neonatal development prior to the first cross-modal experience affects feed-forward subcortico-cortical interactions by attenuating the cross-modal enhancement of evoked responses in the adult primary somatosensory cortex. Moreover, the neonatal manipulation alters cortico-cortical interactions by decreasing the cross-modal synchrony and directionality in line with the sparsification of direct projections between primary somatosensory and visual cortices. At the behavioral level, these functional and structural deficits resulted in lower cross-modal matching abilities. Thus, neonatal unimodal experience during defined developmental stages is necessary for setting up the neuronal networks of multisensory processing.","[Sieben, Kay; Bieler, Malte; Hanganu-Opatz, Ileana L.] Univ Med Ctr Hamburg Eppendorf, Inst Neuroanat, Dev Neurophysiol, Hamburg, Germany; [Roeder, Brigitte] Univ Hamburg, Biol Psychol & Neuropsychol, Hamburg, Germany","Sieben, K (reprint author), Univ Med Ctr Hamburg Eppendorf, Inst Neuroanat, Dev Neurophysiol, Hamburg, Germany.",kay.sieben@zmnh.uni-hamburg.de; hangop@zmnh.uni-hamburg.de,,,"excellence initiative of city Hamburg; German Research Foundation [Ha4466110-1, SPP 1665, SFB 936 B5]","This work was funded by grants from the excellence initiative of city Hamburg (""neurodapt!"" to KS, BR, and ILHO), German Research Foundation (www.dfg.de - Ha4466110-1 and SPP 1665 to ILHO as well as SFB 936 B5 to ILHO).

The development and persistence of IgE responses are poorly understood, which is in part due to the low number of IgE-producing cells. Here, we used next generation sequencing to uncover a striking overlap between the IgE and IgG1 repertoires in helminth-infected or OVA/alum-immunized wild-type BALB/c mice. The memory IgE response after secondary infection induced a strong increase of IgE(+) plasma cells in spleen and lymph nodes. In contrast, germinal center B cells did not increase during secondary infection. Unexpectedly, the memory IgE response was lost in mice where the extracellular part of IgG1 had been replaced with IgE sequences. Adoptive transfer studies revealed that IgG1(+) B cells were required and sufficient to constitute the memory IgE response in recipient mice. T cell-derived IL-4/IL-13 was required for the memory IgE response but not for expansion of B cells from memory mice. Together, our results reveal a close relationship between the IgE and IgG1 repertoires in vivo and demonstrate that the memory IgE response is mainly conserved at the level of memory IgG1(+) B cells. Therefore, targeting the generation and survival of allergen-specific IgG1(+) B cells could lead to development of new therapeutic strategies to treat chronic allergic disorders.","[Turqueti-Neves, Adriana; Otte, Manuel; Schwartz, Christian; Schmitt, Michaela Erika Renate; Voehringer, David] Univ Hosp Erlangen, Inst Clin Microbiol Immunol & Hyg, Dept Infect Biol, Erlangen, Germany; [Turqueti-Neves, Adriana; Otte, Manuel; Schwartz, Christian; Schmitt, Michaela Erika Renate; Voehringer, David] Univ Erlangen Nurnberg, D-91054 Erlangen, Germany; [Lindner, Cornelia; Pabst, Oliver] Hannover Med Sch, Inst Immunol, Hannover, Germany; [Pabst, Oliver] RWTH Univ, Fac Med, Inst Mol Med, Aachen, Germany; [Yu, Philipp] Univ Marburg, Inst Immunol, D-35032 Marburg, Germany","Turqueti-Neves, A (reprint author), Univ Hosp Erlangen, Inst Clin Microbiol Immunol & Hyg, Dept Infect Biol, Erlangen, Germany.",david.voehringer@uk-erlangen.de,"Voehringer, David/K-2776-2019; Pabst, Oliver/H-5014-2016; Schwartz, Christian/K-3716-2015","Pabst, Oliver/0000-0002-5533-883X; Schwartz, Christian/0000-0002-7084-268X",European Research Council [PAS 241506]; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft [TRR130_TP20],"This work was supported by a starting grant from the European Research Council to DV (PAS 241506) and by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (TRR130_TP20).

Bats have evolved an impressive capacity to control their flight, in large part due to their ability to modulate wing shape, area, and angle of attack through many independently controlled joints. Bat wings, however, also contain many bones and relatively large muscles, and thus the ratio of bats' wing mass to their body mass is larger than it is for all other extant flyers. Although the inertia in bat wings would typically be associated with decreased aerial maneuverability, we show that bat maneuvers challenge this notion. We use a model-based tracking algorithm to measure the wing and body kinematics of bats performing complex aerial rotations. Using a minimal model of a bat with only six degrees of kinematic freedom, we show that bats can perform body rolls by selectively retracting one wing during the flapping cycle. We also show that this maneuver does not rely on aerodynamic forces, and furthermore that a fruit fly, with nearly massless wings, would not exhibit this effect. Similar results are shown for a pitching maneuver. Finally, we combine high-resolution kinematics of wing and body movements during landing and falling maneuvers with a 52-degree-of-freedom dynamical model of a bat to show that modulation of wing inertia plays the dominant role in reorienting the bat during landing and falling maneuvers, with minimal contribution from aerodynamic forces. Bats can, therefore, use their wings as multifunctional organs, capable of sophisticated aerodynamic and inertial dynamics not previously observed in other flying animals. This may also have implications for the control of aerial robotic vehicles.","[Bergou, Attila J.; Swartz, Sharon M.; Vejdani, Hamid; Taubin, Gabriel; Breuer, Kenneth S.] Brown Univ, Sch Engn, Providence, RI 02912 USA; [Swartz, Sharon M.; Riskin, Daniel K.; Reimnitz, Lauren; Breuer, Kenneth S.] Brown Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Providence, RI 02912 USA","Bergou, AJ (reprint author), Brown Univ, Sch Engn, Providence, RI 02912 USA.",kbreuer@brown.edu,"Swartz, Sharon/B-9309-2011; Breuer, Kenneth/P-7753-2016","Swartz, Sharon/0000-0001-5762-7435; Breuer, Kenneth/0000-0002-5122-2231; Vejdani, Hamid/0000-0001-5352-9846; Taubin, Gabriel/0000-0002-1983-7607","AFOSR MURI program on Bio-inspired flight; AFOSR [FA9550-12-1-0210 DEF]; NSF [CCF-0729126, IIS-0808718, IOS-0723392, IOS-1145549, CCF-0915661]","This work was supported by the AFOSR MURI program on Bio-inspired flight, AFOSR grant FA9550-12-1-0210 DEF, and NSF grants numbers CCF-0729126, IIS-0808718, IOS-0723392, IOS-1145549 and CCF-0915661.

It is a longstanding goal to predict rates of resistance evolution and design optimal treatment strategies accordingly. To this end, it is crucial to reveal the underlying causes of drug-specific differences in the evolutionary dynamics leading to resistance. However, it remains largely unknown why the rates of resistance evolution via spontaneous mutations and the diversity of mutational paths vary substantially between drugs. Here we comprehensively quantify the distribution of fitness effects (DFE) of mutations, a key determinant of evolutionary dynamics, in the presence of eight antibiotics representing the main modes of action. Using precise high-throughput fitness measurements for genome-wide Escherichia coli gene deletion strains, we find that the width of the DFE varies dramatically between antibiotics and, contrary to conventional wisdom, for some drugs the DFE width is lower than in the absence of stress. We show that this previously underappreciated divergence in DFE width among antibiotics is largely caused by their distinct drug-specific dose-response characteristics. Unlike the DFE, the magnitude of the changes in tolerated drug concentration resulting from genome-wide mutations is similar for most drugs but exceptionally small for the antibiotic nitrofurantoin, i.e., mutations generally have considerably smaller resistance effects for nitrofurantoin than for other drugs. A population genetics model predicts that resistance evolution for drugs with this property is severely limited and confined to reproducible mutational paths. We tested this prediction in laboratory evolution experiments using the ""morbidostat"", a device for evolving bacteria in well-controlled drug environments. Nitrofurantoin resistance indeed evolved extremely slowly via reproducible mutations-an almost paradoxical behavior since this drug causes DNA damage and increases the mutation rate. Overall, we identified novel quantitative characteristics of the evolutionary landscape that provide the conceptual foundation for predicting the dynamics of drug resistance evolution.","[Chevereau, Guillaume; Dravecka, Marta; Bollenbach, Tobias] IST Austria, Klosterneuburg, Austria; [Batur, Tugce; Guvenek, Aysegul; Ayhan, Dilay Hazal; Toprak, Erdal] Sabanci Univ, Fac Engn & Nat Sci, Istanbul, Turkey","Chevereau, G (reprint author), INSA Strasbourg, F-67084 Strasbourg, France.",tb@ist.ac.at,,"Ayhan, Dilay Hazal/0000-0002-0497-3294; Lukacisinova, Marta/0000-0002-2519-8004; Bollenbach, Tobias/0000-0003-4398-476X; Balaban, Nathalie/0000-0001-8018-0766",HFSP [RGP0042/2013]; Austrian Science Fund (FWF) [P 27201-B22]; Marie Curie Career Integration [303507],"This work was supported in part by HFSP program grant No. RGP0042/2013 (http://www.hfsp.org/), Austrian Science Fund (FWF) grant No. P 27201-B22 (https://www.fwf.ac.at/), and Marie Curie Career Integration Grant No. 303507 (http://ec.europa.eu/research/mariecurieactions/).

Here we address the role of the latter during axis extension, using Drosophila germband extension (GBE) as a model. We found previously that cells elongate in the anteroposterior (AP) axis in the extending germband, suggesting that an extrinsic tensile force contributed to body axis extension. Here we further characterized the AP cell elongation patterns during GBE, by tracking cells and quantifying their apical cell deformation over time. AP cell elongation forms a gradient culminating at the posterior of the embryo, consistent with an AP-oriented tensile force propagating from there. To identify the morphogenetic movements that could be the source of this extrinsic force, we mapped gastrulation movements temporally using light sheet microscopy to image whole Drosophila embryos. We found that both mesoderm and endoderm invaginations are synchronous with the onset of GBE. The AP cell elongation gradient remains when mesoderm invagination is blocked but is abolished in the absence of endoderm invagination. This suggested that endoderm invagination is the source of the tensile force. We next looked for evidence of this force in a simplified system without polarized cell intercalation, in acellular embryos. Using Particle Image Velocimetry, we identify posteriorwards Myosin II flows towards the presumptive posterior endoderm, which still undergoes apical constriction in acellular embryos as in wildtype. We probed this posterior region using laser ablation and showed that tension is increased in the AP orientation, compared to dorsoventral orientation or to either orientations more anteriorly in the embryo. We propose that apical constriction leading to endoderm invagination is the source of the extrinsic force contributing to germband extension. This highlights the importance of physical interactions between tissues during morphogenesis.","[Lye, Claire M.; Blanchard, Guy B.; Naylor, Huw W.; Adams, Richard J.; Sanson, Benedicte] Univ Cambridge, Dept Physiol Dev & Neurosci, Cambridge, England; [Muresan, Leila] Univ Cambridge, Cambridge Adv Imaging Ctr, Cambridge, England; [Huisken, Jan] Max Planck Inst Mol Cell Biol & Genet, Dresden, Germany","Lye, CM (reprint author), Univ Cambridge, Dept Physiol Dev & Neurosci, Cambridge, England.",bs251@cam.ac.uk,"Huisken, Jan/P-7211-2019","Huisken, Jan/0000-0001-7250-3756; Sanson, Benedicte/0000-0002-2782-4195; Blanchard, Guy/0000-0002-3689-0522; Muresan, Leila/0000-0002-7602-0249",Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council [BB/J010278/1]; Wellcome Trust [099234/Z/12/Z]; Herchel Smith Postdoctoral Fellowship from the University of Cambridge,"This work was funded by a Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council grant BB/J010278/1 to GBB, RJA and BS, a Wellcome Trust Investigator Award 099234/Z/12/Z to BS and a Herchel Smith Postdoctoral Fellowship from the University of Cambridge to CML.

Using a novel clock-perturbing peptide, we established a pivotal role for casein kinase (CK)-2-mediated circadian BMAL1-Ser90 phosphorylation (BMAL1-P) in regulating central and peripheral core clocks. Subsequent analysis of the underlying mechanism showed a novel role of CRY as a repressor for protein kinase. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments and real-time monitoring of protein-protein interactions revealed that CRY-mediated periodic binding of CK23 to BMAL1 inhibits BMAL1 -Ser90 phosphorylation by CK2a. The FAD binding domain of CRY1, two C-terminal BMAL1 domains, and particularly BMAL1-Lys537 acetylation/deacetylation by CLOCK/SIRT1, were shown to be critical for CRY-mediated BMAL1-CK23 binding. Reciprocally, BMAL1-Ser90 phosphorylation is prerequisite for BMAL1-Lys537 acetylation. We propose a dual negative-feedback model in which a CRY-dependent CK2-driven posttranslational BMAL1-P-BMAL1 loop is an integral part of the core clock oscillator.","[Tamaru, Teruya; Takamatsu, Ken] Toho Univ, Sch Med, Dept Physiol & Adv Res, Ctr Med Sci, Tokyo, Japan; [Hattori, Mitsuru; Honda, Kousuke; Ozawa, Takeaki] Univ Tokyo, Dept Chem, Tokyo 113, Japan; [Nakahata, Yasukazu] Nara Inst Sci & Technol, Grad Sch Biol Sci, Lab Gene Regulat Res, Ikoma, Japan; [Sassone-Corsi, Paolo] Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Biol Chem, Irvine, CA 92717 USA; [van der Horst, Gijsbertus T.

Loss-of-function of synaptotagmin-1 or -7 selectively impairs the fast and slow phase of release, respectively, but does not change the size of the readily-releasable pool (RRP) of vesicles as measured by stimulation of release with hypertonic sucrose, or alter the rate of vesicle priming into the RRP. Here we show, however, that simultaneous loss-of-function of both synaptotagmin-1 and -7 dramatically decreased the capacity of the RRP, again without altering the rate of vesicle priming into the RRP. Either synaptotagmin-1 or -7 was sufficient to rescue the RRP size in neurons lacking both synaptotagmin-1 and -7. Although maintenance of RRP size was Ca2+-independent, mutations in Ca2+-binding sequences of synaptotagmin-1 or synaptotagmin-7-which are contained in flexible top-loop sequences of their C2 domains-blocked the ability of these synaptotagmins to maintain the RRP size. Both synaptotagmins bound to SNARE complexes; SNARE complex binding was reduced by the top-loop mutations that impaired RRP maintenance. Thus, synaptotagmin-1 and -7 perform redundant functions in maintaining the capacity of the RRP in addition to nonredundant functions in the Ca2+ triggering of different phases of release.","[Bacaj, Taulant; Wu, Dick; Burre, Jacqueline; Suedhof, Thomas C.] Stanford Univ, Dept Mol & Cellular Physiol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Bacaj, Taulant; Wu, Dick; Burre, Jacqueline; Suedhof, Thomas C.] Stanford Univ, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Wu, Dick; Malenka, Robert C.] Stanford Univ, Dept Psychiat & Behav Sci, Nancy Pritzker Lab, Sch Med, Stanford, CA USA; [Liu, Xinran] Yale Univ, Sch Med, Dept Cell Biol, New Haven, CT 06510 USA","Bacaj, T (reprint author), Stanford Univ, Dept Mol & Cellular Physiol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",tcs1@stanford.edu,,,"National Institutes of Health (NIH) of the USA [MH100752, NS08708601, NS077906, MH086403]","The study received funding from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) of the USA (MH100752 to DW; NS08708601 to TB; NS077906 to TCS; MH086403 to RCM).

Both hyperinflammation and immunosuppression are implicated as causes of morbidity and mortality. Dendritic cell (DC) loss has been observed in septic patients and in experimental sepsis models, but the role of DCs in sepsis, and the mechanisms and significance of DC loss, are poorly understood. Here, we report that mice with selective deletion of the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) in DCs (GR(CD11c-cre)) were highly susceptible to LPS-induced septic shock, evidenced by elevated inflammatory cytokine production, hypothermia, and mortality. Neutralizing anti-IL-12 antibodies prevented hypothermia and death, demonstrating that endogenous GC-mediated suppression of IL-12 is protective. In LPS-challenged GR(CD11c-cre) mice, CD8(+) DCs were identified as the major source of prolonged IL-12 production, which correlated with elevations of NK cell-derived IFN-gamma. In addition, the loss of GR in CD11c(+) cells rescued LPS-induced loss of CD8(+) DCs but not other DC subsets. Unlike wildtype animals, exposure of GR(CD11c-cre) mice to low-dose LPS did not induce CD8(+) DC loss or tolerance to subsequent challenge with high dose, but neutralization of IL-12 restored the ability of low-dose LPS to tolerize. Therefore, endogenous glucocorticoids blunt LPS-induced inflammation and promote tolerance by suppressing DC IL-12 production.","[Li, Caiyi C.; Munitic, Ivana; Mittelstadt, Paul R.; Castro, Ehydel; Ashwell, Jonathan D.] NCI, Lab Immune Cell Biol, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA","Li, CYC (reprint author), NCI, Lab Immune Cell Biol, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA.",jda@pop.nci.nih.gov,"Munitic, Ivana/S-3197-2018","Munitic, Ivana/0000-0002-5171-9950","CCR, NCI intramural research program","This work was funded by the CCR, NCI intramural research program.

How cells integrate these distinct inputs to generate organs of the appropriate size and shape is largely unknown. The transcriptional coactivator Yorkie (Yki, a YES-Associated Protein, or YAP) acts downstream of patterning morphogens and other tissue-intrinsic signals to promote organ growth. Yki activity is regulated primarily by the Warts/Hippo (Wts/Hpo) tumour suppressor pathway, which impedes nuclear access of Yki by a cytoplasmic tethering mechanism. Here, we show that the TOR pathway regulates Yki by a separate and novel mechanism in the Drosophila wing. Instead of controlling Yki nuclear access, TOR signaling governs Yki action after it reaches the nucleus by allowing it to gain access to its target genes. When TOR activity is inhibited, Yki accumulates in the nucleus but is sequestered from its normal growth-promoting target genes-a phenomenon we term ""nuclear seclusion."" Hence, we posit that in addition to its well-known role in stimulating cellular metabolism in response to nutrients, TOR also promotes wing growth by liberating Yki from nuclear seclusion, a parallel pathway that we propose contributes to the scaling of wing size with nutrient availability.","[Parker, Joseph; Struhl, Gary] Columbia Univ, Dept Genet & Dev, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Parker, Joseph] Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Div Biol, London, England","Parker, J (reprint author), Columbia Univ, Dept Genet & Dev, New York, NY 10027 USA.",jp2488@columbia.edu,,,Wellcome Trust Sir Henry Wellcome Postdoctoral Fellowship; Ellison Medical Foundation Senior Scholar Award; Howard Hughes Medical Institute Investigator Award; National Institutes of Health [NIH RO1 GM113000],"This study was supported by a Wellcome Trust Sir Henry Wellcome Postdoctoral Fellowship to JP, an Ellison Medical Foundation Senior Scholar Award, a Howard Hughes Medical Institute Investigator Award and National Institutes of Health grant NIH RO1 GM113000 to GS.

Here we use RNA-seq in combination with high resolution histological analyses to show that aging leads to a significant deterioration of neurovascular structures including basement membrane reduction, pericyte loss, and astrocyte dysfunction. Neurovascular decline was sufficient to cause vascular leakage and correlated strongly with an increase in neuroinflammation including up-regulation of complement component C1QA in microglia/monocytes. Importantly, long-term aerobic exercise from midlife to old age prevented this age-related neurovascular decline, reduced C1QA+ microglia/monocytes, and increased synaptic plasticity and overall behavioral capabilities of aged mice. Concomitant with age-related neurovascular decline and complement activation, astrocytic Apoe dramatically decreased in aged mice, a decrease that was prevented by exercise. Given the role of APOE in maintaining the neurovascular unit and as an anti-inflammatory molecule, this suggests a possible link between astrocytic Apoe, age-related neurovascular dysfunction and microglia/monocyte activation. To test this, Apoe-deficient mice were exercised from midlife to old age and in contrast to wild-type (Apoe-sufficient) mice, exercise had little to no effect on age-related neurovascular decline or microglia/monocyte activation in the absence of APOE. Collectively, our data shows that neurovascular structures decline with age, a process that we propose to be intimately linked to complement activation in microglia/monocytes. Exercise prevents these changes, but not in the absence of APOE, opening up new avenues for understanding the complex interactions between neurovascular and neuroinflammatory responses in aging and neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease.","[Soto, Ileana; Graham, Leah C.; Richter, Hannah J.; Simeone, Stephen N.; Radell, Jake E.; Grabowska, Weronika; Funkhouser, W.

Neuroscience data, in contrast, are still rarely shared, greatly limiting the potential for secondary discovery and the acceleration of research progress. Although the attitude toward data sharing is non-uniform across neuroscience sub-domains, widespread adoption of data sharing practice will require a cultural shift in the community. Digital reconstructions of axonal and dendritic morphology constitute a particularly ""sharable"" kind of data. The popularity of the public repository NeuroMorpho. Org demonstrates that data sharing can benefit both users and contributors. Increased data availability is also catalyzing the grassroots development and spontaneous integration of complementary resources, research tools, and community initiatives. Even in this rare successful subfield, however, more data are still unshared than shared. Our experience as developers and curators of NeuroMorpho. Org suggests that greater transparency regarding the expectations and consequences of sharing (or not sharing) data, combined with public disclosure of which datasets are shared and which are not, may expedite the transition to community-wide data sharing.","George Mason Univ, Krasnow Inst Adv Study, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA","Ascoli, GA (reprint author), George Mason Univ, Krasnow Inst Adv Study, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA.",ascoli@gmu.edu,,,"NINDS NIH HHS [R01 NS86082, R01 NS039600, R01 NS086082, R01 NS39600]",,,58,10,10,0,15,PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE,SAN FRANCISCO,"1160 BATTERY STREET, STE 100, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94111 USA",1545-7885,,,PLOS BIOL,PLoS.

Warming temperatures have induced changes in species physiology, phenology, and have decreased body size. Such modifications can impact population dynamics and could lead to changes in life cycle and demography. More specifically, conceptual frameworks predict that global warming will severely threaten tropical ectotherms while temperate ectotherms should resist or even benefit from higher temperatures. However, experimental studies measuring the impacts of future warming trends on temperate ectotherms' life cycle and population persistence are lacking. Here we investigate the impacts of future climates on a model vertebrate ectotherm species using a large-scale warming experiment. We manipulated climatic conditions in 18 seminatural populations over two years to obtain a present climate treatment and a warm climate treatment matching IPCC predictions for future climate. Warmer temperatures caused a faster body growth, an earlier reproductive onset, and an increased voltinism, leading to a highly accelerated life cycle but also to a decrease in adult survival. A matrix population model predicts that warm climate populations in our experiment should go extinct in around 20 y. Comparing our experimental climatic conditions to conditions encountered by populations across Europe, we suggest that warming climates should threaten a significant number of populations at the southern range of the distribution. Our findings stress the importance of experimental approaches on the entire life cycle to more accurately predict population and species persistence in future climates.","[Bestion, Elvire; Richard, Murielle; Clobert, Jean] CNRS, USR 2936, Stn Ecol Expt Moulis, Moulis, France; [Bestion, Elvire; Teyssier, Aimeric; Cote, Julien] Univ Toulouse 3, CNRS, ENFA, F-31062 Toulouse, France; [Bestion, Elvire; Teyssier, Aimeric; Cote, Julien] Lab Evolut & Divers Biol, EDB UMR5174, Toulouse, France; [Bestion, Elvire] Univ Exeter, Coll Life & Environm Sci, Environm & Sustainabil Inst, Penryn, Cornwall, England; [Teyssier, Aimeric] Univ Ghent, Terr Ecol Unit, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium","Bestion, E (reprint author), CNRS, USR 2936, Stn Ecol Expt Moulis, Moulis, France.",e.bestion@exeter.ac.uk; julien.cote@univ-tlse3.fr,"Cote, Julien/B-7809-2011; Bestion, Elvire/D-4281-2015","Cote, Julien/0000-0002-4453-5969; Bestion, Elvire/0000-0001-5622-7907","French Laboratory of Excellence project ""TULIP"" [ANR-10-LABX-41, ANR-11-IDEX-0002-02];  [ANR-12-JSV7-0004-01]","This work was supported by the French Laboratory of Excellence project ""TULIP"" (ANR-10-LABX-41; ANR-11-IDEX-0002-02) and by an ANR-12-JSV7-0004-01 to JCo.

Here, we demonstrate that glucose activates the unfolded protein response transducer inositol-requiring enzyme 1 alpha (IRE1 alpha) to initiate X-box-binding protein 1 (Xbp1) mRNA splicing in adult primary beta cells. Using mRNA sequencing (mRNA-Seq), we show that unconventional Xbp1 mRNA splicing is required to increase and decrease the expression of several hundred mRNAs encoding functions that expand the protein secretory capacity for increased insulin production and protect from oxidative damage, respectively. At 2 wk after tamoxifen-mediated Ire1 alpha deletion, mice develop hyperglycemia and hypoinsulinemia, due to defective beta cell function that was exacerbated upon feeding and glucose stimulation. Although previous reports suggest IRE1 alpha degrades insulin mRNAs, Ire1 alpha deletion did not alter insulin mRNA expression either in the presence or absence of glucose stimulation. Instead, beta cell failure upon Ire1 alpha deletion was primarily due to reduced proinsulin mRNA translation primarily because of defective glucose-stimulated induction of a dozen genes required for the signal recognition particle (SRP), SRP receptors, the translocon, the signal peptidase complex, and over 100 other genes with many other intracellular functions. In contrast, Ire1 alpha deletion in beta cells increased the expression of over 300 mRNAs encoding functions that cause inflammation and oxidative stress, yet only a few of these accumulated during high glucose. Antioxidant treatment significantly reduced glucose intolerance and markers of inflammation and oxidative stress in mice with beta cell-specific Ire1a deletion. The results demonstrate that glucose activates IRE1 alpha-mediated Xbp1 splicing to expand the secretory capacity of the beta cell for increased proinsulin synthesis and to limit oxidative stress that leads to beta cell failure.","[Hassler, Justin R.; Wang, Shiyu; Han, Jaeseok; Kodali, Vamsi K.; Li, Philip; Nguyen, Julie; Baudouin, Gregory; Itkin-Ansari, Pamela; Volkmann, Niels; Kaufman, Randal J.] Sanford Burnham Prebys Med Discovery Inst, Degenerat Dis Program, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA; [Hassler, Justin R.; Scheuner, Donalyn L.; George, Jenny S.; Davis, Cory; Malhi, Harmeet; Kaufman, Randal J.] Univ Michigan, Dept Biol Chem, Med Ctr, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Scheuner, Donalyn L.] Eli Lilly & Co, Lilly Corp Ctr, Lilly Res Labs, Indianapolis, IN 46285 USA; [Wu, Shengyang P.; Kaufman, Randal J.] Univ Michigan, Dept Internal Med, Med Ctr, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Bai, Yongsheng; Sartor, Maureen; Cavalcoli, James] Univ Michigan, Med Ctr, NCIBI Dept Bioinformat, Ann Arbor, MI USA; [Bai, Yongsheng] Indiana State Univ, Dept Biol, Terre Haute, IN USA; [Zhang, Yaoyang; Yates, John R., III] Scripps Res Inst, Dept Chem Physiol & Cell Biol, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA","Hassler, JR (reprint author), Sanford Burnham Prebys Med Discovery Inst, Degenerat Dis Program, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA.",rkaufman@sbpdiscovery.org,"Sartor, Maureen/L-2902-2019","Zhang, Yaoyang/0000-0001-5363-9834","National Institutes of Health grant [R37DK042394, R01DK088227, R01HL052173, GM098412]; JDRF [201301613]","Sources of funding for this study included: The National Institutes of Health grant: R37DK042394 (RJK), http://www.rdatlas.com/portal/portal.cfm?page=grants&applicationid=7996351.

In this study, we show that serum and glucocorticoid regulated kinase 1 (SGK1) expression is down-regulated in the postmortem PFC of PTSD subjects. Furthermore, we demonstrate that inhibition of SGK1 in the rat medial PFC results in helplessness-and anhedonic-like behaviors in rodent models. These behavioral changes are accompanied by abnormal dendritic spine morphology and synaptic dysfunction. Together, the results are consistent with the possibility that altered SGK1 signaling contributes to the behavioral and morphological phenotypes associated with traumatic stress pathophysiology.","[Licznerski, Pawel; Duric, Vanja; Banasr, Mounira; Ota, Kristie T.; Kang, Hyo Jung; Krystal, John H.; Duman, Ronald S.] Yale Univ, Sch Med, Dept Psychiat, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; [Licznerski, Pawel; Alavian, Kambiz N.; Jonas, Elizabeth A.] Yale Univ, Sch Med, Dept Internal Med, Endocrinol Sect, New Haven, CT 06510 USA; [Duric, Vanja] Des Moines Univ, Dept Physiol & Pharmacol, Des Moines, IA USA; [Alavian, Kambiz N.] Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Dept Med, Div Brain Sci, London, England; [Ursano, Robert] Uniformed Serv Univ Hlth Sci, Dept Psychiat, Bethesda, MD 20814 USA; [Ursano, Robert] Uniformed Serv Univ Hlth Sci, Ctr Study Traumat Stress, Bethesda, MD 20814 USA; [Ursano, Robert] Traumat Stress Brain Study Grp, Bethesda, MD USA; [Krystal, John H.; Duman, Ronald S.] Connecticut Mental Hlth Ctr, Abraham Ribicoff Res Facil, New Haven, CT 06519 USA; [Krystal, John H.; Duman, Ronald S.] VA Connecticut Healthcare Syst, VA Natl Ctr PTSD, West Haven, CT USA; [Krystal, John H.] Yale New Haven Med Ctr, New Haven, CT 06504 USA","Licznerski, P (reprint author), Yale Univ, Sch Med, Dept Psychiat, New Haven, CT 06520 USA.",ronald.duman@yale.edu,"Alavian, Kambiz/O-2831-2017; Alavian, Kambiz N/D-7720-2012","Alavian, Kambiz/0000-0002-0653-3057; Ursano, Robert/0000-0002-1861-9173","VA PTSD Center grant; State of Connecticut, Department of Mental Health and Addiction Services; National Institutes of Health (NIH) Ruth L.

We first collected diffusion imaging data using magnetic resonance imaging to identify the medial branch of the superior longitudinal fasciculus (SLF), a white-matter tract connecting frontal control areas to parietal regions. We then quantified the modulations in oscillatory activity using magnetoencephalography in the same subjects performing a spatial attention task. We found that subjects with a stronger SLF volume in the right compared to the left hemisphere (or vice versa) also were the subjects who had a better ability to modulate right compared to left hemisphere alpha and gamma band synchronization, with the latter also predicting biases in reaction time.

Using proteomics on mouse cortex in vivo, we pulled down proteins interacting with CB1 in neurons and show that the CB1 receptor assembles with multiple members of the WAVE1 complex and the RhoGTPase Rac1 and modulates their activity. Activation levels of CB1 receptor directly impacted on actin polymerization and stability via WAVE1 in growth cones of developing neurons, leading to their collapse, as well as in synaptic spines of mature neurons, leading to their retraction. In adult mice, CB1 receptor agonists attenuated activity-dependent remodeling of dendritic spines in spinal cord neurons in vivo and suppressed inflammatory pain by regulating the WAVE1 complex. This study reports novel signaling mechanisms for cannabinoidergic modulation of the nervous system and demonstrates a previously unreported role for the WAVE1 complex in therapeutic applications of cannabinoids.","[Njoo, Christian; Agarwal, Nitin; Kuner, Rohini] Heidelberg Univ, Inst Pharmacol, Med Fac Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany; [Lutz, Beat] Johannes Gutenberg Univ Mainz, Univ Med Ctr, Inst Physiol Chem, D-55122 Mainz, Germany","Njoo, C (reprint author), Heidelberg Univ, Inst Pharmacol, Med Fac Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.",rohini.kuner@pharma.uni-heidelberg.de,,,European Research Council (ERC) [294293]; collaborative research center 1158 of the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft [SFB 1158],"This work was supported by grants to RK from the European Research Council (ERC) Advanced Investigator project number 294293 and the collaborative research center 1158 (SFB 1158) of the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft.

Although redox gradients have been proposed to entrain the dorsal-ventral axis by acting upstream of nodal, manipulating the activity of redox gradients only has modest consequences, suggesting that other factors are responsible for orienting nodal expression and defining the dorsal-ventral axis. Here we uncover the function of Panda, a maternally provided transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) ligand that requires the activin receptor-like kinases (Alk) Alk3/6 and Alk1/2 receptors to break the radial symmetry of the embryo and orient the dorsal-ventral axis by restricting nodal expression. We found that the double inhibition of the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) type I receptors Alk3/6 and Alk1/2 causes a phenotype dramatically more severe than the BMP2/4 loss-of-function phenotype, leading to extreme ventralization of the embryo through massive ectopic expression of nodal, suggesting that an unidentified signal acting through BMP type I receptors cooperates with BMP2/4 to restrict nodal expression. We identified this ligand as the product of maternal Panda mRNA. Double inactivation of panda and bmp2/4 led to extreme ventralization, mimicking the phenotype caused by inactivation of the two BMP receptors. Inhibition of maternal panda mRNA translation disrupted the early spatial restriction of nodal, leading to persistent massive ectopic expression of nodal on the dorsal side despite the presence of Lefty. Phylogenetic analysis indicates that Panda is not a prototypical BMP ligand but a member of a subfamily of TGF-beta distantly related to Inhibins, Lefty, and TGF-beta that includes Maverick from Drosophila and GDF15 from vertebrates. Indeed, overexpression of Panda does not appear to directly or strongly activate phosphoSmad1/5/8 signaling, suggesting that although this TGF-beta may require Alk1/2 and/or Alk3/6 to antagonize nodal expression, it may do so by sequestering a factor essential for Nodal signaling, by activating a non-Smad pathway downstream of the type I receptors, or by activating extremely low levels of pSmad1/5/8. We provide evidence that, although panda mRNA is broadly distributed in the early embryo, local expression of panda mRNA efficiently orients the dorsal-ventral axis and that Panda activity is required locally in the early embryo to specify this axis. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that maternal panda mRNA is both necessary and sufficient to orient the dorsal-ventral axis. These results therefore provide evidence that in the highly regulative sea urchin embryo, the activity of spatially restricted maternal factors regulates patterning along the dorsal-ventral axis.","[Haillot, Emmanuel; Molina, Maria Dolores; Lapraz, Francois; Lepage, Thierry] Univ Nice Sophia Antipolis, Inst Biol Valrose, INSERM, U1091,UMR 7277,CNRS, F-06189 Nice, France","Lepage, T (reprint author), Univ Nice Sophia Antipolis, Inst Biol Valrose, INSERM, U1091,UMR 7277,CNRS, F-06189 Nice, France.",tlepage@unice.fr,"Lapraz, Francois/W-4948-2017","Lapraz, Francois/0000-0001-9209-2018; Haillot, Emmanuel/0000-0001-5210-6112","Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR) [ANR-14-CE11-0006-01]; Association pour la Recherche sur le Cancer (ARC) grant [7801, SFI20121205586]; Ministere de la Recherche et de l'enseignement superieur; European Molecular Biology Organization (EMBO) [1234-2011]; ARC postdoctoral fellowship [2011-1204261]","This work was supported by the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS), a grant from the Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR) grant to TL (ANR-14-CE11-0006-01) and by support from the Association pour la Recherche sur le Cancer (ARC) (grant 7801 and SFI20121205586) to TL.

However, in some species, mating preferences seem largely individual-specific, suggesting that they might target genetic or behavioral compatibility. Few studies have quantified the fitness consequences of allowing versus preventing such idiosyncratic mate choice. Here, we report on an experiment that controls for variation in overall partner quality and show that zebra finch (Taeniopygia guttata) pairs that resulted from free mate choice achieved a 37% higher reproductive success than pairs that were forced to mate. Cross-fostering of freshly laid eggs showed that embryo mortality (before hatching) primarily depended on the identity of the genetic parents, whereas offspring mortality during the rearing period depended on foster-parent identity. Therefore, preventing mate choice should lead to an increase in embryo mortality if mate choice targets genetic compatibility (for embryo viability), and to an increase in offspring mortality if mate choice targets behavioral compatibility (for better rearing). We found that pairs from both treatments showed equal rates of embryo mortality, but chosen pairs were better at raising offspring. These results thus support the behavioral, but not the genetic, compatibility hypothesis. Further exploratory analyses reveal several differences in behavior and fitness components between ""free-choice"" and ""forced"" pairs.","[Ihle, Malika; Kempenaers, Bart; Forstmeier, Wolfgang] Max Planck Inst Ornithol, Dept Behav Ecol & Evolutionary Genet, Seewiesen, Germany","Ihle, M (reprint author), Max Planck Inst Ornithol, Dept Behav Ecol & Evolutionary Genet, Seewiesen, Germany.",mihle@orn.mpg.de,"Ihle, Malika/H-6876-2019","Ihle, Malika/0000-0002-3242-5981; Kempenaers, Bart/0000-0002-7505-5458",,,,97,45,46,1,72,PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE,SAN FRANCISCO,"1160 BATTERY STREET, STE 100, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94111 USA",1544-9173,1545-7885,,PLOS BIOL,PLoS.

However, it is not known whether network formation and stability is constrained by the sign of synaptic connections between neurons within the network. Here we show that switching the sign of a synapse within a neural circuit can reverse the behavioral output. The inhibitory tyramine-gated chloride channel, LGC-55, induces head relaxation and inhibits forward locomotion during the Caenorhabditis elegans escape response. We switched the ion selectivity of an inhibitory LGC-55 anion channel to an excitatory LGC-55 cation channel. The engineered cation channel is properly trafficked in the native neural circuit and results in behavioral responses that are opposite to those produced by activation of the LGC-55 anion channel. Our findings indicate that switches in ion selectivity of ligand-gated ion channels (LGICs) do not affect network connectivity or stability and may provide an evolutionary and a synthetic mechanism to change behavior.","[Pirri, Jennifer K.; Rayes, Diego; Alkema, Mark J.] Univ Massachusetts, Dept Neurobiol, Sch Med, Worcester, MA 01655 USA; [Rayes, Diego] UNS CONICET, Inst Invest Bioquim Bahia Blanca, Bahia Blanca, Buenos Aires, Argentina","Pirri, JK (reprint author), Univ Massachusetts, Dept Neurobiol, Sch Med, Worcester, MA 01655 USA.",mark.alkema@umassmed.edu,,,Argentinian National Scientific and Technical Research Council (CONICET); National Institutes of Health [GM084491],"This work was supported by a fellowship of the Argentinian National Scientific and Technical Research Council (CONICET) to DR and a grant GM084491 of the National Institutes of Health to MJA.

To investigate the neurophysiological basis for offline gains, we performed single-unit recordings in motor cortex as rats learned a skilled upper-limb task. We found that sleep improved movement speed with preservation of accuracy. These offline improvements were linked to both replay of task-related ensembles during non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep and temporal shifts that more tightly bound motor cortical ensembles to movements; such offline gains and temporal shifts were not evident with sleep restriction. Interestingly, replay was linked to the coincidence of slow-wave events and bursts of spindle activity. Neurons that experienced the most consistent replay also underwent the most significant temporal shift and binding to the motor task. Significantly, replay and the associated performance gains after sleep only occurred when animals first learned the skill; continued practice during later stages of learning (i.e., after motor kinematics had stabilized) did not show evidence of replay. Our results highlight how replay of synchronous neural activity during sleep mediates large-scale neural plasticity and stabilizes kinematics during early motor learning.","[Ramanathan, Dhakshin S.; Gulati, Tanuj; Ganguly, Karunesh] San Francisco VA Med Ctr, Neurol & Rehabil Serv, San Francisco, CA 94121 USA; [Ramanathan, Dhakshin S.] San Francisco VA Med Ctr, Psychiat Serv, San Francisco, CA USA; [Ramanathan, Dhakshin S.] Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Psychiat, San Francisco, CA USA; [Gulati, Tanuj; Ganguly, Karunesh] Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Neurol, San Francisco, CA USA","Ganguly, K (reprint author), San Francisco VA Med Ctr, Neurol & Rehabil Serv, San Francisco, CA 94121 USA.",karunesh.ganguly@ucsf.edu,,,"Department of Veterans Affairs, Veterans Health Administration [CDA B6674W]; American Heart Association; Northern California Institute for Research and Education (NCIRE); start-up funds from UCSF Department of Neurology; Burroughs Wellcome Fund","This work was supported by fellowship awards from the Department of Veterans Affairs, Veterans Health Administration (http://www.va.gov/) to DSR and from the American Heart Association (http://www.heart.org/HEARTORG/) to TG.

PGK1 plays a key role in coordinating glycolytic energy production with one-carbon metabolism, serine biosynthesis, and cellular redox regulation. Here, we report that PGK1 is acetylated at lysine 220 (K220), which inhibits PGK1 activity by disrupting the binding with its substrate, ADP. We have identified KAT9 and HDAC3 as the potential acetyltransferase and deacetylase, respectively, for PGK1. Insulin promotes K220 deacetylation to stimulate PGK1 activity. We show that the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway regulates HDAC3 S424 phosphorylation, which promotes HDAC3-PGK1 interaction and PGK1 K220 deacetylation.

Yet, the neural mechanisms that may allow such dynamic routing of the information flow are not yet fully understood. We investigated the role of gamma band (50-80 Hz) oscillations in transient modulations of communication among neural populations by using measures of direction-specific causal information transfer. We found that the local phase of gamma-band rhythmic activity exerted a stimulus-modulated and spatially-asymmetric directed effect on the firing rate of spatially separated populations within the primary visual cortex. The relationships between gamma phases at different sites (phase shifts) could be described as a stimulus-modulated gamma-band wave propagating along the spatial directions with the largest information transfer. We observed transient stimulus-related changes in the spatial configuration of phases (compatible with changes in direction of gamma wave propagation) accompanied by a relative increase of the amount of information flowing along the instantaneous direction of the gamma wave. These effects were specific to the gamma-band and suggest that the time-varying relationships between gamma phases at different locations mark, and possibly causally mediate, the dynamic reconfiguration of functional connections.","[Besserve, Michel; Logothetis, Nikos K.] Max Planck Inst Biol Cybernet, D-72076 Tubingen, Germany; [Besserve, Michel; Scholkopf, Bernhard] Max Planck Inst Intelligent Syst, Tubingen, Germany; [Lowe, Scott C.] Univ Edinburgh, Sch Informat, Inst Adapt & Neural Computat, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland; [Logothetis, Nikos K.] Univ Manchester, Div Imaging Sci & Biomed Engn, Manchester, Lancs, England; [Panzeri, Stefano] Ist Italiano Tecnol, Ctr Neurosci & Cognit Syst UniTn, Lab Neural Computat, Rovereto, Italy","Besserve, M (reprint author), Max Planck Inst Biol Cybernet, Spemannstr 38, D-72076 Tubingen, Germany.",michel.besserve@tuebingen.mpg.de,"Scholkopf, Bernhard/A-7570-2013; Logothetis, Nikos/U-9282-2019; Panzeri, Stefano/L-5977-2013","Scholkopf, Bernhard/0000-0002-8177-0925; Panzeri, Stefano/0000-0003-1700-8909","Max Planck Society; SI-CODE project of EU-FP7 Future and Emerging Technologies (FET) program [FP7-284553]; Marie Curie program [PITN-GA-2011-290011]; Autonomous Province of Trento, Call ""Grandi Progetti,"" project ""Characterizing and improving brain mechanisms of attention - ATTEND; University of Edinburgh School of Informatics Doctoral Training Centre in Neuroinformatics and Computational Neuroscience from UK EPSRC [EP/F500385/1, BB/F529254/1]; University of Edinburgh School of Informatics Doctoral Training Centre in Neuroinformatics and Computational Neuroscience from BBSRC; University of Edinburgh School of Informatics Doctoral Training Centre in Neuroinformatics and Computational Neuroscience from MRC research councils","We acknowledge funding from the Max Planck Society.

Little is known about the neural substrate of visual motion in infants, although behavioural studies suggest that motion perception is rudimentary at birth and matures steadily over the first few years. Here, by measuring Blood Oxygenated Level Dependent (BOLD) responses to flow versus random-motion stimuli, we demonstrate that the major cortical areas serving motion processing in adults are operative by 7 wk of age. Resting-state correlations demonstrate adult-like functional connectivity between the motion-selective associative areas, but not between primary cortex and temporo-occipital and posterior-insular cortices. Taken together, the results suggest that the development of motion perception may be limited by slow maturation of the subcortical input and of the cortico-cortical connections. In addition they support the existence of independent input to primary (V1) and temporo-occipital (V5/MT+) cortices very early in life.","[Biagi, Laura; Tosetti, Michela; Morrone, Maria Concetta] IRCCS Stella Maris Fdn, Pisa, Italy; [Crespi, Sofia Allegra] Univ Vita Salute San Raffaele, Dept Psychol, Milan, Italy; [Crespi, Sofia Allegra] Hosp San Raffaele, CERMAC, I-20132 Milan, Italy; [Crespi, Sofia Allegra] Hosp San Raffaele, Neuroradiol Unit, I-20132 Milan, Italy; [Morrone, Maria Concetta] Univ Pisa, Dept Translat Res New Technol Med & Surg, Pisa, Italy","Morrone, MC (reprint author), IRCCS Stella Maris Fdn, Pisa, Italy.",concetta@in.cnr.it,"Tosetti, Michela/K-5749-2016; Biagi, Laura/K-5692-2016; Morrone, Maria Concetta/C-6756-2014","Tosetti, Michela/0000-0002-2515-7560; Biagi, Laura/0000-0003-2159-439X; Morrone, Maria Concetta/0000-0002-1025-0316; CRESPI, Sofia Allegra/0000-0001-7429-0440",European Research Council [ECSPLAIN 338866]; Italian Futuro in Ricerca [RBFR1332DJ],"This work was supported by European Research Council http://erc.europa.eu/ Grant ECSPLAIN 338866 to MCM and Italian Futuro in Ricerca http://futuroinricerca.miur.it/ grant RBFR1332DJ to SAC.

Here, we elucidate a novel critical maintenance mechanism for Schwann cell (SC)-axon interaction. Using mouse genetics, ablation of the transcriptional regulators histone deacetylases 1 and 2 (HDAC1/2) in adult SCs severely affected paranodal and nodal integrity and led to demyelination/remyelination. Expression levels of the HDAC1/2 target gene myelin protein zero (P0) were reduced by half, accompanied by altered localization and stability of neurofascin (NFasc) 155, NFasc186, and loss of Caspr and septate-like junctions. We identify P0 as a novel binding partner of NFasc155 and NFasc186, both in vivo and by in vitro adhesion assay. Furthermore, we demonstrate that HDAC1/2-dependent P0 expression is crucial for the maintenance of paranodal/nodal integrity and axonal function through interaction of P0 with neurofascins. In addition, we show that the latter mechanism is impaired by some P0 mutations that lead to late onset Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease.","[Bruegger, Valerie; Engler, Stefanie; Ruff, Sophie; Muenger, Emmanuelle; Vaquie, Adrien; Egger, Boris; Jacob, Claire] Univ Fribourg, Dept Biol, CH-1700 Fribourg, Switzerland; [Engler, Stefanie; Pereira, Jorge A.; Horn, Michael; Sidiropoulos, Paris N.

Although these rates have been characterized in vitro and in cell culture models, they have seldom been determined in vivo for human viruses. Here, we use the intrapatient frequency of premature stop codons to quantify the HIV-1 genome-wide rate of spontaneous mutation in DNA sequences from peripheral blood mononuclear cells. This reveals an extremely high mutation rate of (4.1 +/- 1.7) x 10(-3) per base per cell, the highest reported for any biological entity. Sequencing of plasma-derived sequences yielded a mutation frequency 44 times lower, indicating that a large fraction of viral genomes are lethally mutated and fail to reach plasma. We show that the HIV-1 reverse transcriptase contributes only 2% of mutations, whereas 98% result from editing by host cytidine deaminases of the A3 family. Hypermutated viral sequences are less abundant in patients showing rapid disease progression compared to normal progressors, highlighting the antiviral role of A3 proteins. However, the amount of A3-mediated editing varies broadly, and we find that low-edited sequences are more abundant among rapid progressors, suggesting that suboptimal A3 activity might enhance HIV-1 genetic diversity and pathogenesis.","[Cuevas, Jose M.; Geller, Ron; Garijo, Raquel; Sanjuan, Rafael] Inst Cavanilles Biodiversidad & Biol Evolutiva, Valencia, Spain; [Lopez-Aldeguer, Jose] Hosp Univ La Fe, Valencia, Spain; [Lopez-Aldeguer, Jose] Spanish AIDS Res Network, CoRIS, Madrid, Spain; [Lopez-Aldeguer, Jose] Spanish AIDS Res Network, HIV Biobank, Madrid, Spain; [Sanjuan, Rafael] Univ Valencia, Dept Genet, Valencia, Spain","Cuevas, JM (reprint author), Inst Cavanilles Biodiversidad & Biol Evolutiva, Valencia, Spain.",rafael.sanjuan@uv.es,"Cuevas, Jose/C-6271-2016; Sanjuan, Rafael/A-4248-2015; Geller, Ron/D-2919-2017","Cuevas, Jose/0000-0003-2049-3554; Geller, Ron/0000-0002-7612-4611","Instituto de Salud Carlos III [RD12/0017 -RIS]; European Research Council [ERC-2011-StG- 281191-VIRMUT]; Spanish Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad [BFU2013-41329-P]; Instituto de Salud Carlos III; Spanish Health Ministry [RD06/0006/0035, RD12/0017/0037]; ISCIII- Subdireccion General de Evaluacion y el Fondo Europeo de Desarrollo Regional (FEDER); Fundacion para la investigacion y prevencion del SIDA en Espana (FIPSE); Instituto de Salud Carlos III through Red Tematica de Investigacion Cooperativa en SIDA as part of Plan Nacional R+D+I [RIS C03/173, RD12/0017/0018]; ISCIII-Subdireccion General de Evaluacion y el Fondo Europeo de Desarrollo Regional (FEDER)","This work was funded by the Instituto de Salud Carlos III (RD12/0017 -RIS), a Starting Grant from the European Research Council (erc.europea.eu) (ERC-2011-StG- 281191-VIRMUT), and a grant from the Spanish Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad (www.mineco.gob.es) (BFU2013-41329-P) to RS.

Here, using a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) adaptation paradigm, we show that the inferior parietal lobule (IPL) (corresponding to the supramarginal gyrus) exhibited reduction in neural activity due to adaptation when a visual stimulus of the same duration was repeatedly presented. Adaptation was strongest when stimuli of identical durations were repeated, and it gradually decreased as the difference between the reference and test durations increased. This tuning property generalized across a broad range of durations, indicating the presence of general time-representation mechanisms in the IPL. Furthermore, adaptation was observed irrespective of the subject's attention to time. Repetition of a nontemporal aspect of the stimulus (i.e., shape) did not produce neural adaptation in the IPL.

The regulation of the members of the novel class of WASP Homology 2 (WH2) domain-based actin nucleators, however, thus far has largely remained elusive. Our study reveals signal cascades and mechanisms regulating Cordon-Bleu (Cobl). Cobl plays some, albeit not fully understood, role in early arborization of neurons and nucleates actin by a mechanism that requires a combination of all three of its actin monomer-binding WH2 domains. Our experiments reveal that Cobl is regulated by Ca2+ and multiple, direct associations of the Ca2+ sensor Calmodulin (CaM). Overexpression analyses and rescue experiments of Cobl loss-of-function phenotypes with Cobl mutants in primary neurons and in tissue slices demonstrated the importance of CaM binding for Cobl's functions. Cobl-induced dendritic branch initiation was preceded by Ca2+ signals and coincided with local F-actin and CaM accumulations. CaM inhibitor studies showed that Cobl-mediated branching is strictly dependent on CaM activity. Mechanistic studies revealed that Ca2+/CaM modulates Cobl's actin binding properties and furthermore promotes Cobl's previously identified interactions with the membrane-shaping F-BAR protein syndapin I, which accumulated with Cobl at nascent dendritic protrusion sites. The findings of our study demonstrate a direct regulation of an actin nucleator by Ca2+/CaM and reveal that the Ca2+/CaM-controlled molecular mechanisms we discovered are crucial for Cobl's cellular functions. By unveiling the means of Cobl regulation and the mechanisms, by which Ca2+/CaM signals directly converge on a cellular effector promoting actin filament formation, our work furthermore sheds light on how local Ca2+ signals steer and power branch initiation during early arborization of nerve cells-a key process in neuronal network formation.","[Hou, Wenya; Izadi, Maryam; Nemitz, Sabine; Haag, Natja; Kessels, Michael M.; Qualmann, Britta] Univ Jena, Jena Univ Hosp, Inst Biochem 1, Jena, Germany","Hou, WY (reprint author), Univ Jena, Jena Univ Hosp, Inst Biochem 1, Jena, Germany.",Michael.Kessels@med.uni-jena.de; Britta.Qualmann@med.uni-jena.de,,,"Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft [QU116/7-1, RTG1715]; MMK [KE685/3-2, KE685/4-2]","This work was supported by grants from the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft to BQ (QU116/7-1; RTG1715) and MMK (KE685/3-2; KE685/4-2).

Toxin secretion is central to the biology of many bacterial pathogens and is widely accepted as playing a crucial role in disease pathology. To understand the relationship between toxicity and bacterial virulence in greater depth, we studied two sequenced collections of the major human pathogen Staphylococcus aureus and found an unexpected inverse correlation between bacterial toxicity and disease severity. By applying a functional genomics approach, we identified several novel toxicity-affecting loci responsible for the wide range in toxic phenotypes observed within these collections. To understand the apparent higher propensity of low toxicity isolates to cause bacteraemia, we performed several functional assays, and our findings suggest that within-host fitness differences between high- and low-toxicity isolates in human serum is a contributing factor. As invasive infections, such as bacteraemia, limit the opportunities for onward transmission, highly toxic strains could gain an additional between-host fitness advantage, potentially contributing to the maintenance of toxicity at the population level. Our results clearly demonstrate how evolutionary trade-offs between toxicity, relative fitness, and transmissibility are critical for understanding the multifaceted nature of bacterial virulence.","[Laabei, Maisem; Yokoyama, Maho; Ouadi, Khadija; Feil, Edward; Thorpe, Harry A.; Williams, Barnabas; Perkins, Mark; Massey, Ruth C.] Univ Bath, Dept Biol & Biochem, Bath BA2 7AY, Avon, England; [Uhlemann, Anne-Catrin; Austin, Eloise D.] Columbia Univ, Dept Med, New York, NY USA; [Peacock, Sharon J.] Univ Cambridge, Dept Med, Cambridge CB2 2QQ, England; [Clarke, Stephen R.] Cardiff Univ, Sch Pharm & Pharmaceut Sci, Cardiff CF10 3AX, S Glam, Wales; [Dordel, Janina; Holden, Matthew] Wellcome Trust Sanger Inst, Pathogen Genom, Cambridge, England; [Holden, Matthew] Sch Med Med & Biol Sci, St Andrews, Fife, Scotland; [Votintseva, Antonina A.; Crook, Derrick W.; Young, Bernadette C.; Wilson, Daniel J.] Univ Oxford, John Radcliffe Hosp, Nuffield Dept Med, Oxford OX3 9DU, England; [Bowden, Rory; Wilson, Daniel J.] Wellcome Trust Ctr Human Genet, Oxford, England; [Recker, Mario] Univ Exeter, Ctr Math & Environm, Penryn, England","Massey, RC (reprint author), Univ Bath, Dept Biol & Biochem, Bath BA2 7AY, Avon, England.",r.c.massey@bath.ac.uk,"Holden, Matthew TG/K-6449-2014; Wilson, Daniel J/C-1463-2019","Holden, Matthew TG/0000-0002-4958-2166; Wilson, Daniel J/0000-0002-0940-3311; Laabei, Maisem/0000-0002-8425-3704; Dordel, Janina/0000-0002-0839-2235; Williams, Barnabas/0000-0002-3078-8076; Recker, Mario/0000-0001-9489-1315; Young, Bernadette/0000-0001-6071-6770; Massey, Ruth/0000-0002-8154-4039","MRC Confidence in Concepts award; Royal Society Research Fellowship; Oxford NIHR Biomedical Research Centre; UKCRC Modernising Medical Microbiology Consortium; UKCRC Translational Infection Research Initiative - Medical Research Council; National Institute for Health Research of UK Department of Health [G0800778]; Wellcome Trust [087646/Z/08/Z]; Wellcome Trust Clinical Research Training Fellow [101611/Z/13/Z]; Wellcome Trust and the Royal Society [101237/Z/13/Z]; Wellcome Trust core funding [090532/Z/09/Z]; Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council; Medical Research Council [MC_PC_13058, G0800778]; National Institute for Health Research [NF-SI-0512-10047]","ML is funded on an MRC Confidence in Concepts award.

For rodents, active somatosensation includes scanning the immediate environment with the mystacial vibrissae. In doing so, the vibrissae may touch an object at any angle in the whisk cycle. The representation of touch and vibrissa self-motion may in principle be encoded along separate pathways, or share a single pathway, from the periphery to cortex. Past studies established that the spike rates in neurons along the lemniscal pathway from receptors to cortex, which includes the principal trigeminal and ventral-posterior-medial thalamic nuclei, are substantially modulated by touch. In contrast, spike rates along the paralemniscal pathway, which includes the rostral spinal trigeminal interpolaris, posteromedial thalamic, and ventral zona incerta nuclei, are only weakly modulated by touch. Here we find that neurons along the lemniscal pathway robustly encode rhythmic whisking on a cycle-bycycle basis, while encoding along the paralemniscal pathway is relatively poor. Thus, the representations of both touch and self-motion share one pathway. In fact, some individual neurons carry both signals, so that upstream neurons with a supralinear gain function could, in principle, demodulate these signals to recover the known decoding of touch as a function of vibrissa position in the whisk cycle.","[Moore, Jeffrey D.; Kleinfeld, David] Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Phys, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Lindsay, Nicole Mercer; Kleinfeld, David] Univ Calif San Diego, Neurobiol Sect, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Deschenes, Martin] Univ Laval Robert Giffard, Ctr Rech, Quebec City, PQ, Canada","Moore, JD (reprint author), Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Phys, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA.",martin.deschenes@crulrg.ulaval.ca; dk@physics.ucsd.edu,,,"Canadian Institutes of Health Research [MT-5877]; National Institutes of Health [NS058668, NS090595]; US-Israeli Binational Science Foundation [2003222]","We are grateful to the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (www.cihr-irsc.gc.ca) (grant MT-5877), the National Institutes of Health (www.nih.gov/) (grants NS058668 and NS090595), and the US-Israeli Binational Science Foundation (www.bsf.org.il) (grant 2003222) for support.

How this information is exchanged between face-processing centers and brain areas supporting social cognition remains largely unclear. Here we identify these routes using resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging in macaque monkeys. We find that face areas functionally connect to specific regions within frontal, temporal, and parietal cortices, as well as subcortical structures supporting emotive, mnemonic, and cognitive functions. This establishes the existence of an extended face-recognition system in the macaque. Furthermore, the face patch resting state networks and the default mode network in monkeys show a pattern of overlap akin to that between the social brain and the default mode network in humans: this overlap specifically includes the posterior superior temporal sulcus, medial parietal, and dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, areas supporting high-level social cognition in humans. Together, these results reveal the embedding of face areas into larger brain networks and suggest that the resting state networks of the face patch system offer a new, easily accessible venue into the functional organization of the social brain and into the evolution of possibly uniquely human social skills.","[Schwiedrzik, Caspar M.; Zarco, Wilbert; Freiwald, Winrich A.] Rockefeller Univ, Lab Neural Syst, New York, NY 10021 USA; [Everling, Stefan] Univ Western Ontario, Robarts Res Inst, London, ON, Canada","Schwiedrzik, CM (reprint author), Rockefeller Univ, Lab Neural Syst, 1230 York Ave, New York, NY 10021 USA.",cschwiedrz@rockefeller.edu; wfreiwald@rockefeller.edu,"Everling, Stefan/K-5208-2013","Schwiedrzik, Caspar/0000-0003-0661-8859; Zarco, Wilbert/0000-0002-3599-0476","Human Frontier Science Program Long-Term Fellowship [LT001118/2012-L]; National Institutes of Health [F05MH094113]; Canadian Institutes of Health Research [MOP 125982]; Irma T.

Since all biophysical processes are temperature dependent, this interplay is challenged during temperature fluctuations. How the nervous system remains functional during temperature perturbations remains mostly unknown. We present a hitherto unknown mechanism of how temperature-induced changes in neural networks are compensated by changing their neuromodulatory state: activation of neuromodulatory pathways establishes a dynamic coregulation of synaptic and intrinsic conductances with opposing effects on neuronal activity when temperature changes, hence rescuing neuronal activity. Using the well-studied gastric mill pattern generator of the crab, we show that modest temperature increase can abolish rhythmic activity in isolated neural circuits due to increased leak currents in rhythm-generating neurons. Dynamic clamp-mediated addition of leak currents was sufficient to stop neuronal oscillations at low temperatures, and subtraction of additional leak currents at elevated temperatures was sufficient to rescue the rhythm. Despite the apparent sensitivity of the isolated nervous system to temperature fluctuations, the rhythm could be stabilized by activating extrinsic neuromodulatory inputs from descending projection neurons, a strategy that we indeed found to be implemented in intact animals. In the isolated nervous system, temperature compensation was achieved by stronger extrinsic neuromodulatory input from projection neurons or by augmenting projection neuron influence via bath application of the peptide cotransmitter Cancer borealis tachykinin-related peptide la (CabTRP la). CabTRP la activates the modulator-induced current I-MI (a nonlinear voltage-gated inward current) that effectively acted as a negative leak current and counterbalanced the temperature-induced leak to rescue neuronal oscillations. Computational modelling revealed the ability of IMI to reduce detrimental leak-current influences on neuronal networks over a broad conductance range and indicated that leak and IMI are closely coregulated in the biological system to enable stable motor patterns. In conclusion, these results show that temperature compensation does not need to be implemented within the network itself but can be conditionally provided by extrinsic neuromodulatory input that counterbalances temperature-induced modifications of circuit-intrinsic properties.","[Staedele, Carola; Heigele, Stefanie] Univ Ulm, Inst Neurobiol, D-89069 Ulm, Germany; [Staedele, Carola; Stein, Wolfgang] Illinois State Univ, Sch Biol Sci, Normal, IL 61761 USA","Stein, W (reprint author), Univ Ulm, Inst Neurobiol, D-89069 Ulm, Germany.",wstein@neurobiologie.de,,,Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft [STE 937/9-1]; R.D.

The phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)-phosphatase with tensin homology (PTEN) and tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC)-target of rapamycin (TOR) pathways are frequently activated in human cancer, and this activation is often causative of tumorigenesis. We utilized the Gal4-UAS system in Drosophila imaginal primordia, highly proliferative and growing tissues, to analyze the impact of restricted activation of these pathways on neighboring wild-type cell populations. Activation of these pathways leads to an autonomous induction of tissue overgrowth and to a remarkable nonautonomous reduction in growth and proliferation rates of adjacent cell populations. This nonautonomous response occurs independently of where these pathways are activated, is functional all throughout development, takes place across compartments, and is distinct from cell competition. The observed autonomous and nonautonomous effects on tissue growth rely on the up-regulation of the proteoglycan Dally, a major element involved in modulating the spreading, stability, and activity of the growth promoting Decapentaplegic (Dpp)/transforming growth factor beta(TGF-beta) signaling molecule. Our findings indicate that a reduction in the amount of available growth factors contributes to the outcompetition of wild-type cells by overgrowing cell populations. During normal development, the PI3K/PTEN and TSC/TOR pathways play a major role in sensing nutrient availability and modulating the final size of any developing organ. We present evidence that Dally also contributes to integrating nutrient sensing and organ scaling, the fitting of pattern to size.","[Ferreira, Ana; Milan, Marco] Inst Res Biomed IRB Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain; [Milan, Marco] Inst Catalana Recerca & Estudis Avancats, Barcelona, Spain","Ferreira, A (reprint author), Inst Res Biomed IRB Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.",marco.milan@irbbarcelona.org,"Milan, Marco/H-1450-2015","Milan, Marco/0000-0002-7111-6444; Ferreira, Ana/0000-0002-9388-9958","Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad [BFU2010-21123, BFU2013-44485]; AGAUR [SGR 00118]; Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia [SFRH/BD/68745/2010]; ICREA","This work was funded by the Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad (BFU2010-21123 and BFU2013-44485 grants), AGAUR (2005 SGR 00118 grant), and Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (SFRH/BD/68745/2010 grant).

Because visual perception is modulated by immediately prior visual experience, visual cortical neurons may register recent visual history into a specific form of offline activity and link it to later visual input. To examine how preceding visual inputs interact with upcoming information at the single neuron level, we designed a simple stimulation protocol in which a brief, orientated flashing stimulus was subsequently coupled to visual stimuli with identical or different features. Using in vivo whole-cell patch-clamp recording and functional two-photon calcium imaging from the primary visual cortex (V1) of awake mice, we discovered that a flash of sinusoidal grating per se induces an early, transient activation as well as a long-delayed reactivation in V1 neurons. This late response, which started hundreds of milliseconds after the flash and persisted for approximately 2 s, was also observed in human V1 electroencephalogram. When another drifting grating stimulus arrived during the late response, the V1 neurons exhibited a sublinear, but apparently increased response, especially to the same grating orientation. In behavioral tests of mice and humans, the flashing stimulation enhanced the detection power of the identically orientated visual stimulation only when the second stimulation was presented during the time window of the late response. Therefore, V1 late responses likely provide a neural basis for admixing temporally separated stimuli and extracting identical features in time-varying visual environments.","[Funayama, Kenta; Minamisawa, Genki; Matsumoto, Nobuyoshi; Matsuki, Norio; Ikegaya, Yuji] Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Pharmaceut Sci, Chem Pharmacol Lab, Bunkyo Ku, Tokyo, Japan; [Ban, Hiroshi; Ikegaya, Yuji] Natl Inst Informat & Communicat Technol, Ctr Informat & Neural Networks, Suita, Osaka, Japan; [Ban, Hiroshi] Osaka Univ, Grad Sch Frontier Biosci, Suita, Osaka, Japan; [Chan, Allen W.; Murphy, Timothy H.] Univ British Columbia, Dept Psychiat, Vancouver, BC, Canada","Funayama, K (reprint author), Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Pharmaceut Sci, Chem Pharmacol Lab, Bunkyo Ku, Tokyo, Japan.",ikegaya@mol.f.u-tokyo.ac.jp,,,"Strategic Research Program for Brain Sciences on the ""Development of BMI Technologies for Clinical Application"";  [22115003];  [25119004]","This work was supported by Grants-in-Aid for Science Research on Innovative Areas, ""Mesoscopic Neurocircuitry"" (22115003) and ""Mental Time"" (25119004) and the Strategic Research Program for Brain Sciences on the ""Development of BMI Technologies for Clinical Application"".

Many studies have established the relevance of firing rate modulation after informative events signaling whether and how to update the behavioral policy. However, whether the spatiotemporal features of these neuronal activities contribute to encoding imminent behavioral updates remains unclear. We investigated this issue in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) of monkeys while they adapted their behavior based on their memory of feedback from past choices. We analyzed spike trains of both single units and pairs of simultaneously recorded neurons using an algorithm that emulates different biologically plausible decoding circuits. This method permits the assessment of the performance of both spike-count and spike-timing sensitive decoders. In response to the feedback, single neurons emitted stereotypical spike trains whose temporal structure identified informative events with higher accuracy than mere spike count. The optimal decoding time scale was in the range of 70-200 ms, which is significantly shorter than the memory time scale required by the behavioral task. Importantly, the temporal spiking patterns of single units were predictive of the monkeys' behavioral response time. Furthermore, some features of these spiking patterns often varied between jointly recorded neurons. All together, our results suggest that dACC drives behavioral adaptation through complex spatiotemporal spike coding. They also indicate that downstream networks, which decode dACC feedback signals, are unlikely to act as mere neural integrators.","[Logiaco, Laureline; Arleo, Angelo] INSERM, U968, Paris, France; [Logiaco, Laureline; Arleo, Angelo] Univ Paris 06, Inst Vis, UMR S 968, Sorbonne Univ, Paris, France; [Logiaco, Laureline; Arleo, Angelo] CNRS, UMR 7210, Paris, France; [Quilodran, Rene] Univ Valparaiso, Escuela Med, Dept Preclin, Valparaiso, Chile; [Procyk, Emmanuel] INSERM, Stem Cell & Brain Res Inst, U846, F-69500 Bron, France; [Procyk, Emmanuel] Univ Lyon 1, F-69365 Lyon, France","Logiaco, L (reprint author), INSERM, U968, Paris, France.",laureline.logiaco@epfl.ch; angelo.arleo@upmc.fr,"procyk, emmanuel/H-3037-2014; Arleo, Angelo/N-9255-2019","procyk, emmanuel/0000-0001-7486-4993; Arleo, Angelo/0000-0002-1990-1971","Ecole Normale Superieure (ENS) Paris, France; NRJ foundation; Region Rhone-Alpes; Agence National de la Recherche [ANR-06-JCJC-0048]; labex CORTEX [ANR-11-LABX-0042]; Facultad de Medicina Universidad de Valparaiso, projecto MECESUP [UVA-106]; Fondation pour la Recherche Medicale","LL's PhD fellowship was funded by the Ecole Normale Superieure (ENS) Paris, France.

Although organ scaling is fundamental for development and function, little is known about the mechanisms that regulate it. Bone superstructures are projections that typically serve for tendon and ligament insertion or articulation and, therefore, their position along the bone is crucial for musculoskeletal functionality. As bones are rigid structures that elongate only from their ends, it is unclear how superstructure positions are regulated during growth to end up in the right locations. Here, we document the process of longitudinal scaling in developing mouse long bones and uncover the mechanism that regulates it. To that end, we performed a computational analysis of hundreds of three-dimensional micro-CT images, using a newly developed method for recovering the morphogenetic sequence of developing bones. Strikingly, analysis revealed that the relative position of all superstructures along the bone is highly preserved during more than a 5-fold increase in length, indicating isometric scaling. It has been suggested that during development, bone superstructures are continuously reconstructed and relocated along the shaft, a process known as drift. Surprisingly, our results showed that most superstructures did not drift at all. Instead, we identified a novel mechanism for bone scaling, whereby each bone exhibits a specific and unique balance between proximal and distal growth rates, which accurately maintains the relative position of its superstructures. Moreover, we show mathematically that this mechanism minimizes the cumulative drift of all superstructures, thereby optimizing the scaling process. Our study reveals a general mechanism for the scaling of developing bones. More broadly, these findings suggest an evolutionary mechanism that facilitates variability in bone morphology by controlling the activity of individual epiphyseal plates.","[Stern, Tomer; Aviram, Rona; Rot, Chagai; Sharir, Amnon; Zelzer, Elazar] Weizmann Inst Sci, Dept Mol Genet, IL-76100 Rehovot, Israel; [Galili, Tal] Tel Aviv Univ, Dept Stat & Operat Res, IL-69978 Tel Aviv, Israel; [Sharir, Amnon; Achrai, Noga Kalish; Shahar, Ron] Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Koret Sch Vet Med, Robert H Smith Fac Agr Food & Environm, Lab Bone Biomech, IL-76100 Rehovot, Israel; [Keller, Yosi] Bar Ilan Univ, Fac Engn, Ramat Gan, Israel","Stern, T (reprint author), Weizmann Inst Sci, Dept Mol Genet, IL-76100 Rehovot, Israel.",tomer.stern@weizmann.ac.il; eli.zelzer@weizmann.ac.il,,"Galili, Tal/0000-0003-0046-7332",European Research Council under the European Union's Seventh Framework Programme / ERC [310098]; Jeanne and Joseph Nissim Foundation for Life Sciences Research; Irving and Dorothy Rom Charitable Trust; Estate of David Levinson,"The research leading to these results has received funding from the European Research Council under the European Union's Seventh Framework Programme (FP7/2007-2013) / ERC grant agreement no 310098, the Jeanne and Joseph Nissim Foundation for Life Sciences Research, the Irving and Dorothy Rom Charitable Trust, and the Estate of David Levinson.

They double an organism's genetic content, immediately creating a reproductive barrier between it and its ancestors and providing raw material for the divergence of gene functions between paralogs. Almost all eukaryotic genome sequences bear evidence of ancient WGDs, but the causes of these events and the timing of intermediate steps have been difficult to discern. One of the best-characterized WGDs occurred in the lineage leading to the baker's yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Marcet-Houben and Gabaldon now show that, rather than simply doubling the DNA of a single ancestor, the yeast WGD likely involved mating between two different ancestral species followed by a doubling of the genome to restore fertility.","Univ Coll Dublin, Sch Med & Med Sci, UCD Conway Inst, Dublin 2, Ireland","Wolfe, KH (reprint author), Univ Coll Dublin, Sch Med & Med Sci, UCD Conway Inst, Dublin 2, Ireland.",kenneth.wolfe@ucd.ie,,"Wolfe, Kenneth/0000-0003-4992-4979",,,,34,36,39,1,18,PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE,SAN FRANCISCO,"1160 BATTERY STREET, STE 100, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94111 USA",1545-7885,,,PLOS BIOL,PLoS.

SSA is promoted by proteins (single-strand-annealing proteins [SSAPs]), such as eukaryotic RAD52 and lambda phage Red beta. These proteins use a short single-stranded region to find sequence identity and initiate homologous recombination. However, it is unclear how SSAPs detect homology and catalyze annealing. Using single-molecule experiments, we provide evidence that homology is recognized by Red beta monomers that weakly hold single DNA strands together. Once annealing begins, dimerization of Red beta clamps the double-stranded region and nucleates nucleoprotein filament growth. In this manner, DNA clamping ensures and secures a successful detection for DNA sequence homology. The clamp is characterized by a structural change of Red beta and a remarkable stability against force up to 200 pN. Our findings not only present a detailed explanation for SSAP action but also identify the DNA clamp as a very stable, noncovalent, DNA-protein interaction.","[Ander, Marcel; Schaeffer, Erik] Tech Univ Dresden, Nanomech Grp, Ctr Biotechnol, Dresden, Germany; [Subramaniam, Sivaraman; Stewart, A.

To fully appreciate the change that the field is now undergoing, one has to place the epochs and foundational principles of Darwin, Mendel, and the modern synthesis in light of the current advances that are enabling a new vision for the central importance of microbiology. Animals and plants are no longer heralded as autonomous entities but rather as biomolecular networks composed of the host plus its associated microbes, i.e., ""holobionts."" As such, their collective genomes forge a ""hologenome,"" and models of animal and plant biology that do not account for these intergenomic associations are incomplete. Here, we integrate these concepts into historical and contemporary visions of biology and summarize a predictive and refutable framework for their evaluation. Specifically, we present ten principles that clarify and append what these concepts are and are not, explain how they both support and extend existing theory in the life sciences, and discuss their potential ramifications for the multifaceted approaches of zoology and botany. We anticipate that the conceptual and evidence-based foundation provided in this essay will serve as a roadmap for hypothesis-driven, experimentally validated research on holobionts and their hologenomes, thereby catalyzing the continued fusion of biology's subdisciplines. At a time when symbiotic microbes are recognized as fundamental to all aspects of animal and plant biology, the holobiont and hologenome concepts afford a holistic view of biological complexity that is consistent with the generally reductionist approaches of biology.","[Bordenstein, Seth R.] Vanderbilt Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Nashville, TN 37235 USA; [Bordenstein, Seth R.] Vanderbilt Univ, Dept Pathol Microbiol & Immunol, Nashville, TN 37235 USA; [Theis, Kevin R.] Univ Michigan, Dept Internal Med, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA","Bordenstein, SR (reprint author), Vanderbilt Univ, Dept Biol Sci, 221 Kirkland Hall, Nashville, TN 37235 USA.",s.bordenstein@vanderbilt.edu,,,"National Science Foundation [DEB 1046149, IOS 1456778, IOS 0920505]; BEACON Center for the Study of Evolution in Action (National Science Foundation) [DBI 0939454]","This publication was made possible by National Science Foundation (http://www.nsf.gov) grants DEB 1046149 and IOS 1456778 to SRB, and IOS 0920505 to KRT.

A growing number of parents are expressing concerns about the safety of vaccines, often fueled by misinformation from the internet, books, and other nonmedical sources. Many of these concerned parents are choosing to refuse or delay childhood vaccines, placing their children and surrounding communities at risk for serious diseases that are nearly 100% preventable with vaccination. Between 10% and 15% of parents are asking physicians to space out the timing of vaccines, which often poses an ethical dilemma for physicians. This trend reflects a tension between personal liberty and public health, as parents fight to control the decisions that affect the health of their children and public health officials strive to maintain high immunization rates to prevent outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases. Interventions to address this emerging public health issue are needed.

We propose that the genome doubling was a direct consequence of this hybridization and that it served to provide stability to the recently formed allopolyploid.

Recent whole-genome sequence analyses have much improved the resolution of the neoavian radiation and suggest concurrence with the Cretaceous-Paleogene (K-Pg) boundary, yet the causes of the remaining genome-level irresolvabilities appear unclear. Here we show that genome-level analyses of 2,118 retrotransposon presence/absence markers converge at a largely consistent Neoaves phylogeny and detect a highly differential temporal prevalence of incomplete lineage sorting (ILS), i.e., the persistence of ancestral genetic variation as polymorphisms during speciation events. We found that ILS-derived incongruences are spread over the genome and involve 35% and 34% of the analyzed loci on the autosomes and the Z chromosome, respectively. Surprisingly, Neoaves diversification comprises three adaptive radiations, an initial near-K-Pg super-radiation with highly discordant phylogenetic signals from near-simultaneous speciation events, followed by two post-K-Pg radiations of core landbirds and core waterbirds with much less pronounced ILS. We provide evidence that, given the extreme level of up to 100% ILS per branch in super-radiations, particularly rapid speciation events may neither resemble a fully bifurcating tree nor are they resolvable as such. As a consequence, their complex demographic history is more accurately represented as local networks within a species tree.","[Suh, Alexander; Smeds, Linnea; Ellegren, Hans] Uppsala Univ, Dept Evolutionary Biol, Evolutionary Biol Ctr, Uppsala, Sweden","Suh, A (reprint author), Uppsala Univ, Dept Evolutionary Biol, Evolutionary Biol Ctr, Uppsala, Sweden.",alexander.suh@ebc.uu.se,,"Suh, Alexander/0000-0002-8979-9992; Smeds, Linnea/0000-0002-8415-9259","European Research Council; Wallenberg Scholar Award from Knut and Alice Wallenberg Foundation; Swedish Research Council [2007-8731, 2010-5650]; Swedish National Infrastructure for Computing (SNIC) through Uppsala Multidisciplinary Center for Advanced Computational Science (UPPMAX) [b2012135]","This work was supported by an Advanced Investigator Grant (NEXTGENMOLECOL) from the European Research Council, a Wallenberg Scholar Award from the Knut and Alice Wallenberg Foundation and grants from the Swedish Research Council (2007-8731 and 2010-5650) to HE.

The transcription factor Pax6 is known to be highly expressed in primate, but not mouse, BPs. Here, we demonstrate that sustaining Pax6 expression selectively in BP-genic apical radial glia (aRG) and their BP progeny of embryonic mouse neocortex suffices to induce primate-like progenitor behaviour. Specifically, we conditionally expressed Pax6 by in utero electroporation using a novel, Tis21-CreER(T2) mouse line. This expression altered aRG cleavage plane orientation to promote bRG generation, increased cell-cycle re-entry of BPs, and ultimately increased upper-layer neuron production. Upper-layer neuron production was also increased in double-transgenic mouse embryos with sustained Pax6 expression in the neurogenic lineage. Strikingly, increased BPs existed not only in the SVZ but also in the intermediate zone of the neocortex of these double-transgenic mouse embryos. In mutant mouse embryos lacking functional Pax6, the proportion of bRG among BPs was reduced. Our data identify specific Pax6 effects in BPs and imply that sustaining this Pax6 function in BPs could be a key aspect of SVZ enlargement and, consequently, the evolutionary expansion of the neocortex.","[Wong, Fong Kuan; Fei, Ji-Feng; Mora-Bermudez, Felipe; Taverna, Elena; Haffner, Christiane; Huttner, Wieland B.] Max Planck Inst Mol Cell Biol & Genet, Dresden, Germany; [Fu, Jun; Anastassiadis, Konstantinos; Stewart, A.

However, the mechanisms regulating netrin and its receptors in the extracellular milieu are largely unknown. Here we demonstrate that in Caenorhabditis elegans, LON-2/glypican, a heparan sulfate proteoglycan, modulates UNC-6/netrin signaling and may do this through interactions with the UNC-40/DCC receptor. We show that developing axons misorient in the absence of LON-2/glypican when the SLT-1/slit guidance pathway is compromised and that LON-2/glypican functions in both the attractive and repulsive UNC-6/netrin pathways. We find that the core LON-2/glypican protein, lacking its heparan sulfate chains, and secreted forms of LON-2/glypican are functional in axon guidance. We also find that LON-2/glypican functions from the epidermal substrate cells to guide axons, and we provide evidence that LON-2/glypican associates with UNC-40/DCC receptor-expressing cells. We propose that LON-2/glypican acts as a modulator of UNC-40/DCC-mediated guidance to fine-tune axonal responses to UNC-6/netrin signals during migration.","[Blanchette, Cassandra R.; Perrat, Paola N.; Thackeray, Andrea; Benard, Claire Y.] Univ Massachusetts, Sch Med, Dept Neurobiol, Worcester, MA 01655 USA","Blanchette, CR (reprint author), Univ Massachusetts, Sch Med, Dept Neurobiol, Worcester, MA 01655 USA.",claire.benard@umassmed.edu,"Benard, Claire/I-7526-2015",,"National Institute of Health [R01, AG041870-01A1]","This work was supported by R01 grant AG041870-01A1 from the National Institute of Health to CYB. http://www.nih.gov/ The funders had no role in study design, data collection and analysis, decision to publish, or preparation of the manuscript.",,61,16,17,0,5,PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE,SAN FRANCISCO,"1160 BATTERY STREET, STE 100, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94111 USA",1545-7885,,,PLOS BIOL,PLoS.

The traditional paradigm of sharing scientific knowledge through publications is not sufficient to meet contemporary demands that require not only the results but also data, knowledge, and skills to analyze the data. E-infrastructures are key in facilitating access to data and providing the framework for collaboration. Here we discuss the importance of e-infrastructures of public interest and the lack of long-term funding policies. We present the example of Brazil's speciesLink network, an e-infrastructure that provides free and open access to biodiversity primary data and associated tools. SpeciesLink currently integrates 382 datasets from 135 national institutions and 13 institutions from abroad, openly sharing similar to 7.4 million records, 94% of which are associated to voucher specimens. Just as important as the data is the network of data providers and users. In 2014, more than 95% of its users were from Brazil, demonstrating the importance of local e-infrastructures in enabling and promoting local use of biodiversity data and knowledge. From the outset, speciesLink has been sustained through project-based funding, normally public grants for 2-4-year periods. In between projects, there are short-term crises in trying to keep the system operational, a fact that has also been observed in global biodiversity portals, as well as in social and physical sciences platforms and even in computing services portals. In the last decade, the open access movement propelled the development of many web platforms for sharing data. Adequate policies unfortunately did not follow the same tempo, and now many initiatives may perish.","[Canhos, Dora A.

Recent findings have identified lactate as an active metabolite in cell signalling, although its effects on immune cells during inflammation are largely unexplored. Here we ask whether lactate is responsible for T cells remaining entrapped in inflammatory sites, where they perpetuate the chronic inflammatory process. We show that lactate accumulates in the synovia of rheumatoid arthritis patients. Extracellular sodium lactate and lactic acid inhibit the motility of CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells, respectively. This selective control of T cell motility is mediated via subtype-specific transporters (Slc5a12 and Slc16a1) that we find selectively expressed by CD4(+) and CD8(+) subsets, respectively. We further show both in vitro and in vivo that the sodium lactate-mediated inhibition of CD4(+) T cell motility is due to an interference with glycolysis activated upon engagement of the chemokine receptor CXCR3 with the chemokine CXCL10. In contrast, we find the lactic acid effect on CD8(+) T cell motility to be independent of glycolysis control. In CD4(+) T helper cells, sodium lactate also induces a switch towards the Th17 subset that produces large amounts of the proinflammatory cytokine IL-17, whereas in CD8(+) T cells, lactic acid causes the loss of their cytolytic function. We further show that the expression of lactate transporters correlates with the clinical T cell score in the synovia of rheumatoid arthritis patients. Finally, pharmacological or antibody-mediated blockade of subtype-specific lactate transporters on T cells results in their release from the inflammatory site in an in vivo model of peritonitis. By establishing a novel role of lactate in control of proinflammatory T cell motility and effector functions, our findings provide a potential molecular mechanism for T cell entrapment and functional changes in inflammatory sites that drive chronic inflammation and offer targeted therapeutic interventions for the treatment of chronic inflammatory disorders.","[Haas, Robert; Smith, Joanne; Rocher-Ros, Vidalba; Nadkarni, Suchita; Montero-Melendez, Trinidad; D'Acquisto, Fulvio; Bombardieri, Michele; Pitzalis, Costantino; Perretti, Mauro; Marelli-Berg, Federica M.; Mauro, Claudio] Barts & London Queen Marys Sch Med & Dent, William Harvey Res Inst, London, England; [Bland, Elliot J.] Queen Mary Univ London, Queen Mary Innovat Ltd, London, England","Haas, R (reprint author), Barts & London Queen Marys Sch Med & Dent, William Harvey Res Inst, London, England.",c.mauro@qmul.ac.uk,,"Montero-Melendez, Trinidad/0000-0002-3563-376X","Medical Research Council, UK; Immune Systems Research Theme at Barts; London SMD; Queen Mary Innovation Ltd; British Heart Foundation Fellowship [FS/12/38/29640]; British Heart Foundation [FS/12/38/29640, RG/14/2/30616]; Medical Research Council [G0901084, 1263270, MR/K020250/1]","RH is supported by a PhD studentship from the Medical Research Council, UK (http://www.mrc.ac.uk/).

Also, the Arabidopsis thaliana BDCP SPIRRIG (SPI) is important for membrane integrity, as spi mutants exhibit split vacuoles. In this work, we report a novel molecular function of the BDCP SPI in ribonucleoprotein particle formation. We show that SPI interacts with the P-body core component DECAPPING PROTEIN 1 (DCP1), associates to mRNA processing bodies (P-bodies), and regulates their assembly upon salt stress. The finding that spi mutants exhibit salt hypersensitivity suggests that the local function of SPI at P-bodies is of biological relevance. Transcriptome-wide analysis revealed qualitative differences in the salt stress-regulated transcriptional response of Col-0 and spi. We show that SPI regulates the salt stress-dependent post-transcriptional stabilization, cytoplasmic agglomeration, and localization to P-bodies of a subset of salt stress-regulated mRNAs. Finally, we show that the PH-BEACH domains of SPI and its human homolog FAN (Factor Associated with Neutral sphingomyelinase activation) interact with DCP1 isoforms from plants, mammals, and yeast, suggesting the evolutionary conservation of an association of BDCPs and P-bodies.","[Steffens, Alexandra; Jakoby, Marc; Huelskamp, Martin] Univ Cologne, Inst Bot, Bioctr, Cologne, Germany; [Braeutigam, Andrea] Univ Dusseldorf, Inst Plant Biochem, Cluster Excellence Plant Sci CEPLAS, Dusseldorf, Germany; [Braeutigam, Andrea] Univ Dusseldorf, Plant Biochem, Dusseldorf, Germany","Steffens, A (reprint author), Univ Cologne, Inst Bot, Bioctr, Gyrhofstr 15, Cologne, Germany.",martin.huelskamp@uni-koeln.de,,"Hulskamp, Martin/0000-0003-4165-6754; Brautigam, Andrea/0000-0002-5309-0527",Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft [Sonderforschungsprogram 635],"This work was supported by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, Priority Program Sonderforschungsprogram 635 to MH.

Although literacy development proceeds smoothly for many children, a subset struggle with this learning process, creating a need to identify reliable biomarkers of a child's future literacy that could facilitate early diagnosis and access to crucial early interventions. Neural markers of reading skills have been identified in school-aged children and adults; many pertain to the precision of information processing in noise, but it is unknown whether these markers are present in pre-reading children. Here, in a series of experiments in 112 children ( ages 3-14 y), we show brain-behavior relationships between the integrity of the neural coding of speech in noise and phonology. We harness these findings into a predictive model of preliteracy, revealing that a 30-min neurophysiological assessment predicts performance on multiple pre-reading tests and, one year later, predicts preschoolers' performance across multiple domains of emergent literacy. This same neural coding model predicts literacy and diagnosis of a learning disability in school-aged children. These findings offer new insight into the biological constraints on preliteracy during early childhood, suggesting that neural processing of consonants in noise is fundamental for language and reading development. Pragmatically, these findings open doors to early identification of children at risk for language learning problems; this early identification may in turn facilitate access to early interventions that could prevent a life spent struggling to read.","[White-Schwoch, Travis; Carr, Kali Woodruff; Thompson, Elaine C.; Anderson, Samira; Nicol, Trent; Zecker, Steven G.; Kraus, Nina] Northwestern Univ, Auditory Neurosci Lab, Evanston, IL 60208 USA; [White-Schwoch, Travis; Carr, Kali Woodruff; Thompson, Elaine C.; Anderson, Samira; Nicol, Trent; Zecker, Steven G.; Kraus, Nina] Northwestern Univ, Dept Commun Sci, Evanston, IL USA; [Anderson, Samira] Univ Maryland, Dept Speech & Hearing Sci, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [Bradlow, Ann R.] Northwestern Univ, Dept Linguist, Chicago, IL 60611 USA; [Kraus, Nina] Northwestern Univ, Dept Neurobiol & Physiol, Evanston, IL 60208 USA; [Kraus, Nina] Northwestern Univ, Dept Otolaryngol, Chicago, IL 60611 USA","White-Schwoch, T (reprint author), Northwestern Univ, Auditory Neurosci Lab, Evanston, IL 60208 USA.",nkraus@northwestern.edu,,"Thompson, Elaine/0000-0003-1293-6247; Woodruff Carr, Kali/0000-0002-3142-0476","NIH [R01 HD069414, R01 DC01510]","This work was supported by NIH (R01 HD069414; http://www.nichd.nih.gov & R01 DC01510; http://www.nidcd.nih.gov) and the Knowles Hearing Center (http://knowleshearingcenter.northwestern.edu).

Using the RII beta holoenzyme as a prototype, we show how autophosphorylation/dephosphorylation of the RII beta subunit, as well as cAMP and metal ions, contribute to the dynamics of PKA signaling. While we showed previously that the RII beta holoenzyme could undergo a single turnover autophosphorylation with adenosine triphosphate and magnesium (MgATP) and trap both products in the crystal lattice, we asked here whether calcium could trap an ATP: RII beta holoenzyme since the RII beta holoenzyme is located close to ion channels. The 2.8 angstrom structure of an RII beta p(2):C-2:(Ca(2)ADP)(2) holoenzyme, supported by biochemical and biophysical data, reveals a trapped single phosphorylation event similar to MgATP. Thus, calcium can mediate a single turnover event with either ATP or adenosine-5'-(beta,gamma-imido) triphosphate (AMP-PNP), even though it cannot support steady-state catalysis efficiently. The holoenzyme serves as a ""product trap"" because of the slow off-rate of the pRII beta subunit, which is controlled by cAMP, not by phosphorylation of the inhibitor site. By quantitatively defining the RII beta signaling cycle, we show that release of pRII beta in the presence of cAMP is reduced by calcium, whereas autophosphorylation at the phosphorylation site (P-site) inhibits holoenzyme reassociation with the catalytic subunit. Adding a single phosphoryl group to the preformed RII beta holoenzyme thus creates a signaling cycle in which phosphatases become an essential partner. This previously unappreciated molecular mechanism is an integral part of PKA signaling for type II holoenzymes.","[Zhang, Ping; Ahuja, Lalima G.; Keshwani, Malik M.; Sastri, Mira; Taylor, Susan S.] Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Pharmacol, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Knape, Matthias J.; Herberg, Friedrich W.] Univ Kassel, Dept Biochem, D-34125 Kassel, Germany; [Ahuja, Lalima G.; Sastri, Mira; Taylor, Susan S.] Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Chem & Biochem, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [King, Charles C.] Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Pediat, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA","Zhang, P (reprint author), Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Pharmacol, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA.",herberg@uni-kassel.de; staylor@ucsd.edu,"Herberg, Friedrich W/B-5572-2015","Herberg, Friedrich W/0000-0001-7117-7653",National Institutes of Health [GM034921]; European Union FP7 Health Programme [241481]; Federal Ministry of Education and Research [0316177F],"This work was supported by the National Institutes of Health grant GM034921 (SST), European Union FP7 Health Programme, 241481 AFFINOMICS (FWH) and the Federal Ministry of Education and Research, fund number: 0316177F No Pain (FWH).

Among these, neuroimaging research installed the notion that speech and language require an orchestration of brain regions for comprehension, planning, and integration of a heard sound with a spoken word. However, these studies have been largely limited to mapping the neural correlates of separate speech elements and examining distinct cortical or subcortical circuits involved in different aspects of speech control. As a result, the complexity of the brain network machinery controlling speech and language remained largely unknown. Using graph theoretical analysis of functional MRI (fMRI) data in healthy subjects, we quantified the large-scale speech network topology by constructing functional brain networks of increasing hierarchy from the resting state to motor output of meaningless syllables to complex production of real-life speech as well as compared to non-speech-related sequential finger tapping and pure tone discrimination networks. We identified a segregated network of highly connected local neural communities (hubs) in the primary sensorimotor and parietal regions, which formed a commonly shared core hub network across the examined conditions, with the left area 4p playing an important role in speech network organization. These sensorimotor core hubs exhibited features of flexible hubs based on their participation in several functional domains across different networks and ability to adaptively switch long-range functional connectivity depending on task content, resulting in a distinct community structure of each examined network. Specifically, compared to other tasks, speech production was characterized by the formation of six distinct neural communities with specialized recruitment of the prefrontal cortex, insula, putamen, and thalamus, which collectively forged the formation of the functional speech connectome. In addition, the observed capacity of the primary sensorimotor cortex to exhibit operational heterogeneity challenged the established concept of unimodality of this region.","[Fuertinger, Stefan; Simonyan, Kristina] Icahn Sch Med Mt Sinai, Dept Neurol, New York, NY 10029 USA; [Horwitz, Barry] NIDCD, Brain Imaging & Modeling Sect, NIH, Bethesda, MD USA; [Simonyan, Kristina] Icahn Sch Med Mt Sinai, Dept Otolaryngol, New York, NY 10029 USA","Fuertinger, S (reprint author), Icahn Sch Med Mt Sinai, Dept Neurol, New York, NY 10029 USA.",kristina.simonyan@mssm.edu,"; Simonyan, Kristina/E-2511-2016","Fuertinger, Stefan/0000-0002-8118-036X; Simonyan, Kristina/0000-0001-7444-0437","National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders [R01DC011805, R01DC012545]; Intramural Program of the National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders","Supported by the grants from the National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders (R01DC011805 and R01DC012545) to KS and the Intramural Program of the National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders to BH.

Here, using text mining and a literature review, we find evidence that blind protocols are uncommon in the life sciences and that nonblind studies tend to report higher effect sizes and more significant p-values.

Although mitochondrial defects are often associated with oxidative stress, they have not been linked to Rhodopsin trafficking. In an unbiased forward genetic screen designed to isolate mutations that cause photoreceptor degeneration, we identified mutations in a nuclear-encoded mitochondrial gene, ppr, a homolog of human LRPPRC. We found that ppr is required for protection against light-induced degeneration. Its function is essential to maintain membrane depolarization of the photoreceptors upon repetitive light exposure, and an impaired phototransduction cascade in ppr mutants results in excessive Rhodopsin1 endocytosis. Moreover, loss of ppr results in a reduction in mitochondrial RNAs, reduced electron transport chain activity, and reduced ATP levels. Oxidative stress, however, is not induced. We propose that the reduced ATP level in ppr mutants underlies the phototransduction defect, leading to increased Rhodopsin1 endocytosis during light exposure, causing photoreceptor degeneration independent of oxidative stress. This hypothesis is bolstered by characterization of two other genes isolated in the screen, pyruvate dehydrogenase and citrate synthase. Their loss also causes a light-induced degeneration, excessive Rhodopsin1 endocytosis and reduced ATP without concurrent oxidative stress, unlike many other mutations in mitochondrial genes that are associated with elevated oxidative stress and light-independent photoreceptor demise.","[Jaiswal, Manish; Sandoval, Hector; Donti, Taraka; Yamamoto, Shinya; Graham, Brett H.; Bellen, Hugo J.] Baylor Coll Med, Dept Mol & Human Genet, Houston, TX 77030 USA; [Jaiswal, Manish; Bellen, Hugo J.] BCM, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Houston, TX USA; [Haelterman, Nele A.; Xiong, Bo; Yamamoto, Shinya; Cooper, Thomas A.; Bellen, Hugo J.] BCM, Program Dev Biol, Houston, TX USA; [Kalsotra, Auinash; Cooper, Thomas A.] BCM, Dept Pathol & Immunol, Houston, TX USA; [Yamamoto, Shinya; Bellen, Hugo J.] Texas Childrens Hosp, Jan & Dan Duncan Neurol Res Inst, Houston, TX 77030 USA; [Bellen, Hugo J.] BCM, Dept Neurosci, Houston, TX USA","Jaiswal, M (reprint author), Baylor Coll Med, Dept Mol & Human Genet, Houston, TX 77030 USA.",hbellen@bcm.edu,"Graham, Brett/R-8685-2018","Graham, Brett/0000-0001-8451-8154; Bellen, Hugo/0000-0001-5992-5989; Xiong, Bo/0000-0002-2695-9100; Sandoval, Hector/0000-0002-9186-7384; Jaiswal, Manish/0000-0001-8360-8289; Yamamoto, Shinya/0000-0003-2172-8036","NIH [1RC4GM096355-01, R01 HL126845, 5R01GM067858, T32 NS043124-11]; Robert and Renee Belfer Family Foundation; Huffington Foundation; Target ALS; Howard Hughes Medical Institute; Research Education and Career Horizon Institutional Research and Academic Career Development Award [5K12GM084897]; Jan and Dan Duncan Neurological Research Institute at Texas Children's Hospital, Houston; Baylor College of Medicine IDDRC from Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health & Human Development [1U54 HD083092]","HJB is a Howard Hughes Medical Institute Investigator (https://www.hhmi.org) and supported by NIH (1RC4GM096355-01), the Robert and Renee Belfer Family Foundation (http://www.insidephilanthropy.com/grants-for-diseases/robert-a-and-renee-e-belfer-family-foundation-grants-for-dis.html), the Huffington Foundation, and Target ALS.

Biofilm formation is commonly viewed as a cooperative enterprise, where strains and species work together for a common goal. Here we explore an alternative model: biofilm formation is a response to ecological competition. We co-cultured a diverse collection of natural isolates of the opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa and studied the effect on biofilm formation. We show that strain mixing reliably increases biofilm formation compared to unmixed conditions. Importantly, strain mixing leads to strong competition: one strain dominates and largely excludes the other from the biofilm. Furthermore, we show that pyocins, narrow-spectrum antibiotics made by other P. aeruginosa strains, can stimulate biofilm formation by increasing the attachment of cells. Side-by-side comparisons using microfluidic assays suggest that the increase in biofilm occurs due to a general response to cellular damage: a comparable biofilm response occurs for pyocins that disrupt membranes as for commercial antibiotics that damage DNA, inhibit protein synthesis or transcription. Our data show that bacteria increase biofilm formation in response to ecological competition that is detected by antibiotic stress.

Conventional wisdom is that natural selection will remove highly lethal pathogens if host death greatly reduces transmission. Vaccines that keep hosts alive but still allow transmission could thus allow very virulent strains to circulate in a population. Here we show experimentally that immunization of chickens against Marek's disease virus enhances the fitness of more virulent strains, making it possible for hyperpathogenic strains to transmit. Immunity elicited by direct vaccination or by maternal vaccination prolongs host survival but does not prevent infection, viral replication or transmission, thus extending the infectious periods of strains otherwise too lethal to persist.

For this reason, there is a tremendous medical interest in harnessing the beneficial effects of THC. Behavioral studies carried out in mice lacking 5-HT2A receptors (5-HT2AR) revealed a remarkable 5-HT2AR-dependent dissociation in the beneficial antinociceptive effects of THC and its detrimental amnesic properties. We found that specific effects of THC such as memory deficits, anxiolytic-like effects, and social interaction are under the control of 5HT(2A)R, but its acute hypolocomotor, hypothermic, anxiogenic, and antinociceptive effects are not. In biochemical studies, we show that CB1R and 5-HT2AR form heteromers that are expressed and functionally active in specific brain regions involved in memory impairment. Remarkably, our functional data shows that costimulation of both receptors by agonists reduces cell signaling, antagonist binding to one receptor blocks signaling of the interacting receptor, and heteromer formation leads to a switch in G-protein coupling for 5-HT2AR from Gq to Gi proteins. Synthetic peptides with the sequence of transmembrane helices 5 and 6 of CB1R, fused to a cell-penetrating peptide, were able to disrupt receptor heteromerization in vivo, leading to a selective abrogation of memory impairments caused by exposure to THC. These data reveal a novel molecular mechanism for the functional interaction between CB1R and 5-HT2AR mediating cognitive impairment. CB1R-5-HT2AR heteromers are thus good targets to dissociate the cognitive deficits induced by THC from its beneficial antinociceptive properties.","[Vinals, Xavier; Maldonado, Rafael; Robledo, Patricia] Univ Pompeu Fabra, Neuropharmacol Lab, Barcelona, Spain; [Moreno, Estefania; Gasperini, Paola; Navarro, Gemma; Lluis, Carmen; Canela, Enric I.; McCormick, Peter J.] Ctr Invest Biomed Red Enfermedades Neurodegenerat, Barcelona, Spain; [Moreno, Estefania; Gasperini, Paola; Navarro, Gemma; Lluis, Carmen; Canela, Enric I.; McCormick, Peter J.] Univ Barcelona, Fac Biol, Dept Biochem & Mol Biol, Barcelona, Spain; [Moreno, Estefania] Univ Paris 05, UMR S894, INSERM UMR S894, CPN, Paris, France; [Cordomi, Arnau; Pardo, Leonardo] Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Fac Med, Unitat Bioestadist, Lab Med Computac, Bellaterra, Spain; [Pastor, Antoni; de La Torre, Rafael; Robledo, Patricia] IMIM, Hosp del Mar, Med Res Inst, Integrat Pharmacol & Syst Neurosci, Barcelona, Spain; [Gasperini, Paola; Howell, Lesley A.; McCormick, Peter J.] Univ E Anglia, Sch Pharm, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England","Vinals, X (reprint author), Univ Pompeu Fabra, Neuropharmacol Lab, Barcelona, Spain.",p.mccormick@uea.ac.uk; rafael.maldonado@upf.edu; probledo@imim.es,"Lanfumey, Laurence/P-3037-2017; Maldonado, Rafael/F-5657-2014; Canela, Enric I.

Here we use a metagenomic approach to identify more than 20 previously undetected RNA viruses and a DNA virus associated with wild D. melanogaster. These viruses not only include distant relatives of known insect pathogens but also novel groups of insect-infecting viruses. By sequencing virus-derived small RNAs, we show that the viruses represent active infections of Drosophila. We find that the RNA viruses differ in the number and properties of their small RNAs, and we detect both siRNAs and a novel miRNA from the DNA virus. Analysis of small RNAs also allows us to identify putative viral sequences that lack detectable sequence similarity to known viruses. By surveying > 2,000 individually collected wild adult Drosophila we show that more than 30% of D. melanogaster carry a detectable virus, and more than 6% carry multiple viruses. However, despite a high prevalence of the Wolbachia endosymbiont-which is known to be protective against virus infections in Drosophila-we were unable to detect any relationship between the presence of Wolbachia and the presence of any virus. Using publicly available RNA-seq datasets, we show that the community of viruses in Drosophila laboratories is very different from that seen in the wild, but that some of the newly discovered viruses are nevertheless widespread in laboratory lines and are ubiquitous in cell culture. By sequencing viruses from individual wild-collected flies we show that some viruses are shared between D. melanogaster and D. simulans. Our results provide an essential evolutionary and ecological context for host-virus interaction in Drosophila, and the newly reported viral sequences will help develop D. melanogaster further as a model for molecular and evolutionary virus research.","[Webster, Claire L.; Waldron, Fergal M.; Robertson, Shaun; Crowson, Daisy; Ferrari, Giada; Brouqui, Jean-Michel; Longdon, Ben; Haddrill, Penelope R.; Obbard, Darren J.] Univ Edinburgh, Inst Evolutionary Biol, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland; [Webster, Claire L.; Waldron, Fergal M.; Robertson, Shaun; Crowson, Daisy; Ferrari, Giada; Quintana, Juan F.; Brouqui, Jean-Michel; Longdon, Ben; Buck, Amy H.; Haddrill, Penelope R.; Obbard, Darren J.] Univ Edinburgh, Ctr Immun Infect & Evolut, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland; [Quintana, Juan F.; Buck, Amy H.] Univ Edinburgh, Inst Immun & Infect Res, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland; [Bayne, Elizabeth H.] Univ Edinburgh, Inst Cell Biol, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland; [Lazzaro, Brian P.] Cornell Univ, Dept Entomol, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Akorli, Jewelna] Univ Ghana, Noguchi Mem Inst Med Res, Dept Parasitol, Accra, Ghana","Webster, CL (reprint author), Univ Edinburgh, Inst Evolutionary Biol, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland.",darren.obbard@ed.ac.uk,"Bayne, Elizabeth/G-5411-2010; Waldron, Fergal/E-8599-2011; Obbard, Darren/A-9235-2008; Haddrill, Penelope R/H-4439-2011; Ferrari, Giada/V-2959-2019; Longdon, Ben/F-4132-2010","Bayne, Elizabeth/0000-0001-8775-999X; Waldron, Fergal/0000-0003-2622-0776; Obbard, Darren/0000-0001-5392-8142; Ferrari, Giada/0000-0002-0850-1518; Longdon, Ben/0000-0001-6936-1697; Buck, Amy/0000-0003-2645-7191; Akorli, Jewelna/0000-0002-3972-0860",Wellcome Trust Research Career Development Fellowship [WT085064]; Wellcome Trust [WT095831]; UK Natural Environment Research Council [NE/G013195/1]; Natural Environment Research Council [NE/G013195/1],"This work was funded by a Wellcome Trust Research Career Development Fellowship (WT085064; http://www.wellcome.ac.uk/) to DJO, and work in DJO's and AHB's labs is supported by a Wellcome Trust strategic award to the Centre for Immunity, Infection and Evolution (WT095831; http://www.wellcome.ac.uk/).

However, the mechanism by which EcR integrates nutritional and developmental cues to correctly activate transcription remains poorly understood. Here, we show that EcR-dependent transcription, and thus, developmental timing in Drosophila, is regulated by CDK8 and its regulatory partner Cyclin C (CycC), and the level of CDK8 is affected by nutrient availability. We observed that cdk8 and cycC mutants resemble EcR mutants and EcR-target genes are systematically down-regulated in both mutants. Indeed, the ability of the EcR-Ultraspiracle (USP) heterodimer to bind to polytene chromosomes and the promoters of EcR target genes is also diminished. Mass spectrometry analysis of proteins that co-immunoprecipitate with EcR and USP identified multiple Mediator subunits, including CDK8 and CycC. Consistently, CDK8-CycC interacts with EcR-USP in vivo; in particular, CDK8 and Med14 can directly interact with the AF1 domain of EcR. These results suggest that CDK8-CycC may serve as transcriptional cofactors for EcR-dependent transcription. During the larval-pupal transition, the levels of CDK8 protein positively correlate with EcR and USP levels, but inversely correlate with the activity of sterol regulatory element binding protein (SREBP), the master regulator of intracellular lipid homeostasis. Likewise, starvation of early third instar larvae precociously increases the levels of CDK8, EcR and USP, yet down-regulates SREBP activity. Conversely, refeeding the starved larvae strongly reduces CDK8 levels but increases SREBP activity. Importantly, these changes correlate with the timing for the larval-pupal transition. Taken together, these results suggest that CDK8-CycC links nutrient intake to developmental transitions (EcR activity) and fat metabolism (SREBP activity) during the larval-pupal transition.","[Xie, Xiao-Jun; Hsu, Fu-Ning; Gao, Xinsheng; Xing, Yue; Hsiao, Hao-Ching; Zheng, Yani; Bondos, Sarah E.; Ji, Jun-Yuan] Texas A&M Univ, Coll Med, Hlth Sci Ctr, Dept Mol & Cellular Med, College Stn, TX 77843 USA; [Xu, Wu; Huang, Liying] Univ Louisiana Lafayette, Dept Chem, Los Angeles, CA USA; [Ni, Jian-Quan] Tsinghua Univ, Sch Med, Gene Regulatory Lab, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China; [Zheng, Haiyan] Robert Wood Johnson Med Sch, Biol Mass Spectrometry Facil, Piscataway, NJ USA; [Zheng, Haiyan] Rutgers State Univ, Piscataway, NJ USA; [Wang, Chenguang] Key Lab Tianjin Radiat & Mol Nucl Med, Tianjin, Peoples R China; [Wang, Chenguang] Peking Union Med Coll, Inst Radiat Med, Tianjin, Peoples R China; [Wang, Chenguang] Chinese Acad Med Sci, Tianjin, Peoples R China; [Xiaoli, Alus M.; Yang, Fajun] Albert Einstein Coll Med, Diabet Res & Training Ctr, Dept Med, Div Endocrinol, Bronx, NY 10467 USA; [Bondos, Sarah E.] Rice Univ, Dept Biosci, Houston, TX USA","Xie, XJ (reprint author), Texas A&M Univ, Coll Med, Hlth Sci Ctr, Dept Mol & Cellular Med, College Stn, TX 77843 USA.",ji@medicine.tamhsc.edu,,,American Heart Association [11SDG7590123]; NIH NIDDK [1R01DK095013],"This work was supported by grants from the American Heart Association (11SDG7590123) and the NIH NIDDK (1R01DK095013) to JYJ.

Furthermore, it was not reducible to activity in traditional ""emotion-related"" regions (e.g., amygdala, insula) or resting-state networks (e.g., ""salience,"" ""default mode"").

Ca2+ is a major upstream effector in this transduction cascade, serving both as a depolarising electrical charge carrier at the membrane and an intracellular second messenger. Upon action potential firing, the majority of spines are subject to global back-propagating action potential (bAP) Ca2+ transients. These transients translate neuronal suprathreshold activation into intracellular biochemical events. Using a combination of electrophysiology, two-photon Ca2+ imaging, and modelling, we demonstrate that bAPs are electrochemically coupled to Ca2+ release from intracellular stores via ryanodine receptors (RyRs). We describe a new function mediated by spine RyRs: the activity-dependent long-term enhancement of the bAP-Ca2+ transient. Spines regulate bAP Ca2+ influx independent of each other, as bAP-Ca2+ transient enhancement is compartmentalized and independent of the dendritic Ca2+ transient. Furthermore, this functional state change depends exclusively on bAPs travelling antidromically into dendrites and spines. Induction, but not expression, of bAP-Ca2+ transient enhancement is a spine-specific function of the RyR. We demonstrate that RyRs can form specific Ca2+ signalling nanodomains within single spines. Functionally, RyR mediated Ca2+ release in these nanodomains induces a new form of Ca2+ transient plasticity that constitutes a spine specific storage mechanism of neuronal suprathreshold activity patterns.","[Johenning, Friedrich W.; Theis, Anne-Kathrin; Pannasch, Ulrike; Schmitz, Dietmar] Charite, Neurosci Res Ctr, D-13353 Berlin, Germany; [Johenning, Friedrich W.] BIH, Berlin, Germany; [Rueckl, Martin; Ruediger, Sten] Humboldt Univ, Inst Phys, D-10099 Berlin, Germany; [Schmitz, Dietmar] Bernstein Ctr Computat Neurosci, Berlin, Germany; [Schmitz, Dietmar] Charite, Cluster Excellence NeuroCure, D-13353 Berlin, Germany; [Schmitz, Dietmar] DZNE German Ctr Neurodegenerat Dis, Berlin, Germany","Johenning, FW (reprint author), Charite, Neurosci Res Ctr, D-13353 Berlin, Germany.",friedrich.johenning@charite.de,,,"German Research Foundation (DFG) [JO1079/1-1, RU 1660, IRTG 1740, Exc 257, SFB 665, SFB 958]; Berlin Institute of Health (BIH)","This work was supported by grants from the German Research Foundation (DFG, http://www.dfg.de) (grant number JO1079/1-1 to FWJ, RU 1660 and IRTG 1740 to SR, Exc 257, SFB 665 and SFB 958 to DS) and a grant from the Berlin Institute of Health (BIH, https://www.bihealth.org).

Anticipating the eradication of wild poliovirus (WPV) and the subsequent challenges in preventing its re-emergence, we look to the past to identify why polio rose to epidemic levels in the mid-20th century, and how WPV persisted over large geographic scales. We analyzed an extensive epidemiological dataset, spanning the 1930s to the 1950s and spatially replicated across each state in the United States, to glean insight into the drivers of polio's historical expansion and the ecological mode of its persistence prior to vaccine introduction. We document a latitudinal gradient in polio's seasonality. Additionally, we fitted and validated mechanistic transmission models to data from each US state independently. The fitted models revealed that: (1) polio persistence was the product of a dynamic mosaic of source and sink populations; (2) geographic heterogeneity of seasonal transmission conditions account for the latitudinal structure of polio epidemics; (3) contrary to the prevailing ""disease of development"" hypothesis, our analyses demonstrate that polio's historical expansion was straightforwardly explained by demographic trends rather than improvements in sanitation and hygiene; and (4) the absence of clinical disease is not a reliable indicator of polio transmission, because widespread polio transmission was likely in the multiyear absence of clinical disease. As the world edges closer to global polio eradication and continues the strategic withdrawal of the Oral Polio Vaccine (OPV), the regular identification of, and rapid response to, these silent chains of transmission is of the utmost importance.","[Martinez-Bakker, Micaela; King, Aaron A.; Rohani, Pejman] Univ Michigan, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [King, Aaron A.; Rohani, Pejman] Univ Michigan, Ctr Study Complex Syst, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [King, Aaron A.; Rohani, Pejman] NIH, Fogarty Int Ctr, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA","Martinez-Bakker, M (reprint author), Univ Michigan, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",bakkerma@umich.edu,"King, Aaron A/B-8092-2012; Martinez-Bakker, Micaela/J-3721-2013","King, Aaron A/0000-0001-6159-3207; Martinez-Bakker, Micaela/0000-0002-9248-9450","NSF Graduate Research Fellowship Program; University of Michigan Rackham Merit Fellowship; Research and Policy in Infectious Disease Dynamics program of the Science and Technology Directorate, Department of Homeland Security, the Fogarty International Center, National Institutes of Health; MIDAS, National Institute of General Medical Sciences [U54-GM111274, U01-GM110744]; National Center for Research Resources, a component of the National Institutes of Health [RR016466]","MMB is supported by the NSF Graduate Research Fellowship Program and the University of Michigan Rackham Merit Fellowship.

While there have been considerable advances in understanding the physical aspects of climate change, comprehensive analyses integrating climate, biological, and social sciences are less common. Here we use climate projections under alternative mitigation scenarios to show how changes in environmental variables that limit plant growth could impact ecosystems and people. We show that although the global mean number of days above freezing will increase by up to 7% by 2100 under ""business as usual"" (representative concentration pathway [RCP] 8.5), suitable growing days will actually decrease globally by up to 11% when other climatic variables that limit plant growth are considered (i.e., temperature, water availability, and solar radiation). Areas in Russia, China, and Canada are projected to gain suitable plant growing days, but the rest of the world will experience losses. Notably, tropical areas could lose up to 200 suitable plant growing days per year. These changes will impact most of the world's terrestrial ecosystems, potentially triggering climate feedbacks. Human populations will also be affected, with up to similar to 2,100 million of the poorest people in the world (similar to 30% of the world's population) highly vulnerable to changes in the supply of plant-related goods and services. These impacts will be spatially variable, indicating regions where adaptations will be necessary. Changes in suitable plant growing days are projected to be less severe under strong and moderate mitigation scenarios (i.e., RCP 2.6 and RCP 4.5), underscoring the importance of reducing emissions to avoid such disproportionate impacts on ecosystems and people.","[Mora, Camilo; Fisher, Micah R.; Genco, Brandon M.] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Dept Geog, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA; [Caldwell, Iain R.; Caldwell, Jamie M.] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Hawaii Inst Marine Biol, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA; [Running, Steven W.] Univ Montana, Sch Forestry, Missoula, MT 59812 USA","Mora, C (reprint author), Univ Hawaii Manoa, Dept Geog, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA.",cmora@hawaii.edu,,"Caldwell, Iain/0000-0001-8148-8762; Fisher, Micah/0000-0002-8246-2318","National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration - University of Hawaii Sea Grant College Program, SOEST under NOAA Office of Sea Grant, Department of Commerce [R/IR-31, NA14OAR4170071]","This paper was funded by a grant/cooperative agreement from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, Project R/IR-31, which is sponsored by the University of Hawaii Sea Grant College Program, SOEST, under Institutional Grant No. NA14OAR4170071 from NOAA Office of Sea Grant, Department of Commerce.

The critical relationship between lesion sites and impairments has not yet been given a clear mechanistic explanation. Although recent works proposed that a whole-brain network contains hubs that play integrative roles in cortical information processing, this framework relying on an anatomy-based structural network cannot account for the vulnerable locus for a specific task, lesioning of which would bring impairment. Here, we hypothesized that (i) activated PFC areas dynamically form an ordered network centered at a task-specific ""functional hub"" and (ii) the lesion-effective site corresponds to the ""functional hub,"" but not to a task-invariant ""structural hub."" To test these hypotheses, we conducted functional magnetic resonance imaging experiments in macaques performing a temporal contextual memory task. We found that the activated areas formed a hierarchical hub-centric network based on task-evoked directed connectivity, differently from the anatomical network reflecting axonal projection patterns. Using a novel simulated-lesion method based on support vector machine, we estimated severity of impairment after lesioning of each area, which accorded well with a known dissociation in contextual memory impairment in macaques (impairment after lesioning in area 9/46d, but not in area 8Ad). The predicted severity of impairment was proportional to the network ""hubness"" of the virtually lesioned area in the task-evoked directed connectivity network, rather than in the anatomical network known from tracer studies. Our results suggest that PFC areas dynamically and cooperatively shape a functional hub-centric network to reallocate the lesion-effective site depending on the cognitive processes, apart from static anatomical hubs. These findings will be a foundation for precise prediction of behavioral impacts of damage or surgical intervention in human brains.","[Osada, Takahiro; Adachi, Yusuke; Miyamoto, Kentaro; Setsuie, Rieko; Miyashita, Yasushi] Univ Tokyo, Sch Med, Dept Physiol, Bunkyo Ku, Tokyo 113, Japan; [Osada, Takahiro] Juntendo Univ, Sch Med, Dept Physiol, Bunkyo Ku, Tokyo 113, Japan; [Jimura, Koji] Tokyo Inst Technol, Precis & Intelligence Lab, Yokohama, Kanagawa 227, Japan; [Miyashita, Yasushi] JST, CREST, Kawaguchi, Saitama, Japan","Osada, T (reprint author), Univ Tokyo, Sch Med, Dept Physiol, Bunkyo Ku, Tokyo 113, Japan.",yasushi_miyashita@m.u-tokyo.ac.jp,"ADACHI, Yusuke/O-5316-2016; Miyashita, Yasushi/B-7171-2019","ADACHI, Yusuke/0000-0001-8697-994X; Miyashita, Yasushi/0000-0003-3496-8637; Miyamoto, Kentaro/0000-0003-1386-0045; Osada, Takahiro/0000-0002-3743-3200","KAKENHI from Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) [19002010, 24220008, 25750399]; CREST, Japan Science and Technology Agency; Japan Society for the Promotion of Science Research Fellowships for Young Scientists [234682, 265926]","This research was supported in part by KAKENHI Grants 19002010 and 24220008 from Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) (http://www.jsps.go.jp/english/index.html) to YM, 25750399 to YA, CREST, Japan Science and Technology Agency (http://www.jst.go.jp/kisoken/crest/en/index.html) to YM, and Japan Society for the Promotion of Science Research Fellowships for Young Scientists (http://www.jsps.go.jp/english/index.html) to KM (234682, 265926).

Most theories posit distinct roles for these structures, despite their similarities. We compared responses of VS neurons to those of ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) Area 14 neurons, recorded in a risky choice task. Five major response patterns observed in vmPFC were also observed in VS: (1) offer value encoding, (2) value difference encoding, (3) preferential encoding of chosen relative to unchosen value, (4) a correlation between residual variance in responses and choices, and (5) prominent encoding of outcomes. We did observe some differences as well; in particular, preferential encoding of the chosen option was stronger and started earlier in VS than in vmPFC. Nonetheless, the close match between vmPFC and VS suggests that cortex and its striatal targets make overlapping contributions to economic choice.","[Strait, Caleb E.; Sleezer, Brianna J.; Hayden, Benjamin Y.] Univ Rochester, Dept Brain & Cognit Sci, Rochester, NY 14627 USA; [Strait, Caleb E.; Sleezer, Brianna J.; Hayden, Benjamin Y.] Univ Rochester, Ctr Visual Sci, Rochester, NY 14627 USA; [Sleezer, Brianna J.] Univ Rochester, Neurosci Grad Program, Rochester, NY USA","Strait, CE (reprint author), Univ Rochester, Dept Brain & Cognit Sci, Rochester, NY 14627 USA.",caleb.strait@gmail.com,,"Strait, Caleb/0000-0001-6154-0578",National Institutes of Health [DA038106]; NARSAD Young Investigator Reward from the Brain and Behavior Research Foundation,"This research was supported by a National Institutes of Health http://grants.nih.gov/grants/oer.htm R01 (DA038106) and a NARSAD Young Investigator Reward from the Brain and Behavior Research Foundation http://bbrfoundation.org/ to BYH.

Yet, the extent to which motor skill acquisition relies on intrinsic spinal cord processes remains unknown. To date, attempts to address this question were limited by difficulties in separating spinal local effects from supraspinal influences through traditional electrophysiological and neuroimaging methods. Here, for the first time, we provide evidence for local learning-induced plasticity in intact human spinal cord through simultaneous functional magnetic resonance imaging of the brain and spinal cord during motor sequence learning. Specifically, we show learning-related modulation of activity in the C6-C8 spinal region, which is independent from that of related supraspinal sensorimotor structures. Moreover, a brain-spinal cord functional connectivity analysis demonstrates that the initial linear relationship between the spinal cord and sensorimotor cortex gradually fades away over the course of motor sequence learning, while the connectivity between spinal activity and cerebellum gains strength. These data suggest that the spinal cord not only constitutes an active functional component of the human motor learning network but also contributes distinctively from the brain to the learning process. The present findings open new avenues for rehabilitation of patients with spinal cord injuries, as they demonstrate that this part of the central nervous system is much more plastic than assumed before. Yet, the neurophysiological mechanisms underlying this intrinsic functional plasticity in the spinal cord warrant further investigations.","[Vahdat, Shahabeddin; Lungu, Ovidiu; Doyon, Julien] Univ Montreal, Funct Neuroimaging Unit, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Vahdat, Shahabeddin; Lungu, Ovidiu; Cohen-Adad, Julien; Benali, Habib; Doyon, Julien] SensoriMotor Rehabil Res Team CIHR, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Cohen-Adad, Julien] Ecole Polytech, Montreal, PQ H3C 3A7, Canada; [Marchand-Pauvert, Veronique; Benali, Habib] INSERM UPMC, Pitie Salpetriere Hosp, Paris, France","Vahdat, S (reprint author), Univ Montreal, Funct Neuroimaging Unit, Montreal, PQ, Canada.",julien.doyon@umontreal.ca,"Marchand-Pauvert, Veronique/E-5001-2017","Marchand-Pauvert, Veronique/0000-0002-0226-7169","Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada [RGPIN-2014-06318]; SensoriMotor Rehabilitation Research Team (SMRRT), Canadian Institutes of Health Research [RMF111622]","This work was funded by Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada, RGPIN-2014-06318, JD http://www.nserc-crsng.gc.ca/index_eng.asp; SensoriMotor Rehabilitation Research Team (SMRRT), Canadian Institutes of Health Research, RMF111622, JD http://www.cihr-irsc.gc.ca/e/193.html; and SensoriMotor Rehabilitation Research Team (SMRRT), Canadian Institutes of Health Research, postdoctoral fellowships, SV and OL; http://www.cihr-irsc.gc.ca/e/193.html.

Although animal vocalizations often comprise combinations of meaningless acoustic elements, evidence that rearranging such combinations generates functionally distinct meaning is lacking. Here, we provide evidence for this basic ability in calls of the chestnut-crowned babbler (Pomatostomus ruficeps), a highly cooperative bird of the Australian arid zone. Using acoustic analyses, natural observations, and a series of controlled playback experiments, we demonstrate that this species uses the same acoustic elements (A and B) in different arrangements (AB or BAB) to create two functionally distinct vocalizations. Specifically, the addition or omission of a contextually meaningless acoustic element at a single position generates a phoneme-like contrast that is sufficient to distinguish the meaning between the two calls. Our results indicate that the capacity to rearrange meaningless sounds in order to create new signals occurs outside of humans. We suggest that phonemic contrasts represent a rudimentary form of phoneme structure and a potential early step towards the generative phonemic system of human language.","[Engesser, Sabrina; Townsend, Simon W.] Univ Zurich, Inst Evolutionary Biol & Environm Studies, Zurich, Switzerland; [Crane, Jodie M.

Here, we describe a spatial and temporal organization of the songbird premotor cortical microcircuit that supports sparse sequences of neural activity. Multi-channel electrophysiology and calcium imaging reveal that neural activity in premotor cortex is correlated with a length scale of 100 mu m. Within this length scale, basal-ganglia-projecting excitatory neurons, on average, fire at a specific phase of a local 30 Hz network rhythm.

Yet, to date, the underlying genetic mechanisms and associated trait functions that are unique to rapid coevolutionary change are generally unknown. We here combined experimental evolution of the bacterial biocontrol agent Bacillus thuringiensis and its nematode host Caenorhabditis elegans with large-scale phenotyping, whole genome analysis, and functional genetics to demonstrate the selective benefit of pathogen virulence and the underlying toxin genes during the adaptation process. We show that: (i) high virulence was specifically favoured during pathogen-host coevolution rather than pathogen one-sided adaptation to a nonchanging host or to an environment without host; (ii) the pathogen genotype BT-679 with known nematocidal toxin genes and high virulence specifically swept to fixation in all of the independent replicate populations under coevolution but only some under one-sided adaptation; (iii) high virulence in the BT-679-dominated populations correlated with elevated copy numbers of the plasmid containing the nematocidal toxin genes; (iv) loss of virulence in a toxin-plasmid lacking BT-679 isolate was reconstituted by genetic reintroduction or external addition of the toxins. We conclude that sustained coevolution is distinct from unidirectional selection in shaping the pathogen's genome and life history characteristics. To our knowledge, this study is the first to characterize the pathogen genes involved in coevolutionary adaptation in an animal host-pathogen interaction system.","[Masri, Leila; Sheppard, Anna E.; Papkou, Andrei; Laehnemann, David; Prahl, Swantje; Saebelfeld, Manja; Schulenburg, Hinrich] Univ Kiel, Inst Zool, Dept Evolutionary Ecol & Genet, D-24098 Kiel, Germany; [Masri, Leila; Laehnemann, David; Guenther, Patrick S.; Michiels, Nicolaas K.; Schulenburg, Hinrich] Univ Tubingen, Inst Evolut & Ecol, Dept Anim Evolutionary Ecol, Tubingen, Germany; [Branca, Antoine; Kurtz, Joachim; Telschow, Arndt; Bornberg-Bauer, Erich] Univ Munster, Inst Evolut & Biodivers, D-48149 Munster, Germany; [Hollensteiner, Jacqueline; Liesegang, Heiko; Brzuszkiewicz, Elzbieta; Daniel, Rolf] Univ Gottingen, Inst Microbiol & Genet, Goettingen Genom Lab, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany; [Schulte, Rebecca D.] Univ Osnabruck, Dept Behav Biol, Osnabruck, Germany; [Rosenstiel, Philip] Univ Kiel, Inst Clin Mol Biol, Kiel, Germany","Masri, L (reprint author), IST Austria, Klosterneuburg, Austria.",hschulenburg@zoologie.uni-kiel.de,"Michiels, Nico/A-2045-2009; Branca, Antoine/H-6088-2012; Bornberg-Bauer, Erich/A-1563-2013; Kurtz, Joachim/A-9678-2008; Schulenburg, Hinrich/A-3886-2009; Lahnemann, David/K-7208-2019; Rosenstiel, Philip/A-5137-2009","Bornberg-Bauer, Erich/0000-0002-1826-3576; Kurtz, Joachim/0000-0002-7258-459X; Lahnemann, David/0000-0002-9138-4112; Rosenstiel, Philip/0000-0002-9692-8828; Daniel, Rolf/0000-0002-8646-7925; Sheppard, Anna/0000-0002-2913-0920; Liesegang, Heiko/0000-0003-1792-2047","German Science Foundation (DFG) [SCHU 1415/8, SCHU 1415/9, RO 2994/3, BO 2544/7, LI 1690/2, TE 976/2, SCHU 2522/1, KU 1929/4]; Kiel Excellence Cluster Inflammation at Interfaces; ISTFELLOW program (Co-fund Marie Curie Actions of the European Commission)","We are very grateful for funding from the German Science Foundation (DFG) to HS (SCHU 1415/8, SCHU 1415/9), PR (RO 2994/3), EBB (BO 2544/7), HL (LI 1690/2), AT (TE 976/2), RDS (SCHU 2522/1), JK (KU 1929/4); from the Kiel Excellence Cluster Inflammation at Interfaces to HS and PR; and from the ISTFELLOW program (Co-fund Marie Curie Actions of the European Commission) to LM.

To date, however, the molecular signals controlling synaptic dynamics have been poorly understood. Membrane-derived bioactive phospholipids are potential candidates to control short-term tuning of synaptic signaling, a plastic event essential for information processing at both the cellular and neuronal network levels in the brain. Here, we showed that phospholipids affect excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmission by different degrees, loci, and mechanisms of action. Signaling triggered by lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) evoked rapid and reversible depression of excitatory and inhibitory postsynaptic currents. At excitatory synapses, LPA-induced depression depended on LPA(1)/G(alpha i/o)-protein/phospholipase C/myosin light chain kinase cascade at the presynaptic site. LPA increased myosin light chain phosphorylation, which is known to trigger actomyosin contraction, and reduced the number of synaptic vesicles docked to active zones in excitatory boutons. At inhibitory synapses, postsynaptic LPA signaling led to dephosphorylation, and internalization of the GABA(A gamma 2) subunit through the LPA(1)/G(alpha 12/13)-protein/RhoA/Rho kinase/calcineurin pathway. However, LPA-induced depression of GABAergic transmission was correlated with an endocytosis-independent reduction of GABA(A) receptors, possibly by GABA(A gamma 2) dephosphorylation and subsequent increased lateral diffusion. Furthermore, endogenous LPA signaling, mainly via LPA(1), mediated activity-dependent inhibitory depression in a model of experimental synaptic plasticity. Finally, LPA signaling, most likely restraining the excitatory drive incoming to motoneurons, regulated performance of motor output commands, a basic brain processing task. We propose that lysophospholipids serve as potential local messengers that tune synaptic strength to precedent activity of the neuron.","[Garcia-Morales, Victoria; Montero, Fernando; Gonzalez-Forero, David; Rodriguez-Bey, Guillermo; Gomez-Perez, Laura; Jesus Medialdea-Wandossell, Maria; Dominguez-Vias, German; Moreno-Lopez, Bernardo] Univ Cadiz, Fac Med, Area Fisiol, Grp Neurodegenerac & Neuroreparac GRUNEDERE, Cadiz, Spain; [Jesus Medialdea-Wandossell, Maria] Univ Cadiz, Salus Infirmorum, Cadiz, Spain; [Manuel Garcia-Verdugo, Jose] Univ Valencia, CIBERNED, Ctr Invest Principe Felipe, Valencia, Spain","Garcia-Morales, V (reprint author), Univ Cadiz, Fac Med, Area Fisiol, Grp Neurodegenerac & Neuroreparac GRUNEDERE, Cadiz, Spain.",bernardo.moreno@uca.es,"Garcia-Verdugo, Jose Manuel/L-8421-2017; DOMINGUEZ-VIAS, GERMAN/J-8266-2015; Moreno-Lopez, Bernardo/S-5148-2019","Garcia-Verdugo, Jose Manuel/0000-0001-9872-6499; DOMINGUEZ-VIAS, GERMAN/0000-0002-9546-9148; Moreno-Lopez, Bernardo/0000-0003-2897-6227; Garcia-Morales, Victoria/0000-0002-8964-9935","Spain's Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad [SAF2011-23633]; Junta de Andalucia's Consejeria de Innovacion, Ciencia y Empresa [PAI2011-CTS-7281]","This work was supported by grants from Spain's Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad (SAF2011-23633) and the Junta de Andalucia's Consejeria de Innovacion, Ciencia y Empresa (PAI2011-CTS-7281) to BML.

Establishment of a fully functional vasculature is complex and requires a number of steps including vasculogenesis and angiogenesis that are followed by differentiation into specialized vascular tissues (i.e., arteries, veins, and lymphatics) and organ-specific differentiation. However, an equally essential step in this process is the pruning of excessive blood vessels. Recent studies have shown that pruning is critical for the effective perfusion of blood into tissues. Despite its significance, vessel pruning is the least understood process in vascular differentiation and development.

In this study, we have combined a detailed analysis of aneuploid clones isolated from laboratory-evolved populations of Saccharomyces cerevisiae with a systematic, genome-wide screen for the fitness effects of telomeric amplifications to address the relationship between aneuploidy and cellular fitness. We found that aneuploid clones rise to high population frequencies in nutrient-limited evolution experiments and show increased fitness relative to wild type. Direct competition experiments confirmed that three out of four aneuploid events isolated from evolved populations were themselves sufficient to improve fitness. To expand the scope beyond this small number of exemplars, we created a genome-wide collection of >1,800 diploid yeast strains, each containing a different telomeric amplicon (Tamp), ranging in size from 0.4 to 1,000 kb. Using pooled competition experiments in nutrient-limited chemostats followed by high-throughput sequencing of strain-identifying barcodes, we determined the fitness effects of these >1,800 Tamps under three different conditions. Our data revealed that the fitness landscape explored by telomeric amplifications is much broader than that explored by single-gene amplifications. As also observed in the evolved clones, we found the fitness effects of most Tamps to be condition specific, with a minority showing common effects in all three conditions. By integrating our data with previous work that examined the fitness effects of single-gene amplifications genome-wide, we found that a small number of genes within each Tamp are centrally responsible for each Tamp's fitness effects. Our genome-wide Tamp screen confirmed that telomeric amplifications identified in laboratory-evolved populations generally increased fitness. Our results show that Tamps are mutations that produce large, typically condition-dependent changes in fitness that are important drivers of increased fitness in asexually evolving populations.","[Sunshine, Anna B.; Payen, Celia; Ong, Giang T.; Liachko, Ivan; Dunham, Maitreya J.] Univ Washington, Dept Genome Sci, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Tan, Kean Ming] Univ Washington, Dept Biostat, Seattle, WA 98195 USA","Sunshine, AB (reprint author), Univ Washington, Dept Genome Sci, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.",maitreya@uw.edu,,"Dunham, Maitreya/0000-0001-9944-2666",National Institute of General Medical Sciences from the National Institutes of Health [R01 GM094306]; National Science Foundation [1120425]; Royalty Research Fund; March of Dimes; Marian E.

In mammals, these rhythms are coordinated by a small set of neurons, located in the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN). The environmental light/dark cycle synchronizes (entrains) the SCN via a distinct pathway, originating in a subset of photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (pRGCs) that utilize the photopigment melanopsin (OPN4). The pRGCs are also innervated by rods and cones and, so, are both endogenously and exogenously light sensitive. Accumulating evidence has shown that the circadian system is sensitive to ultraviolet (UV), blue, and green wavelengths of light. However, it was unclear whether colour perception itself can help entrain the SCN. By utilizing both behavioural and electrophysiological recording techniques, Walmsley and colleagues show that multiple photic channels interact and enhance the capacity of the SCN to synchronize to the environmental cycle. Thus, entrainment of the circadian system combines both environmental irradiance and colour information to ensure that internal and external time are appropriately aligned.","[van Diepen, Hester C.; Meijer, Johanna H.] Leiden Univ, Sch Med, Dept Mol Cell Biol, Neurophysiol Lab, Leiden, Netherlands; [van Diepen, Hester C.; Foster, Russell G.] Univ Oxford, John Radcliffe Hosp, Nuffield Lab Ophthalmol, Sleep & Circadian Neurosci Inst SCNi,Nuffield Dep, Oxford OX3 9DU, England","van Diepen, HC (reprint author), Leiden Univ, Sch Med, Dept Mol Cell Biol, Neurophysiol Lab, Leiden, Netherlands.",j.h.meijer@LUMC.nl,,,,,,17,6,6,0,19,PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE,SAN FRANCISCO,"1160 BATTERY STREET, STE 100, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94111 USA",1545-7885,,,PLOS BIOL,PLoS.

Despite photoreceptor loss, the inner retina and central visual pathways remain intact over an extended time period, which has led to creative optogenetic approaches to restore light sensitivity in the surviving inner retina. The major drawbacks of all optogenetic tools recently developed and tested in mouse models are their low light sensitivity and lack of physiological compatibility. Here we introduce a next-generation optogenetic tool, Opto-mGluR6, designed for retinal ON-bipolar cells, which overcomes these limitations. We show that Opto-mGluR6, a chimeric protein consisting of the intracellular domains of the ON-bipolar cell-specific metabotropic glutamate receptor mGluR6 and the light-sensing domains of melanopsin, reliably recovers vision at the retinal, cortical, and behavioral levels under moderate daylight illumination.","[van Wyk, Michiel; Kleinlogel, Sonja] Univ Bern, Inst Physiol, Bern, Switzerland; [van Wyk, Michiel] Univ Bern, Inst Anim Pathol, Vetsuisse Fac, Bern, Switzerland; [Pielecka-Fortuna, Justyna; Loewel, Siegrid] Univ Gottingen, Bernstein Fokus Neurotechnol & Johann Friedrich B, Syst Neurosci, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany; [Loewel, Siegrid] Univ Gottingen, Sensory Collaborat Res Ctr 889, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany","van Wyk, M (reprint author), Univ Bern, Inst Physiol, Bern, Switzerland.",kleinlogel@pyl.unibe.ch,"889, CRC/L-1607-2018","889, CRC/0000-0002-6678-3138; van Wyk, Michiel/0000-0003-3055-9721","Haag-Streit Holding AG (HSH); Swiss National Science Foundation [31003A_152807/1]; Commission for Technology and Innovation of Switzerland [14341.1 PFLS-LS]; Federal Ministry of Education and Research of Germany [01GQ0921, 01GQ0810]; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft through the Collaborative Research Center [889]; Alexander von Humboldt Research Fellowship for Postdoctoral Researchers","This work was supported by sponsorship from the Haag-Streit Holding AG (HSH: http://www.haag-streit.com) and grants from the Swiss National Science Foundation (www.snf.ch, 31003A_152807/1), the Commission for Technology and Innovation of Switzerland (www.kti.admin.ch, 14341.1 PFLS-LS), the Federal Ministry of Education and Research of Germany (www.bmbf.de, 01GQ0921 and 01GQ0810), the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (www.dfg.de) through the Collaborative Research Center 889 to SL (Project B5) and an Alexander von Humboldt Research Fellowship for Postdoctoral Researchers to JPF.

During this process, polarity complexes are targeted to the apical surface by a RAB11A-dependent mechanism. Huntingtin (HTT), the protein that is mutated in Huntington disease, acts as a scaffold for molecular motors and promotes microtubule-based dynamics. Here, we investigated the role of HTT in apical polarity during the morphogenesis of the mouse mammary epithelium. We found that the depletion of HTT from luminal cells in vivo alters mouse ductal morphogenesis and lumen formation. HTT is required for the apical localization of PAR3-aPKC during epithelial morphogenesis in virgin, pregnant, and lactating mice. We show that HTT forms a complex with PAR3, aPKC, and RAB11A and ensures the microtubule-dependent apical vesicular translocation of PAR3-aPKC through RAB11A. We thus propose that HTT regulates polarized vesicular transport, lumen formation and mammary epithelial morphogenesis.","[Elias, Salah; McGuire, John Russel; Yu, Hua; Humbert, Sandrine] Inst Curie, F-91405 Orsay, France; [Elias, Salah; McGuire, John Russel; Yu, Hua; Humbert, Sandrine] CNRS, UMR 3306, F-91405 Orsay, France; [Elias, Salah; McGuire, John Russel; Yu, Hua; Humbert, Sandrine] Univ Paris 11, INSERM, U1005, F-91405 Orsay, France; [Humbert, Sandrine] Univ Grenoble Alpes, Grenoble Inst Neurosci, Grenoble, France; [Humbert, Sandrine] INSERM, U836, Grenoble, France","Elias, S (reprint author), Inst Curie, F-91405 Orsay, France.",sandrine.humbert@ujf-grenoble.fr,"Humbert, Sandrine/S-2981-2016",,Agence Nationale pour la Recherche - Maladies Rares [ANR-09-BLAN-0080]; Association pour la Recherche sur le Cancer (ARC) [3188]; Fondation pour la Recherche Medicale (FRM); Canceropole Ile de France [2013-1-PL BIO-02-ICR-1]; CNRS; INSERM; Institut Curie,"Agence Nationale pour la Recherche - Maladies Rares (ANR-09-BLAN-0080, S.H). http://www.agence-nationale-recherche.fr.

These enzymes have a fundamentally similar structure, but achieve functional diversity through variable regions that determine how the catalytic core is activated and recruited to phosphorylation targets. ""Hippo"" pathways are ancient protein kinase signaling systems that control cell proliferation and morphogenesis; the NDR/LATS family protein kinases, which associate with ""Mob"" coactivator proteins, are central but incompletely understood components of these pathways. Here we describe the crystal structure of budding yeast Cbk1-Mob2, to our knowledge the first of an NDR/LATS kinase-Mob complex. It shows a novel coactivator-organized activation region that may be unique to NDR/LATS kinases, in which a key regulatory motif apparently shifts from an inactive binding mode to an active one upon phosphorylation. We also provide a structural basis for a substrate docking mechanism previously unknown in AGC family kinases, and show that docking interaction provides robustness to Cbk1's regulation of its two known in vivo substrates. Co-evolution of docking motifs and phosphorylation consensus sites strongly indicates that a protein is an in vivo regulatory target of this hippo pathway, and predicts a new group of high-confidence Cbk1 substrates that function at sites of cytokinesis and cell growth. Moreover, docking peptides arise in unstructured regions of proteins that are probably already kinase substrates, suggesting a broad sequential model for adaptive acquisition of kinase docking in rapidly evolving intrinsically disordered polypeptides.","[Gogl, Gergo; Remenyi, Attila] Hungarian Acad Sci, Res Ctr Nat Sci, Inst Enzymol, Lendulet Prot Interact Grp, Budapest, Hungary; [Gogl, Gergo] Eotvos Lorand Univ, Dept Biochem, Budapest, Hungary; [Schneider, Kyle D.; Yeh, Brian J.; Alam, Nashida; Weiss, Eric L.] Northwestern Univ, Dept Mol Biosci, Evanston, IL USA; [Ba, Alex N.

These polymorphic cell-surface glycoproteins bind peptide antigens, forming ligands for cytotoxic T and natural killer cell receptors. Under pressure from rapidly evolving viruses, hominoid MHC class I molecules also evolve rapidly, becoming diverse and species-specific. Little is known of the impact of infectious disease epidemics on MHC class I variant distributions in human populations, a context in which the chimpanzee is the superior animal model. Population dynamics of the chimpanzees inhabiting Gombe National Park, Tanzania have been studied for over 50 years. This population is infected with SIVcpz, the precursor of human HIV-1. Because HLA-B is the most polymorphic human MHC class I molecule and correlates strongly with HIV-1 progression, we determined sequences for its ortholog, Patr-B, in 125 Gombe chimpanzees. Eleven Patr-B variants were defined, as were their frequencies in Gombe's three communities, changes in frequency with time, and effect of SIVcpz infection. The growing populations of the northern and central communities, where SIVcpz is less prevalent, have stable distributions comprising a majority of low-frequency Patr-B variants and a few high-frequency variants. Driving the latter to high frequency has been the fecundity of immigrants to the northern community, whereas in the central community, it has been the fecundity of socially dominant individuals. In the declining population of the southern community, where greater SIVcpz prevalence is associated with mortality and emigration, Patr-B variant distributions have been changing. Enriched in this community are Patr-B variants that engage with natural killer cell receptors. Elevated among SIVcpz-infected chimpanzees, the Patr-B*06:03 variant has striking structural and functional similarities to HLA-B*57, the human allotype most strongly associated with delayed HIV-1 progression. Like HLA-B*57, Patr-B*06:03 correlates with reduced viral load, as assessed by detection of SIVcpz RNA in feces.","[Wroblewski, Emily E.; Norman, Paul J.; Guethlein, Lisbeth A.; Parham, Peter] Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Dept Biol Struct, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Wroblewski, Emily E.; Norman, Paul J.; Guethlein, Lisbeth A.; Parham, Peter] Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Dept Microbiol & Immunol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Rudicell, Rebecca S.] NIH, Vaccine Res Ctr, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; [Rudicell, Rebecca S.] Sanofi, Cambridge, MA USA; [Ramirez, Miguel A.; Li, Yingying; Hahn, Beatrice H.] Univ Penn, Perelman Sch Med, Dept Med, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Ramirez, Miguel A.; Li, Yingying; Hahn, Beatrice H.] Univ Penn, Perelman Sch Med, Dept Microbiol, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Pusey, Anne E.] Duke Univ, Dept Evolutionary Anthropol, Durham, NC USA","Wroblewski, EE (reprint author), Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Dept Biol Struct, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",eewro1@stanford.edu; peropa@stanford.edu,,"Norman, Paul/0000-0001-8370-7703; Hahn, Beatrice/0000-0002-9400-9887","National Institutes of Health [R01 AI 24258, R01 AI 31168, R01 AI 058715]; NIH/NIAID, Ruth L.

Here, we show that EGFRvIII induces the expression and secretion of pigment epithelium-derived factor (PEDF) via activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), thereby promoting self-renewal and tumor progression of glioma stem cells (GSCs). Mechanistically, PEDF sustained GSC self-renewal by Notch1 cleavage, and the generated intracellular domain of Notch1 (NICD) induced the expression of Sox2 through interaction with its promoter region. Furthermore, a subpopulation with high levels of PEDF was capable of infiltration along corpus callosum. Inhibition of PEDF diminished GSC self-renewal and increased survival of orthotopic tumor-bearing mice. Together, these data indicate the novel role of PEDF as a key regulator of GSC and suggest clinical implications.","[Yin, Jinlong; Park, Gunwoo; Yun, Hyeongsun; Lee, Jeong Eun; Kim, Minkyung; Yoo, Heon; Kim, Jong Heon; Lee, Seung-Hoon; Park, Jong Bae] Natl Canc Ctr, Grad Sch Canc Sci & Policy, Dept Syst Canc Sci, Goyang, South Korea; [Yin, Jinlong; Park, Gunwoo; Kim, Tae Hoon; Hong, Jun Hee; Kim, Youn-Jae; Kang, Sangjo; Jung, Ji-Eun; Yun, Hyeongsun; Gwak, Ho-Shin; Yoo, Heon; Lee, Seung-Hoon; Park, Jong Bae] Natl Canc Ctr, Res Inst & Hosp, Specif Organs Canc Branch, Goyang, South Korea; [Jin, Xiong; Jung, Ji-Eun; Kim, Hyunggee] Korea Univ, Sch Life Sci & Biotechnol, Dept Biotechnol, Seoul, South Korea; [Kim, Jeong-Yub; Park, Myung-Jin] Korea Inst Radiol & Med Sci, Res Ctr Radiosenescence, Div Radiat Canc Res, Seoul, South Korea; [Kim, Jeong-Yub] Korea Univ, Coll Med, Dept Pathol, Seoul 136705, South Korea; [Chung, Junho] Seoul Natl Univ, Coll Med, Dept Biochem & Mol Biol, Seoul, South Korea; [Chung, Junho] Seoul Natl Univ, Coll Med, Dept Canc Biol, Seoul, South Korea; [Nakano, Ichiro] Ohio State Univ, Dept Neurol Surg, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [Nakano, Ichiro] Ohio State Univ, James Comprehens Canc Ctr, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [Yoo, Byong Chul] Natl Canc Ctr, Res Inst & Hosp, Colorectal Canc Branch, Goyangi, South Korea; [Lee, Jeong Eun; Kim, Jong Heon] Natl Canc Ctr, Res Inst & Hosp, Canc Cell & Mol Biol Branch, Goyang, South Korea; [Hur, Eun-Mi] Korea Inst Sci & Technol, Brain Sci Inst, Ctr Neurosci, Seoul, South Korea; [Hur, Eun-Mi] Korea Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Neurosci, Taejon, South Korea; [Lee, Jeongwu] Cleveland Clin, Lerner Res Inst, Dept Stem Cell Biol & Regenerat Med, Cleveland, OH 44106 USA","Yin, J (reprint author), Natl Canc Ctr, Grad Sch Canc Sci & Policy, Dept Syst Canc Sci, Goyang, South Korea.",nslsh@ncc.re.kr; mjpark@kcch.re.kr; jbp@ncc.re.kr,"Kim, Hyunggee/F-2673-2013; Jin, Xiong/I-7609-2015","Kim, Hyunggee/0000-0002-4738-0990; Jin, Xiong/0000-0001-9252-1441","National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Ministry of Education [NRF-2013R1A1A2062555]; National Cancer Center, Republic of Korea [1210043, 1210042, 1210041, 1510060-1]; Nuclear Research & Development Program - Korean Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning","This research was supported by Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) funded by the Ministry of Education (NRF-2013R1A1A2062555, JBP) and grant funded by the National Cancer Center, Republic of Korea (1210043, HYo; 1210042, SHL; 1210041, JBP, and 1510060-1, JBP) and grant funded by Nuclear Research & Development Program funded by the Korean Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning (MJP).

We employ the natural infection of Drosophila with a parasitoid wasp to study energy regulation during immune response. To combat the invasion, the host must produce specialized immune cells (lamellocytes) that destroy the parasitoid egg. We show that a significant portion of nutrients are allocated to differentiating lamellocytes when they would otherwise be used for development. This systemic metabolic switch is mediated by extracellular adenosine released from immune cells. The switch is crucial for an effective immune response. Preventing adenosine transport from immune cells or blocking adenosine receptor precludes the metabolic switch and the deceleration of development, dramatically reducing host resistance. Adenosine thus serves as a signal that the ""selfish"" immune cells send during infection to secure more energy at the expense of other tissues.","[Bajgar, Adam; Kucerova, Katerina; Jonatova, Lucie; Schneedorferova, Ivana; Okrouhlik, Jan; Dolezal, Tomas] Univ South Bohemia Ceske Budejovice, Fac Sci, Ceske Budejovice, Czech Republic; [Tomcala, Ales; Schneedorferova, Ivana] Acad Sci Czech Republic, Inst Parasitol, Ctr Biol, CR-37005 Ceske Budejovice, Czech Republic","Bajgar, A (reprint author), Univ South Bohemia Ceske Budejovice, Fac Sci, Ceske Budejovice, Czech Republic.",tomas.dolezal@prf.jcu.cz,"Tomcala, Ales/G-5717-2014; Bajgar, Adam/O-4354-2017","Tomcala, Ales/0000-0002-5232-8441; Dolezal, Tomas/0000-0001-5217-4465",Grant Agency of the Czech Republic [P305-12-0115]; Marie Curie International Outgoing Fellowship within the EU Seventh Framework Programme for Research and Technological Development [298186],"This work was supported by the Grant Agency of the Czech Republic (Project P305-12-0115; www.gacr.cz) and Marie Curie International Outgoing Fellowship within the EU Seventh Framework Programme for Research and Technological Development 2007-2013 (Project 298186; http://ec.europa.eu/research/mariecurieactions/).

Instances of convergent evolution of locomotory patterns that quantitatively agree with the mechanically optimal solution are very rare. Here, we show that, with respect to a very diverse group of aquatic animals, a mechanically optimal method of swimming with elongated fins has evolved independently at least eight times in both vertebrate and invertebrate swimmers across three different phyla. Specifically, if we take the length of an undulation along an animal's fin during swimming and divide it by the mean amplitude of undulations along the fin length, the result is consistently around twenty. We call this value the optimal specific wavelength (OSW). We show that the OSW maximizes the force generated by the body, which also maximizes swimming speed. We hypothesize a mechanical basis for this optimality and suggest reasons for its repeated emergence through evolution.","[Bale, Rahul; Bhalla, Amneet Pal Singh; MacIver, Malcolm A.; Patankar, Neelesh A.] Northwestern Univ, Dept Mech Engn, Evanston, IL 60208 USA; [Neveln, Izaak D.; MacIver, Malcolm A.] Northwestern Univ, Dept Biomed Engn, Evanston, IL 60208 USA; [MacIver, Malcolm A.] Northwestern Univ, Dept Neurobiol, Evanston, IL USA","Bale, R (reprint author), Northwestern Univ, Dept Mech Engn, Evanston, IL 60208 USA.",maciver@northwestern.edu; n-patankar@northwestern.edu,"Patankar, Neelesh/B-7603-2009; MacIver, Malcolm/E-3005-2013; Bale, Rahul/D-2469-2016","MacIver, Malcolm/0000-0002-3711-8235; Bale, Rahul/0000-0003-4586-2782","National Science Foundation [CBET-0828749, CMMI-0941674, PECASE IOB-0846032, CBET-1066575, CTS-070056T, CTS-090006]; Northwestern University High Performance Computing System-Quest","This work was supported by the National Science Foundation (www.nsf.gov) grants CBET-0828749 to NAP and MAM, CMMI-0941674 to MAM and NAP, PECASE IOB-0846032 to MAM, and CBET-1066575 to NAP.

Spontaneous polarization is thought to require dynamic Cdc42 recycling through Guanine nucleotide Dissociation Inhibitor (GDI)-mediated membrane extraction and vesicle trafficking. Here, we describe a functional fluorescent Cdc42 allele in fission yeast, which demonstrates Cdc42 dynamics and polarization independent of these pathways. Furthermore, an engineered Cdc42 allele targeted to the membrane independently of these recycling pathways by an amphipathic helix is viable and polarizes spontaneously to multiple sites in fission and budding yeasts. We show that Cdc42 is highly mobile at the membrane and accumulates at sites of activity, where it displays slower mobility. By contrast, a near-immobile transmembrane domain-containing Cdc42 allele supports viability and polarized activity, but does not accumulate at sites of activity.

It is crucial for the formation of central spindle microtubule bundle structure. Its accumulation at the central antiparallel overlap zone is key for recruitment and regulation of downstream cytokinesis factors and for stable anchoring of the plasma membrane at the midbody. Both MKLP1 and CYK4 are required for efficient microtubule bundling. However, the mechanism by which CYK4 contributes to this is unclear. Here we performed structural and functional analyses of centralspindlin using high-speed atomic force microscopy, Forster resonance energy transfer analysis, and in vitro reconstitution. Our data reveal that CYK4 binds to a globular mass in the atypically long MKLP1 neck domain between the catalytic core and the coiled coil and thereby reconfigures the two motor domains in the MKLP1 dimer to be suitable for antiparallel microtubule bundling. Our work provides insights into the microtubule bundling during cytokinesis and into the working mechanisms of the kinesins with non-canonical neck structures.","[Davies, Tim] Univ Cambridge, Gurdon Inst, Cambridge, England; [Kodera, Noriyuki; Ando, Toshio] Kanazawa Univ, Dept Phys, Kanazawa, Ishikawa 920, Japan; [Kodera, Noriyuki; Ando, Toshio] Kanazawa Univ, BioAFM Frontier Res Ctr, Kanazawa, Ishikawa, Japan; [Schierle, Gabriele S.

Seeking to optimise the simultaneous use of two antibiotics, we use the minimal dose at which clearance is observed in an in vitro experimental model of antibiotic treatment as a criterion to distinguish the best and worst treatments of a bacterium, Escherichia coli. Our aim is to compare a combination treatment consisting of two synergistic antibiotics to so-called sequential treatments in which the choice of antibiotic to administer can change with each round of treatment. Using mathematical predictions validated by the E. coli treatment model, we show that clearance of the bacterium can be achieved using sequential treatments at antibiotic dosages so low that the equivalent two-drug combination treatments are ineffective. Seeking to treat the bacterium in testing circumstances, we purposefully study an E. coli strain that has a multidrug pump encoded in its chromosome that effluxes both antibiotics. Genomic amplifications that increase the number of pumps expressed per cell can cause the failure of high-dose combination treatments, yet, as we show, sequentially treated populations can still collapse. However, dual resistance due to the pump means that the antibiotics must be carefully deployed and not all sublethal sequential treatments succeed. A screen of 136 96-h-long sequential treatments determined five of these that could clear the bacterium at sublethal dosages in all replicate populations, even though none had done so by 24 h. These successes can be attributed to a collateral sensitivity whereby cross-resistance due to the duplicated pump proves insufficient to stop a reduction in E. coli growth rate following drug exchanges, a reduction that proves large enough for appropriately chosen drug switches to clear the bacterium.","[Fuentes-Hernandez, Ayari; Pena-Miller, Rafael] Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Ctr Ciencias Genom, Cuernavaca 62191, Morelos, Mexico; [Plucain, Jessica; Gori, Fabio; Reding, Carlos; Gudelj, Ivana; Beardmore, Robert] Univ Exeter, Biosci, Exeter, Devon, England; [Jansen, Gunther; Schulenburg, Hinrich] Univ Kiel, Evolutionary Ecol & Genet, Kiel, Germany","Fuentes-Hernandez, A (reprint author), Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Ctr Ciencias Genom, Cuernavaca 62191, Morelos, Mexico.",r.e.beardmore@exeter.ac.uk,"Schulenburg, Hinrich/A-3886-2009","Reding, Carlos/0000-0002-6999-4029","UK Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council [EP/I00503X/1, EP/I018263/1]; Natural Environment Research Council [NE/E013007/3]","RB was funded by grants EP/I00503X/1 and EP/I018263/1 from the UK Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council.

Although synaptic feedback regulation of photoreceptors is known to occur in Drosophila, many questions about the underlying molecular mechanisms and physiological implementation remain unclear. Here, we systematically investigated these questions using a broad range of experimental methods. We isolated two I-h mutant fly lines that exhibit rhythmic photoreceptor depolarization without light stimulation. We discovered that I-h channels regulate glutamate release from amacrine cells by modulating calcium channel activity. Moreover, we showed that the eye-enriched kainate receptor (EKAR) is expressed in photoreceptors and receives the glutamate signal released from amacrine cells. Finally, we presented evidence that amacrine cell feedback regulation helps maintain light sensitivity in ambient light. Our findings suggest plausible molecular underpinnings and physiological effects of feedback regulation from amacrine cells to photoreceptors. These results provide new mechanistic insight into how synaptic feedback regulation can participate in network processing by modulating neural information transfer and circuit excitability.","[Hu, Wen; Wang, Tingting; Wang, Xiao; Han, Junhai] Southeast Univ, Inst Life Sci, Key Lab Dev Genes & Human Dis, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Hu, Wen; Wang, Tingting; Han, Junhai] Nantong Univ, Coinnovat Ctr Neuroregenerat, Nantong, Peoples R China","Han, JH (reprint author), Southeast Univ, Inst Life Sci, Key Lab Dev Genes & Human Dis, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",junhaihan@seu.edu.cn,,,"Ministry of Science and Technology [2014CB942803, 2012CB517903]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [91132706]; Excellent Youth Foundation of Jiangsu province of China [BK20140024]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities","This work was supported by a Ministry of Science and Technology Grant (2014CB942803 and 2012CB517903) and the National Natural Science Foundation of China (91132706), and Excellent Youth Foundation of Jiangsu province of China (BK20140024) to JH, the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities to WH.

Using confocal live imaging, we directly observed the cellular processes underlying tissue fusion, using the secondary palatal shelves as a model. We find that convergence of a multi-layered epithelium into a single-layer epithelium is an essential early step, driven by cell intercalation, and is concurrent to orthogonal cell displacement and epithelial cell extrusion. Functional studies in mice indicate that this process requires an actomyosin contractility pathway involving Rho kinase (ROCK) and myosin light chain kinase (MLCK), culminating in the activation of non-muscle myosin IIA (NMIIA). Together, these data indicate that actomyosin contractility drives cell intercalation and cell extrusion during palate fusion and suggest a general mechanism for tissue fusion in development.","[Kim, Seungil; Lewis, Ace E.; Singh, Vivek; Bush, Jeffrey O.] Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Cell & Tissue Biol, Program Craniofacial Biol, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; [Kim, Seungil; Lewis, Ace E.; Singh, Vivek; Bush, Jeffrey O.] Univ Calif San Francisco, Inst Human Genet, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; [Ma, Xuefei; Adelstein, Robert] NHLBI, Mol Cardiol Lab, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA","Kim, S (reprint author), Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Cell & Tissue Biol, Program Craniofacial Biol, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA.",Jeffrey.bush@ucsf.edu,,"Adelstein, Robert/0000-0002-8683-2144","National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research [R03DE22818, R01DE023337, R00DE020855]","This work was supported by grants R03DE22818, R01DE023337 and R00DE020855 from the National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research (http://www.nidcr.nih.gov/) to JOB.

Immune defense provides a classic example in which immune responses are presumed to be costly and therefore come at the expense of other traits related to fitness. One strategy for mitigating the costs of expensive traits is to render them inducible, such that the cost is paid only when the trait is utilized. In the current issue of PLOS Biology, Bajgar and colleagues elegantly demonstrate the energetic and life history cost of the immune response that Drosophila melanogaster larvae induce after infection by the parasitoid wasp Leptopilina boulardi. These authors show that infection-induced proliferation of defensive blood cells commands a diversion of dietary carbon away from somatic growth and development, with simple sugars instead being shunted to the hematopoetic organ for rapid conversion into the raw energy required for cell proliferation. This metabolic shift results in a 15% delay in the development of the infected larva and is mediated by adenosine signaling between the hematopoietic organ and the central metabolic control organ of the host fly. The adenosine signal thus allows D. melanogaster to rapidly marshal the energy needed for effective defense and to pay the cost of immunity only when infected.","Cornell Univ, Dept Entomol, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA","Lazzaro, BP (reprint author), Cornell Univ, Dept Entomol, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA.",bplazzaro@cornell.edu,,,"NIAID NIH HHS [R01AI083932, R01 AI083932]",,,22,1,1,0,11,PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE,SAN FRANCISCO,"1160 BATTERY STREET, STE 100, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94111 USA",1544-9173,1545-7885,,PLOS BIOL,PLoS.

Very little is known about how the brain transitions between these two fundamentally different forms of learning. Here we test a computational hypothesis that uncertainty about the causal relationship between a stimulus and an outcome induces rapid changes in the rate of learning, which in turn mediates the transition between incremental and one-shot learning. By using a novel behavioral task in combination with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data from human volunteers, we found evidence implicating the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex and hippocampus in this process. The hippocampus was selectively ""switched"" on when one-shot learning was predicted to occur, while the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex was found to encode uncertainty about the causal association, exhibiting increased coupling with the hippocampus for high-learning rates, suggesting this region may act as a ""switch,"" turning on and off one-shot learning as required.","[Lee, Sang Wan; O'Doherty, John P.; Shimojo, Shinsuke] CALTECH, Computat & Neural Syst, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA; [Lee, Sang Wan; O'Doherty, John P.; Shimojo, Shinsuke] CALTECH, Behav & Social Neurosci, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA; [Lee, Sang Wan; O'Doherty, John P.] CALTECH, Div Humanities & Social Sci, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA; [Shimojo, Shinsuke] CALTECH, Div Biol & Biol Engn, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA","Lee, SW (reprint author), CALTECH, Computat & Neural Syst, MC228-77, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA.",swlee@caltech.edu,"Lee, Sang Wan/B-9008-2016; O'Doherty, John P/F-1204-2013","Lee, Sang Wan/0000-0001-6266-9613","NIH - OppNet, NIH's Basic Behavioral and Social Science Opportunity Network) [DA033077-01]; Gordon and Betty foundation; JST-CREST; Caltech-Tamagawa gCOE","This work was funded by NIH grant DA033077-01 (supported by OppNet, NIH's Basic Behavioral and Social Science Opportunity Network; http://oppnet.nih.gov/index.asp) to JPOD, by funds from the Gordon and Betty foundation (http://www.moore.org/) to JPOD, by grants from JST-CREST (http://www.jst.go.jp/kisoken/crest/en/) to SS, and by the Caltech-Tamagawa gCOE (http://gcoe.tamagawa.ac.jp/index-e.html) to SS and JPOD.

This is achieved by the pruning of redundant blood vessel segments, which then allows more efficient blood flow patterns. Because of the lack of an in vivo system suitable for high-resolution live imaging, the dynamics of the pruning process have not been described in detail. Here, we present the subintestinal vein (SIV) plexus of the zebrafish embryo as a novel model to study pruning at the cellular level. We show that blood vessel regression is a coordinated process of cell rearrangements involving lumen collapse and cell-cell contact resolution. Interestingly, the cellular rearrangements during pruning resemble endothelial cell behavior during vessel fusion in a reversed order. In pruning segments, endothelial cells first migrate toward opposing sides where they join the parental vascular branches, thus remodeling the multicellular segment into a unicellular connection. Often, the lumen is maintained throughout this process, and transient unicellular tubes form through cell self-fusion. In a second step, the unicellular connection is resolved unilaterally, and the pruning cell rejoins the opposing branch. Thus, we show for the first time that various cellular activities are coordinated to achieve blood vessel pruning and define two different morphogenetic pathways, which are selected by the flow environment.","[Lenard, Anna; Betz, Charles; Ellertsdottir, Elin; Belting, Heinz-Georg; Affolter, Markus] Univ Basel, Biozentrum, Basel, Switzerland; [Daetwyler, Stephan; Huisken, Jan] Max Planck Inst Mol Cell Biol & Genet, Dresden, Germany","Lenard, A (reprint author), Univ Basel, Biozentrum, Basel, Switzerland.",anna.lenard@unibas.ch; markus.affolter@unibas.ch,"Betz, Charles/B-7444-2008; Huisken, Jan/P-7211-2019","Betz, Charles/0000-0002-9837-6916; Huisken, Jan/0000-0001-7250-3756; Affolter, Markus/0000-0002-5171-0016; Belting, Heinz-Georg/0000-0002-1538-4364; Daetwyler, Stephan/0000-0002-7444-4734",Swiss National Science Foundation [310030B_138651]; Krebsliga Schweiz Foundation [KLS 3177-02-2013]; Novartis Stiftung fur Medizinisch-Biologische Forschung [13A40]; Human Frontier Science Program [CDA00063/2010C],"Work in the MA lab was supported by the Swiss National Science Foundation (310030B_138651), the Krebsliga Schweiz Foundation (KLS 3177-02-2013), and the Novartis Stiftung fur Medizinisch-Biologische Forschung (13A40).

A classification system of NIS, based on the magnitude of their environmental impacts, was recently proposed to assist management. Here, we consider the potential application of this classification scheme to the marine environment, and offer a complementary framework focussing on value sets in order to explicitly address marine management concerns. Since existing data on marine NIS impacts are scarce and successful marine removals are rare, we propose that management of marine NIS adopt a precautionary approach, which not only would emphasise preventing new incursions through pre-border and at-border controls but also should influence the categorisation of impacts. The study of marine invasion impacts requires urgent attention and significant investment, since we lack the luxury of waiting for the knowledge base to be acquired before the window of opportunity closes for feasible management.","[Ojaveer, Henn] Univ Tartu, Estonian Marine Inst, Parnu, Estonia; [Galil, Bella S.] Israel Oceanog & Limnol Res, Natl Inst Oceanog, Haifa, Israel; [Campbell, Marnie L.] Univ Waikato, Environm Res Inst, Hamilton, New Zealand; [Carlton, James T.] Williams Coll, Maritime Studies Program, Mystic, CT USA; [Carlton, James T.] Myst Seaport, Mystic, CT USA; [Canning-Clode, Joao] Univ Azores, Inst Mar, Dept Oceanog & Fisheries, Horta, Portugal; [Canning-Clode, Joao] MARE Marine & Environm Sci Ctr, Funchal, Portugal; [Canning-Clode, Joao; Ruiz, Gregory] Smithsonian Environm Res Ctr, Marine Invas Res Lab, Edgewater, MD 21037 USA; [Cook, Elizabeth J.] Scottish Assoc Marine Sci, Scottish Marine Inst, Oban, Argyll, Scotland; [Davidson, Alisha D.] Wayne State Univ, Dept Biol, Detroit, MI USA; [Hewitt, Chad L.] Univ Waikato, Sch Sci, Hamilton, New Zealand; [Jelmert, Anders] Inst Marine Res, Flodevigen Marine Res Stn, His, Norway; [Marchini, Agnese; Occhipinti-Ambrogi, Anna] Univ Pavia, Dept Earth & Environm Sci, I-27100 Pavia, Italy; [McKenzie, Cynthia H.] Fisheries & Oceans Canada, Northwest Atlantic Fisheries Ctr, St John, NF, Canada; [Minchin, Dan; Olenin, Sergej] Klaipeda Univ, Marine Sci & Technol Ctr, Klaipeda, Lithuania","Ojaveer, H (reprint author), Univ Tartu, Estonian Marine Inst, Parnu, Estonia.",henn.ojaveer@ut.ee,"Marchini, Agnese/J-9256-2012; Hewitt, Chad L/J-2105-2019; Canning-Clode, Joao/I-4343-2019; Ojaveer, Henn/K-2160-2016","Marchini, Agnese/0000-0003-4580-0522; Hewitt, Chad L/0000-0002-6859-6512; Canning-Clode, Joao/0000-0003-2143-6535; Ojaveer, Henn/0000-0003-2742-6063; Olenin, Sergej/0000-0002-0773-1442; Ruiz, Gregory/0000-0003-2499-441X; OCCHIPINTI, ANNA CARMEN/0000-0002-5737-8317",European Union [266445]; Estonian Ministry of Education and Research [SF0180005s10]; FCT [SFRH/BPD/75775/2011],"The research leading to these results has also received funding from the European Union's Seventh Framework Programme for research, technological development and demonstration (FP7/2007-2013) within The Ocean of Tomorrow call under Grant Agreement No. 266445 for the project Vectors of Change in Oceans and Seas Marine Life, Impact on Economic Sectors (VECTORS).

Here, we identify two genes, ufd-2 and spr-5, that when inactivated, synergistically and robustly suppress neurotoxicity associated with misfolded proteins in Caenorhabditis elegans. Loss of human orthologs ubiquitination factor E4 B (UBE4B) and lysine-specific demethylase 1 (LSD1), respectively encoding a ubiquitin ligase and a lysine-specific demethylase, promotes the clearance of misfolded proteins in mammalian cells by activating both proteasomal and autophagic degradation machineries. An unbiased search in this pathway reveals a downstream effector as the transcription factor p53, a shared substrate of UBE4B and LSD1 that functions as a key regulator of protein quality control to protect against proteotoxicity. These studies identify a new protein quality control pathway via regulation of transcription factors and point to the augmentation of protein quality control as a wide-spectrum antiproteotoxicity strategy.","[Periz, Goran; Lu, Jiayin; Zhang, Tao; Wang, Jiou] Johns Hopkins Univ, Bloomberg Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Biochem & Mol Biol, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA; [Periz, Goran; Lu, Jiayin; Zhang, Tao; Wang, Jiou] Johns Hopkins Univ, Bloomberg Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Neurosci, Baltimore, MD USA; [Periz, Goran; Lu, Jiayin; Zhang, Tao; Wang, Jiou] Johns Hopkins Univ, Sch Med, Baltimore, MD USA; [Kankel, Mark W.; McCampbell, Alexander] Biogen Idec Inc, Cambridge, MA USA; [Jablonski, Angela M.] Univ Penn, Perelman Sch Med, Dept Neurosci, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Kalb, Robert] Univ Penn, Perelman Sch Med, Dept Neurol & Pediat, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA","Periz, G (reprint author), Johns Hopkins Univ, Bloomberg Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Biochem & Mol Biol, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA.",jiouw@jhu.edu,,,"NIH [NS074324, NS062089]; DOD [W81XWH-12-1-0570]; Robert Packard Center for ALS Research at Johns Hopkins; JHU-Biogen IDEC consortium","This work was supported by NIH (NS074324 and NS062089), DOD (W81XWH-12-1-0570), the Robert Packard Center for ALS Research at Johns Hopkins, and the JHU-Biogen IDEC consortium.

However, how ciliogenesis is regulated during the cell cycle remains largely unknown. Here we show that GSK3 beta, Dzip1, and Rab8 co-regulate ciliogenesis by promoting the assembly of the ciliary membrane after mitosis. Immunofluorescence and super-resolution microscopy showed that Dzip1 was localized to the periciliary diffusion barrier and enriched at the mother centriole. Knockdown of Dzip1 by short hairpin RNAs led to failed ciliary localization of Rab8, and Rab8 accumulation at the basal body. Dzip1 preferentially bound to Rab8(GDP) and promoted its dissociation from its inhibitor GDI2 at the pericentriolar region, as demonstrated by sucrose gradient centrifugation of purified basal bodies, immunoprecipitation, and acceptor-bleaching fluorescence resonance energy transfer assays. By means of in vitro phosphorylation, in vivo gel shift, phospho-peptide identification by mass spectrometry, and GST pulldown assays, we demonstrated that Dzip1 was phosphorylated by GSK3 beta at S520 in G0 phase, which increased its binding to GDI2 to promote the release of Rab8(GDP) at the cilium base. Moreover, ciliogenesis was inhibited by overexpression of the GSK3 beta-nonphosphorylatable Dzip1 mutant or by disabling of GSK3 beta by specific inhibitors or knockout of GSK3 beta in cells. Collectively, our data reveal a unique cascade consisting of GSK3 beta, Dzip1, and Rab8 that regulates ciliogenesis after mitosis.","[Zhang, Boyan] Peking Univ, Key Lab Cell Proliferat & Differentiat, Minist Educ, Coll Life Sci, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China; Peking Univ, State Key Lab Biomembrane & Membrane Biotechnol, Coll Life Sci, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China","Zhang, BY (reprint author), Peking Univ, Key Lab Cell Proliferat & Differentiat, Minist Educ, Coll Life Sci, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China.",zhangcm@pku.edu.cn,"Wang, Gang/Q-7267-2019","Zhang, Boyan/0000-0001-7112-9870","State Key Basic Research and Development Plan [2014CB138402, 2010CB833705]; National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [31430051, 31371365, 91313302, 31030044]","This work was supported by funds to CMZ from the State Key Basic Research and Development Plan (2014CB138402 and 2010CB833705) and the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC, www.nsfc.gov.cn) (31430051, 31371365, 91313302 and 31030044).

The EnvZ/OmpR two-component system responds to osmotic stress and regulates expression of outer membrane proteins. In Salmonella, EnvZ/OmpR also controls expression of another two-component system SsrA/B, which is located on Salmonella Pathogenicity Island (SPI) 2. SPI-2 encodes a type III secretion system, which functions as a nanomachine to inject bacterial effector proteins into eukaryotic cells. During the intracellular phase of infection, Salmonella switches from assembling type III secretion system structural components to secreting effectors into the macrophage cytoplasm, enabling Salmonella to replicate in the phagocytic vacuole. Major questions remain regarding how bacteria survive the acidified vacuole and how acidification affects bacterial secretion. We previously reported that EnvZ sensed cytoplasmic signals rather than extracellular ones, as intracellular osmolytes altered the dynamics of a 17-amino-acid region flanking the phosphorylated histidine. We reasoned that the Salmonella cytoplasm might acidify in the macrophage vacuole to activate OmpR-dependent transcription of SPI-2 genes. To address these questions, we employed a DNA-based FRET biosensor (""I-switch"") to measure bacterial cytoplasmic pH and immunofluorescence to monitor effector secretion during infection. Surprisingly, we observed a rapid drop in bacterial cytoplasmic pH upon phagocytosis that was not predicted by current models. Cytoplasmic acidification was completely dependent on the OmpR response regulator, but did not require known OmpR-regulated genes such as ompC, ompF, or ssaC (SPI-2). Microarray analysis highlighted the cadC/BA operon, and additional experiments confirmed that it was repressed by OmpR. Acidification was blocked in the ompR null background in a Cad-dependent manner. Acid-dependent activation of OmpR stimulated type III secretion; blocking acidification resulted in a neutralized cytoplasm that was defective for SPI-2 secretion. Based upon these findings, we propose that Salmonella infection involves an acid-dependent secretion process in which the translocon SseB moves away from the bacterial cell surface as it associates with the vacuolar membrane, driving the secretion of SPI-2 effectors such as SseJ. New steps in the SPI-2 secretion process are proposed.","[Chakraborty, Smarajit; Mizusaki, Hideaki; Kenney, Linda J.] Natl Univ Singapore, Mechanobiol Inst, Singapore 117548, Singapore; [Kenney, Linda J.] Jesse Brown Vet Affairs Med Ctr, Chicago, IL USA; [Kenney, Linda J.] Univ Illinois, Dept Microbiol & Immunol, Chicago, IL 60680 USA","Chakraborty, S (reprint author), Natl Univ Singapore, Mechanobiol Inst, Singapore 117548, Singapore.",kenneyl@uic.edu,,,Veterans Affairs [5I0BX000372]; Research Centre of Excellence Grant from Ministry of Education to Mechanobiology,"This study was supported by Veterans Affairs 5I0BX000372 grant to LJK and a Research Centre of Excellence Grant from Ministry of Education to Mechanobiology to LJK.

However, this prediction has not been borne out in practice: while the range of Nc spans many orders of magnitude, levels of genetic diversity within species fall in a comparatively narrow range. Although theoretical arguments have invoked the increased efficacy of natural selection in larger populations to explain this discrepancy, few direct empirical tests of this hypothesis have been conducted. In this work, we provide a direct test of this hypothesis using population genomic data from a wide range of taxonomically diverse species. To do this, we relied on the fact that the impact of natural selection on linked neutral diversity depends on the local recombinational environment. In regions of relatively low recombination, selected variants affect more neutral sites through linkage, and the resulting correlation between recombination and polymorphism allows a quantitative assessment of the magnitude of the impact of selection on linked neutral diversity. By comparing whole genome polymorphism data and genetic maps using a coalescent modeling framework, we estimate the degree to which natural selection reduces linked neutral diversity for 40 species of obligately sexual eukaryotes. We then show that the magnitude of the impact of natural selection is positively correlated with Nc, based on body size and species range as proxies for census population size. These results demonstrate that natural selection removes more variation at linked neutral sites in species with large Nc than those with small Nc and provides direct empirical evidence that natural selection constrains levels of neutral genetic diversity across many species. This implies that natural selection may provide an explanation for this longstanding paradox of population genetics.","[Corbett-Detig, Russell B.; Hartl, Daniel L.; Sackton, Timothy B.] Harvard Univ, Dept Organism & Evolutionary Biol, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Corbett-Detig, Russell B.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Integrat Biol, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA","Corbett-Detig, RB (reprint author), Harvard Univ, Dept Organism & Evolutionary Biol, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",tsackton@oeb.harvard.edu,,"Sackton, Timothy/0000-0003-1673-9216","National Institute of Health [R01GM084236, AI099105, AI106734]; Harvard Prize Graduate Fellowship; UCB Chancellor's Postdoctoral Fellowship","This work was supported in part by National Institute of Health grants R01GM084236, AI099105 and AI106734 to DLH.

Thus, reports that resistance to artemisinins (ARTs) has emerged, and that the prevalence of this resistance is increasing, are alarming. ART resistance has recently been linked to mutations in the K13 propeller protein. We undertook a detailed kinetic analysis of the drug responses of K13 wild-type and mutant isolates of Plasmodium falciparum sourced from a region in Cambodia (Pailin). We demonstrate that ART treatment induces growth retardation and an accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins, indicative of a cellular stress response that engages the ubiquitin/proteasome system. We show that resistant parasites exhibit lower levels of ubiquitinated proteins and delayed onset of cell death, indicating an enhanced cell stress response. We found that the stress response can be targeted by inhibiting the proteasome. Accordingly, clinically used proteasome inhibitors strongly synergize ART activity against both sensitive and resistant parasites, including isogenic lines expressing mutant or wild-type K13. Synergy is also observed against Plasmodium berghei in vivo. We developed a detailed model of parasite responses that enables us to infer, for the first time, in vivo parasite clearance profiles from in vitro assessments of ART sensitivity. We provide evidence that the clinical marker of resistance (delayed parasite clearance) is an indirect measure of drug efficacy because of the persistence of unviable parasites with unchanged morphology in the circulation, and we suggest alternative approaches for the direct measurement of viability. Our model predicts that extending current three-day ART treatment courses to four days, or splitting the doses, will efficiently clear resistant parasite infections. This work provides a rationale for improving the detection of ART resistance in the field and for treatment strategies that can be employed in areas with ART resistance.","[Dogovski, Con; Xie, Stanley C.; Bridgford, Jess; Kenny, Shannon; Klonis, Nectarios; Tilley, Leann] Univ Melbourne, Dept Biochem & Mol Biol, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Dogovski, Con; Xie, Stanley C.; Bridgford, Jess; Kenny, Shannon; Klonis, Nectarios; Tilley, Leann] Univ Melbourne, ARC Ctr Excellence Coherent Xray Sci, Mol Sci & Biotechnol Inst Bio21, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Burgio, Gaetan; Foote, Simon] Australian Natl Univ, John Curtin Sch Med Res, Canberra, ACT 2601, Australia; [Burgio, Gaetan] Macquarie Univ, Australian Sch Adv Med, Sydney, NSW 2109, Australia; [Mok, Sachel; Bozdech, Zbynek] Nanyang Technol Univ, Sch Biol Sci, Singapore 639798, Singapore; [McCaw, James M.; Simpson, Julie A.] Univ Melbourne, Melbourne Sch Populat & Global Hlth, Ctr Epidemiol & Biostat, Parkville, Vic 3052, Australia; [McCaw, James M.] Royal Childrens Hosp, Murdoch Childrens Res Inst, Parkville, Vic, Australia; [Chotivanich, Kesinee; Dondorp, Arjen M.] Mahidol Univ, Fac Trop Med, Bangkok, Thailand; [Gnaedig, Nina; Straimer, Judith; Fidock, David A.] Columbia Univ, Dept Microbiol & Immunol, Med Ctr, New York, NY USA; [Fidock, David A.] Columbia Univ, Dept Med, Div Infect Dis, Med Ctr, New York, NY USA; [Dondorp, Arjen M.] Ctr Trop Med, Nuffield Dept Clin Med, Oxford, England","Dogovski, C (reprint author), Univ Melbourne, Dept Biochem & Mol Biol, Melbourne, Vic, Australia.",ltilley@unimelb.edu.au,"Bozdech, Zbynek/A-2205-2011","Bozdech, Zbynek/0000-0002-9830-8446; Fidock, David/0000-0001-6753-8938; Bridgford, Jessica/0000-0001-8381-1121; McCaw, James/0000-0002-2452-3098; Foote, Simon/0000-0002-9142-2107; Mok, Sachel/0000-0002-9605-0154; Xie, Stanley/0000-0001-7003-4677","National Health & Medical Research Council of Australia [541904]; Australia Research Council [CE0561787, DP110100624]; Singapore National Medical Council [NMRC/1265/2010]; National Institutes of Health, USA [R01 AI109023]","This work was supported by the National Health & Medical Research Council of Australia (Grant#541904), the Australia Research Council (Grants: CE0561787 & DP110100624), the Singapore National Medical Council (NMRC/1265/2010), and National Institutes of Health, USA (R01 AI109023, to DAF).

It leads to PT growth arrest, rupture, and sperm cell release, and is thus essential to ensure double fertilization. Here, we describe TURAN (TUN) and EVAN (EVN), two novel members of the PT reception pathway that is mediated by the FERONIA (FER) receptor-like kinase (RLK). Like fer, mutations in these two genes lead to PT overgrowth inside the female gametophyte (FG) without PT rupture. Mapping by next-generation sequencing, cytological analysis of reporter genes, and biochemical assays of glycoproteins in RNAi knockdown mutants revealed both genes to be involved in protein N-glycosylation in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). TUN encodes a uridine diphosphate (UDP)-glycosyltransferase superfamily protein and EVN a dolichol kinase. In addition to their common role during PT reception in the synergids, both genes have distinct functions in the pollen: whereas EVN is essential for pollen development, TUN is required for PT growth and integrity by affecting the stability of the pollen-specific FER homologs ANXUR1 (ANX1) and ANX2. ANX1-and ANX2-YFP reporters are not expressed in tun pollen grains, but ANX1-YFP is degraded via the ER-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway, likely underlying the anx1/2-like premature PT rupture phenotype of tun mutants. Thus, as in animal sperm-egg interactions, protein glycosylation is essential for the interaction between the female and male gametophytes during PT reception to ensure fertilization and successful reproduction.","[Lindner, Heike] Univ Zurich, Inst Plant Biol, CH-8008 Zurich, Switzerland; Univ Zurich, Zurich Basel Plant Sci Ctr, CH-8008 Zurich, Switzerland","Lindner, H (reprint author), Univ Zurich, Inst Plant Biol, CH-8008 Zurich, Switzerland.",grossnik@botinst.uzh.ch,"Kessler, Sharon/T-4784-2017; Grossniklaus, Ueli/E-9995-2016","Kessler, Sharon/0000-0002-7964-0451; Grossniklaus, Ueli/0000-0002-0522-8974; Muller, Lena Maria/0000-0002-6036-4514; Boisson-Dernier, Aurelien/0000-0002-9790-3710","University of Zurich; Swiss National Science Foundation (SNF) [31003AB_126006, 31003A_141245]; SNF [PDFMP3_129948, PDFMP3_137058]","This work was funded by the University of Zurich, grants from the Swiss National Science Foundation (SNF, 31003AB_126006 and 31003A_141245; www.snf.ch) to UG, and partial support for HL and LMM through Research Modules of the SNF ProDoc Programs 'Molecular Life Science' (PDFMP3_129948) and 'Plant Science and Policy' (PDFMP3_137058), respectively, to UG.

In this study, we show how flagellum-independent migration is driven by the division of labor of two cell types that appear during Bacillus subtilis sliding motility. Cell collectives organize themselves into bundles (called ""van Gogh bundles"") of tightly aligned cell chains that form filamentous loops at the colony edge. We show, by time-course microscopy, that these loops migrate by pushing themselves away from the colony. The formation of van Gogh bundles depends critically on the synergistic interaction of surfactin-producing and matrix-producing cells. We propose that surfactin-producing cells reduce the friction between cells and their substrate, thereby facilitating matrix-producing cells to form bundles. The folding properties of these bundles determine the rate of colony expansion. Our study illustrates how the simple organization of cells within a community can yield a strong ecological advantage.

Diptera flies, which include the model Drosophila melanogaster, generally have XY sex chromosomes and a conserved karyotype consisting of six chromosomal arms (five large rods and a small dot), but superficially similar karyotypes may conceal the true extent of sex chromosome variation. Here, we use whole-genome analysis in 37 fly species belonging to 22 different families of Diptera and uncover tremendous hidden diversity in sex chromosome karyotypes among flies. We identify over a dozen different sex chromosome configurations, and the small dot chromosome is repeatedly used as the sex chromosome, which presumably reflects the ancestral karyotype of higher Diptera. However, we identify species with undifferentiated sex chromosomes, others in which a different chromosome replaced the dot as a sex chromosome or in which up to three chromosomal elements became incorporated into the sex chromosomes, and others yet with female heterogamety (ZW sex chromosomes). Transcriptome analysis shows that dosage compensation has evolved multiple times in flies, consistently through up-regulation of the single X in males. However, X chromosomes generally show a deficiency of genes with male-biased expression, possibly reflecting sex-specific selective pressures. These species thus provide a rich resource to study sex chromosome biology in a comparative manner and show that similar selective forces have shaped the unique evolution of sex chromosomes in diverse fly taxa.","[Vicoso, Beatriz; Bachtrog, Doris] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Integrat Biol, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA","Vicoso, B (reprint author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Integrat Biol, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",dbachtrog@berkeley.edu,,"Vicoso, Beatriz/0000-0002-4579-8306","NIH [R01GM076007, R01GM093182]","This research was funded by NIH grants (R01GM076007 and R01GM093182) to DB.

Yet, the environmental variables driving this selection have rarely been identified, limiting our ability to predict future ecological impacts of climate change. Using a dataset spanning 31 years from a natural population of pied flycatchers (Ficedula hypoleuca), we show that directional selection on timing of reproduction intensified in the first two decades (1980-2000) but weakened during the last decade (2001-2010). Against expectation, this pattern could not be explained by the temporal variation in the phenological mismatch with food abundance. We therefore explored an alternative hypothesis that selection on timing was affected by conditions individuals experience when arriving in spring at the breeding grounds: arriving early in cold conditions may reduce survival. First, we show that in female recruits, spring arrival date in the first breeding year correlates positively with hatch date; hence, early-hatched individuals experience colder conditions at arrival than late-hatched individuals. Second, we show that when temperatures at arrival in the recruitment year were high, early-hatched young had a higher recruitment probability than when temperatures were low. We interpret this as a potential cost of arriving early in colder years, and climate warming may have reduced this cost. We thus show that higher temperatures in the arrival year of recruits were associated with stronger selection for early reproduction in the years these birds were born. As arrival temperatures in the beginning of the study increased, but recently declined again, directional selection on timing of reproduction showed a nonlinear change. We demonstrate that environmental conditions with a lag of up to two years can alter selection on phenological traits in natural populations, something that has important implications for our understanding of how climate can alter patterns of selection in natural populations.","[Visser, Marcel E.; Gienapp, Phillip; de la Hera, Ivan; Pulido, Francisco; Both, Christiaan] Netherlands Inst Ecol NIOO KNAW, Dept Anim Ecol, Wageningen, Netherlands; [Husby, Arild] Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Ctr Biodivers Dynam, Dept Biol, N-7034 Trondheim, Norway; [Husby, Arild] Univ Helsinki, Dept Biosci, Helsinki, Finland; [Morrisey, Michael] Univ St Andrews, Sch Biol, St Andrews, Fife, Scotland; [de la Hera, Ivan] Univ Pais Vasco UPV EHU, Dept Zool & Anim Cell Biol, Vitoria, Spain; [Pulido, Francisco] Univ Complutense Madrid, Dept Zool & Phys Anthropol, Madrid, Spain; [Both, Christiaan] Univ Groningen, Ctr Ecol & Evolutionary Studies, Anim Ecol Grp, Groningen, Netherlands","Visser, ME (reprint author), Netherlands Inst Ecol NIOO KNAW, Dept Anim Ecol, Wageningen, Netherlands.",m.visser@nioo.knaw.nl,"Pulido, Francisco/C-6697-2012; Morrissey, Michael/F-3226-2010; Both, Christiaan/E-6459-2011; Gienapp, Phillip/H-3228-2019; de la Hera, Ivan/C-3652-2011; Husby, Arild/E-9821-2010; Library, Library/A-4320-2012; Group, Evolution and Conservation Biology UCM/K-9382-2014; Visser, Marcel E/A-9151-2009","Pulido, Francisco/0000-0002-2430-8080; Morrissey, Michael/0000-0001-6209-0177; Both, Christiaan/0000-0001-7099-9831; Gienapp, Phillip/0000-0002-9368-8769; Library, Library/0000-0002-3835-159X; Group, Evolution and Conservation Biology UCM/0000-0002-6308-1288; Visser, Marcel E/0000-0002-1456-1939; Husby, Arild/0000-0003-1911-8351","NWO-VICI; NWO-VIDI; Department of Education, Universities and Research of the Basque Government; Norwegian Research Council","MEV was supported by a NWO-VICI grant, CB by a NWO-VIDI grant, IH by a fellowship of the Department of Education, Universities and Research of the Basque Government and AH by a grant from the Norwegian Research Council.

Animals use the variation in irradiance to adjust their internal circadian clocks, aligning their behaviour and physiology with the solar cycle. However, it is currently unknown whether changes in colour also contribute to this entrainment process. Using environmental measurements, we show here that mammalian blue-yellow colour discrimination provides a more reliable method of tracking twilight progression than simply measuring irradiance. We next use electrophysiological recordings to demonstrate that neurons in the mouse supra-chiasmatic circadian clock display the cone-dependent spectral opponency required to make use of this information. Thus, our data show that some clock neurons are highly sensitive to changes in spectral composition occurring over twilight and that this input dictates their response to changes in irradiance. Finally, using mice housed under photoperiods with simulated dawn/dusk transitions, we confirm that spectral changes occurring during twilight are required for appropriate circadian alignment under natural conditions. Together, these data reveal a new sensory mechanism for telling time of day that would be available to any mammalian species capable of chromatic vision.","[Walmsley, Lauren; Hanna, Lydia; Mouland, Josh; Martial, Franck; West, Alexander; Bechtold, David A.; Lucas, Robert J.; Brown, Timothy M.] Univ Manchester, Fac Life Sci, Manchester, Lancs, England; [Smedley, Andrew R.; Webb, Ann R.] Univ Manchester, Sch Earth Atmospher & Environm Sci, Manchester, Lancs, England","Walmsley, L (reprint author), Univ Manchester, Fac Life Sci, Manchester, Lancs, England.",robert.lucas@manchester.ac.uk; timothy.brown@manchester.ac.uk,"Smedley, Andrew/N-7194-2019","Smedley, Andrew/0000-0001-7137-6628; Brown, Timothy/0000-0002-5625-4750; Bechtold, David/0000-0001-8676-8704; Mouland, Joshua William/0000-0003-4309-3668; Lucas, Robert/0000-0002-1088-8029","Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council [BB/I017836/1, BB/I018654/1]; European Research Council; Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council [1200479, BB/J017744/1]","Funded by Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (www.bbsrc.ac.uk) grants BB/I017836/1 (TMB), BB/I018654/1 (DAB) and European Research Council (www.erc.europa.eu) Melovision (RJL).

During DNA replication, the Mms21-branch of the SUMO pathway counteracts recombination intermediates at damaged replication forks, thus facilitating sister chromatid disjunction. The Mms21 SUMO ligase docks to the arm region of the Smc5 protein in the Smc5/6 complex; together, they cooperate during recombinational DNA repair. Yet how the activity of the SUMO ligase is controlled remains unknown. Here we show that the SUMO ligase and the chromosome disjunction functions of Mms21 depend on its docking to an intact and active Smc5/6 complex, indicating that the Smc5/6-Mms21 complex operates as a large SUMO ligase in vivo. In spite of the physical distance separating the E3 and the nucleotide-binding domains in Smc5/6, Mms21-dependent sumoylation requires binding of ATP to Smc5, a step that is part of the ligase mechanism that assists Ubc9 function. The communication is enabled by the presence of a conserved disruption in the coiled coil domain of Smc5, pointing to potential conformational changes for SUMO ligase activation. In accordance, scanning force microscopy of the Smc5-Mms21 heterodimer shows that the molecule is physically remodeled in an ATP-dependent manner. Our results demonstrate that the ATP-binding activity of the Smc5/6 complex is coordinated with its SUMO ligase, through the coiled coil domain of Smc5 and the physical remodeling of the molecule, to promote sumoylation and chromosome disjunction during DNA repair.","[Bermudez-Lopez, Marcelino; Pocino-Merino, Irene; Bueno, Andres; Guasch, Claudia; Almedawar, Seba; Gari, Eloi; Colomina, Neus; Torres-Rosell, Jordi] Univ Lleida, Dept Ciencies Med Basiques, IRBLLEIDA, Lleida, Spain; [Sanchez, Humberto; Wyman, Claire] Erasmus MC, Dept Genet & Radiat Oncol, Rotterdam, Netherlands; [Bru-Virgili, Sergi; Reverter, David] Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Dept Bioquim & Biol Mol, Inst Biotecnol & Biomed, Bellaterra, Spain","Bermudez-Lopez, M (reprint author), Univ Lleida, Dept Ciencies Med Basiques, IRBLLEIDA, Lleida, Spain.",jordi.torres@cmb.udl.cat,"Sanchez, Humberto/L-7776-2015; Torres-Rosell, Jordi/A-4213-2010; Gari, Eloi/A-5996-2010; Bermudez-Lopez, Marcelino/C-3787-2011; Colomina Gabarrella, Neus/C-4449-2011; Reverter, David/H-5360-2015","Sanchez, Humberto/0000-0003-2137-1233; Torres-Rosell, Jordi/0000-0003-1308-6926; Gari, Eloi/0000-0002-3505-4901; Bermudez-Lopez, Marcelino/0000-0002-3188-4158; Colomina Gabarrella, Neus/0000-0002-1986-1199; Reverter, David/0000-0002-5347-0992; Almedawar, Seba/0000-0001-5115-266X","Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitivity [BFU2012-39656, BFU2013-50245-EXP, BFU2012-37116, BES-2010-034300]; NanoNextNL; micro and nanotechnology consortium of the Government of the Netherlands; Reintegration Grant [FP7-276898]","Work in JTR's laboratory is supported by grants BFU2012-39656 and BFU2013-50245-EXP from the Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitivity http://www.idi.mineco.gob.es/.

This prevalence has allowed the elucidation of a number of underlying molecular mechanisms. However, little is known about how phenotypic switches arise and function in their early evolutionary stages. The first opportunity to provide empirical insight was delivered by an experiment in which populations of the bacterium Pseudomonas fluorescens SBW25 evolved, de novo, the ability to switch between two colony phenotypes. Here we unravel the molecular mechanism behind colony switching, revealing how a single nucleotide change in a gene enmeshed in central metabolism (carB) generates such a striking phenotype. We show that colony switching is underpinned by ON/OFF expression of capsules consisting of a colanic acid-like polymer. We use molecular genetics, biochemical analyses, and experimental evolution to establish that capsule switching results from perturbation of the pyrimidine biosynthetic pathway. Of central importance is a bifurcation point at which uracil triphosphate is partitioned towards either nucleotide metabolism or polymer production. This bifurcation marks a cell-fate decision point whereby cells with relatively high pyrimidine levels favour nucleotide metabolism (capsule OFF), while cells with lower pyrimidine levels divert resources towards polymer biosynthesis (capsule ON). This decision point is present and functional in the wild-type strain. Finally, we present a simple mathematical model demonstrating that the molecular components of the decision point are capable of producing switching. Despite its simple mutational cause, the connection between genotype and phenotype is complex and multidimensional, offering a rare glimpse of how noise in regulatory networks can provide opportunity for evolution.","[Gallie, Jenna; Libby, Eric; Bertels, Frederic; Remigi, Philippe; Ferguson, Gayle C.; Beaumont, Hubertus J.

How this complex process is controlled at the molecular level is still largely unknown. Here, we report that the centrosomal microtubule (MT)-binding protein CAP350 localises at adherens junctions in epithelial cells. By two-hybrid screening, we identified a direct interaction of CAP350 with the adhesion protein alpha-catenin that was further confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation experiments. Block of epithelial cadherin (E-cadherin)-mediated cell-cell adhesion or alpha-catenin depletion prevented CAP350 localisation at cell-cell junctions. Knocking down junction-located CAP350 inhibited the establishment of an apico-basal array of microtubules and impaired the acquisition of columnar shape in Madin-Darby canine kidney II (MDCKII) cells grown as polarised epithelia. Furthermore, MDCKII cystogenesis was also defective in junctional CAP350-depleted cells. CAP350-depleted MDCKII cysts were smaller and contained either multiple lumens or no lumen. Membrane polarity was not affected, but cortical microtubule bundles did not properly form. Our results indicate that CAP350 may act as an adaptor between adherens junctions and microtubules, thus regulating epithelial differentiation and contributing to the definition of cell architecture. We also uncover a central role of alpha-catenin in global cytoskeleton remodelling, in which it acts not only on actin but also on MT reorganisation during epithelial morphogenesis.","[Gavilan, Maria P.; Arjona, Marina; Zurbano, Angel; Rios, Rosa M.] CSIC, Ctr Andaluz Biol Mol & Med Regenerat CABIMER, E-41080 Seville, Spain; [Formstecher, Etienne] Hybrigen Serv SA, Paris, France; [Martinez-Morales, Juan R.] CSIC UPO JA, Ctr Andaluz Biol Desarrollo, Seville, Spain; [Bornens, Michel] Inst Curie, CNRS, UMR144, F-75231 Paris, France","Gavilan, MP (reprint author), CSIC, Ctr Andaluz Biol Mol & Med Regenerat CABIMER, E-41080 Seville, Spain.",rosa.rios@cabimer.es,"Gavilan, Maria P/H-6812-2015; rios, rosa m/G-5742-2015","Gavilan, Maria P/0000-0003-3694-8525; rios, rosa m/0000-0001-5778-6946; Martinez-Morales, Juan R./0000-0002-4650-4293","Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad, Spain [BFU2012-36717, CSD2009-00016, BFU2011-22916]; Junta de Andalucia [CVI-7256, CTS-2071]; GenHomme Network [02490-6088]; MEC-FPI Grants","This work was supported by Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad, Spain (BFU2012-36717 and CSD2009-00016 to RMR and BFU2011-22916 to JRM) and by Junta de Andalucia (CVI-7256 and CTS-2071), and by a funding GenHomme Network 02490-6088 to Hybrigenics and the Institut Curie.

Neural adaptation is one important tool to adjust sensitivity to varying intensity ranges. For instance, in a quiet night outdoors, our hearing is more sensitive than when we are confronted with the plurality of sounds in a large city during the day. However, adaptation also removes available information on absolute sound levels and may thus cause ambiguity. Experimental data on the trade-off between benefits and loss through adaptation is scarce and very few mechanisms have been proposed to resolve it. We present an example where adaptation is beneficial for one task-namely, the reliable encoding of the pattern of an acoustic signal-but detrimental for another-the localization of the same acoustic stimulus. With a combination of neurophysiological data, modeling, and behavioral tests, we show that adaptation in the periphery of the auditory pathway of grasshoppers enables intensity-invariant coding of amplitude modulations, but at the same time, degrades information available for sound localization. We demonstrate how focusing the response of localization neurons to the onset of relevant signals separates processing of localization and pattern information temporally. In this way, the ambiguity of adaptive coding can be circumvented and both absolute and relative levels can be processed using the same set of peripheral neurons.","[Hildebrandt, K.

Here, we demonstrate a requirement for the basal polarity complex protein Scribble in CNS myelination and remyelination. Scribble is expressed throughout oligodendroglial development and is up-regulated in mature oligodendrocytes where it is localised to both developing and mature CNS myelin sheaths. Knockdown of Scribble expression in cultured oligodendroglia results in disrupted morphology and myelination initiation. When Scribble expression is conditionally eliminated in the myelinating glia of transgenic mice, myelin initiation in CNS is disrupted, both during development and following focal demyelination, and longitudinal extension of the myelin sheath is disrupted. At later stages of myelination, Scribble acts to negatively regulate myelin thickness whilst suppressing the extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK)/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAP) kinase pathway, and localises to non-compact myelin flanking the node of Ranvier where it is required for paranodal axo-glial adhesion. These findings demonstrate an essential role for the evolutionarily-conserved regulators of intracellular polarity in myelination and remyelination.","[Jarjour, Andrew A.; Boyd, Amanda; Holloway, Rebecca K.; Williams, Anna; Ffrench-Constant, Charles] Univ Edinburgh, MRC Ctr Regenerat Med, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland; [Jarjour, Andrew A.; Boyd, Amanda; Holloway, Rebecca K.; Williams, Anna; Ffrench-Constant, Charles] Univ Edinburgh, Scottish Ctr Regenerat Med, Ctr Translat Res, MS Soc, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland; [Dow, Lukas E.; Humbert, Patrick O.] Peter MacCallum Canc Ctr, Cell Cycle & Canc Genet Lab, East Melbourne, Australia; [Goebbels, Sandra] Max Planck Inst Expt Med, D-37075 Gottingen, Germany; [Humbert, Patrick O.] Univ Melbourne, Sir Peter MacCallum Dept Oncol, Parkville, Vic 3052, Australia; [Humbert, Patrick O.] Univ Melbourne, Dept Biochem & Mol Biol, Parkville, Vic 3052, Australia; [Humbert, Patrick O.] Univ Melbourne, Dept Pathol, Parkville, Vic 3052, Australia","Jarjour, AA (reprint author), Univ Edinburgh, MRC Ctr Regenerat Med, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland.",andrew.jarjour@ed.ac.uk,"Humbert, Patrick O/L-4264-2016","Humbert, Patrick O/0000-0002-1366-6691; Jarjour, Andrew/0000-0002-1550-1778; Williams, Anna/0000-0002-6329-382X","Multiple Sclerosis Society of Canada; Medical Research Council [Rg61812-Xbag1178]; Wellcome Trust [08900/1Z1/09z]; UK Multiple Sclerosis Society [891/08]; Wellcome Trust Clinical Intermediate Fellowship [R40590]; Cancer Council Victoria Postgraduate Studentship; NH&MRC Biomedical Career Development Award [566607, 509336]; Medical Research Council [MR/K026666/1, MR/K017047/1]","AAJ was supported by a postdoctoral fellowship from the Multiple Sclerosis Society of Canada (mssociety.ca).

However, the development of an individual's long-lived antibody response to influenza A over the course of a lifetime remains poorly understood. Accurately describing this immunological process requires a fundamental understanding of how the mechanisms of boosting and cross-reactivity respond to repeated infections. Establishing the contribution of such mechanisms to antibody titres remains challenging because the aggregate effect of immune responses over a lifetime are rarely observed directly. To uncover the aggregate effect of multiple influenza infections, we developed a mechanistic model capturing both past infections and subsequent antibody responses. We estimated parameters of the model using cross-sectional antibody titres to nine different strains spanning 40 years of circulation of influenza A(H3N2) in southern China. We found that ""antigenic seniority"" and quickly decaying cross-reactivity were important components of the immune response, suggesting that the order in which individuals were infected with influenza strains shaped observed neutralisation titres to a particular virus. We also obtained estimates of the frequency and age distribution of influenza infection, which indicate that although infections became less frequent as individuals progressed through childhood and young adulthood, they occurred at similar rates for individuals above age 30 y. By establishing what are likely to be important mechanisms driving epochal trends in population immunity, we also identified key directions for future studies. In particular, our results highlight the need for longitudinal samples that are tested against multiple historical strains. This could lead to a better understanding of how, over the course of a lifetime, fast, transient antibody dynamics combine with the longer-term immune responses considered here.","[Kucharski, Adam J.] London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, Dept Infect Dis Epidemiol, London WC1, England; [Kucharski, Adam J.; Riley, Steven] Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Infect Dis Epidemiol, MRC Ctr Outbreak Anal & Modelling, London, England; [Lessler, Justin; Cummings, Derek A.

This aspect of viral infection appears to be important for the adaptation and survival of viruses. To clarify how the number of viral genomes that establish cell infection is determined, we developed a simulation model of cell infection for tomato mosaic virus (ToMV), a positive-strand RNA virus. The model showed that stochastic processes that govern the replication or degradation of individual genomes result in the infection by a small number of genomes, while a large number of infectious genomes are introduced in the cell. It also predicted two interesting characteristics regarding cell infection patterns: stochastic variation among cells in the number of viral genomes that establish infection and stochastic inequality in the accumulation of their progenies in each cell. Both characteristics were validated experimentally by inoculating tobacco cells with a library of nucleotide sequence-tagged ToMV and analyzing the viral genomes that accumulated in each cell using a high-throughput sequencer. An additional simulation model revealed that these two characteristics enhance selection during tissue infection. The cell infection model also predicted a mechanism that enhances selection at the cellular level: a small difference in the replication abilities of coinfected variants results in a large difference in individual accumulation via the multiple-round formation of the replication complex (i.e., the replication machinery). Importantly, this predicted effect was observed in vivo. The cell infection model was robust to changes in the parameter values, suggesting that other viruses could adopt similar adaptation mechanisms. Taken together, these data reveal a comprehensive picture of viral infection processes including replication, cell-to-cell transmission, and evolution, which are based on the stochastic behavior of the viral genome molecules in each cell.","[Miyashita, Shuhei] Japan Sci & Technol Agcy, Precursory Res Embryon Sci & Technol PRESTO, Kawaguchi, Saitama, Japan; [Miyashita, Shuhei; Ishibashi, Kazuhiro; Ishikawa, Masayuki] Natl Inst Agrobiol Sci, Plant Microbe Interact Res Unit, Div Plant Sci, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan; [Kishino, Hirohisa] Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Agr & Life Sci, Tokyo, Japan","Miyashita, S (reprint author), Japan Sci & Technol Agcy, Precursory Res Embryon Sci & Technol PRESTO, Kawaguchi, Saitama, Japan.",smiyashita@live.jp,"Kishino, Hirohisa/U-9311-2019","Miyashita, Shuhei/0000-0002-0092-4903; Ishibashi, Kazuhiro/0000-0002-9349-3603","Precursory Research for Embryonic Science and Technology (PRESTO) program of the Japan Science and Technology Agency (JST); Japan Society for the Promotion of Sciences (JSPS) [2510559]; JSPS [25280006, 25115518]","SM was supported by the Precursory Research for Embryonic Science and Technology (PRESTO) program of the Japan Science and Technology Agency (JST: http://www.jst.go.jp/EN/) and by the Japan Society for the Promotion of Sciences (JSPS: http://www.jsps.go.jp/english/) Research Fellowship for Young Scientists (2510559).

Mice defective for either Shh or Netrin-1 signaling have commissural axon guidance defects, suggesting that both Shh and Netrin-1 are required for correct axon guidance. However, how Shh and Netrin-1 collaborate to guide axons is not known. We first quantified the steepness of the Shh gradient in the spinal cord and found that it is mostly very shallow. We then developed an in vitro microfluidic guidance assay to simulate these shallow gradients. We found that axons of dissociated commissural neurons respond to steep but not shallow gradients of Shh or Netrin-1. However, when we presented axons with combined Shh and Netrin-1 gradients, they had heightened sensitivity to the guidance cues, turning in response to shallower gradients that were unable to guide axons when only one cue was present. Furthermore, these shallow gradients polarized growth cone Src-family kinase (SFK) activity only when Shh and Netrin-1 were combined, indicating that SFKs can integrate the two guidance cues. Together, our results indicate that Shh and Netrin-1 synergize to enable growth cones to sense shallow gradients in regions of the spinal cord where the steepness of a single guidance cue is insufficient to guide axons, and we identify a novel type of synergy that occurs when the steepness (and not the concentration) of a guidance cue is limiting.","[Sloan, Tyler F.

The structural and molecular basis for this remarkable cell cycle flexibility is not fully understood, although the centrosome serves a key role in determining when and how much replication will occur. Here we describe the discovery of multiple replicating core complexes with distinct protein composition and function in the centrosome of Toxoplasma gondii. An outer core complex distal from the nucleus contains the TgCentrin1/TgSfi1 protein pair, along with the cartwheel protein TgSas-6 and a novel Aurora-related kinase, while an inner core closely aligned with the unique spindle pole (centrocone) holds distant orthologs of the CEP250/C-Nap protein family. This outer/inner spatial relationship of centrosome cores is maintained throughout the cell cycle. When in metaphase, the duplicated cores align to opposite sides of the kinetochores in a linear array. As parasites transition into S phase, the cores sequentially duplicate, outer core first and inner core second, ensuring that each daughter parasite inherits one copy of each type of centrosome core. A key serine/threonine kinase distantly related to the MAPK family is localized to the centrosome, where it restricts core duplication to once per cycle and ensures the proper formation of new daughter parasites. Genetic analysis of the outer core in a temperature-sensitive mutant demonstrated this core functions primarily in cytokinesis. An inhibition of ts-TgSfi1 function at high temperature caused the loss of outer cores and a severe block to budding, while at the same time the inner core amplified along with the unique spindle pole, indicating the inner core and spindle pole are independent and co-regulated. The discovery of a novel bipartite organization in the parasite centrosome that segregates the functions of karyokinesis and cytokinesis provides an explanation for how cell cycle flexibility is achieved in apicomplexan life cycles.","[Suvorova, Elena S.; White, Michael W.] Univ S Florida, Dept Mol Med, Tampa, FL 33620 USA; [Suvorova, Elena S.; White, Michael W.] Univ S Florida, Dept Global Hlth, Tampa, FL USA; [Suvorova, Elena S.; White, Michael W.] Univ S Florida, Florida Ctr Drug Discovery & Innovat, Tampa, FL USA; [Francia, Maria; Striepen, Boris] Univ Georgia, Ctr Trop & Emerging Global Dis, Athens, GA 30602 USA; [Francia, Maria; Striepen, Boris] Univ Georgia, Dept Cellular Biol, Athens, GA 30602 USA","Suvorova, ES (reprint author), Univ S Florida, Dept Mol Med, Tampa, FL 33620 USA.",mwhite.usf@gmail.com,,"Francia, Maria/0000-0001-9664-9573; Striepen, Boris/0000-0002-7426-432X","National Institute of Health [R01-AI077662, R01-AI109843, R01-AI64671, R01-AI084415]","The National Institute of Health supported MWW (R01-AI077662 and R01-AI109843) and BS (R01-AI64671 and R01-AI084415).

In the mouse pancreas, lineage tracing at the population level has shown that the expanding pancreas progenitors can initially give rise to all endocrine, ductal, and acinar cells but become bipotent by embryonic day 13.5, giving rise to endocrine cells and ductal cells. However, the dynamics of individual progenitors balancing self-renewal and lineage-specific differentiation has never been described. Using three-dimensional live imaging and in vivo clonal analysis, we reveal the contribution of individual cells to the global behaviour and demonstrate three modes of progenitor divisions: symmetric renewing, symmetric endocrinogenic, and asymmetric generating a progenitor and an endocrine progenitor. Quantitative analysis shows that the endocrine differentiation process is consistent with a simple model of cell cycle-dependent stochastic priming of progenitors to endocrine fate. The findings provide insights to define control parameters to optimize the generation of beta-cells in vitro.","[Kim, Yung Hae; Larsen, Hjalte List; Lemaire, Laurence A.; Grapin-Botton, Anne] Univ Copenhagen, DanStem, Copenhagen, Denmark; [Kim, Yung Hae; Grapin-Botton, Anne] Ecole Polytech Fed Lausanne, Inst Bioengn, Life Sci, Lausanne, Switzerland; [Rue, Pau] Univ Cambridge, Dept Genet, Cambridge CB2 3EH, England; [Ferrer, Jorge] Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Dept Med, London, England; [Ferrer, Jorge] CIBER Diabet & Enfermedades Metab Asociadas, Inst Invest August Pi & Sunyer, Barcelona, Spain","Kim, YH (reprint author), Univ Copenhagen, DanStem, Copenhagen, Denmark.",yung.kim@sund.ku.dk; anne.grapin-botton@sund.ku.dk,"Rue, Pau/A-3374-2009","Rue, Pau/0000-0003-3739-7999; Ferrer, Jorge/0000-0002-5959-5729; List Larsen, Hjalte/0000-0003-0020-0881; Kim, Yung Hae/0000-0002-2932-8689; Grapin-Botton, Anne/0000-0002-1202-5235",Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne; Novo Nordisk Foundation; NIDDK Beta Cell Biology Consortium [1U01DK089570-01]; Marie Curie IEF fellowship; Medical Research Council [MR/L02036X/1]; Novo Nordisk Fonden [NNF15CC0018344],"This work was funded by the Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne (www.epfl.ch), the Novo Nordisk Foundation (www.novonordiskfonden.dk), and the NIDDK Beta Cell Biology Consortium Grant 1U01DK089570-01 (www.betacell.org).

He used it to show that sterile castes could evolve via kin selection, in which a gene for altruistic sterility is favored when the altruism sufficiently benefits relatives carrying the gene. Inclusive fitness theory is well supported empirically and has been applied to many other areas, but a recent paper argued that the general method of inclusive fitness was wrong and advocated an alternative population genetic method. The claim of these authors was bolstered by a new model of the evolution of eusociality with novel conclusions that appeared to overturn some major results from inclusive fitness. Here we report an expanded examination of this kind of model for the evolution of eusociality and show that all three of its apparently novel conclusions are essentially false. Contrary to their claims, genetic relatedness is important and causal, workers are agents that can evolve to be in conflict with the queen, and eusociality is not so difficult to evolve. The misleading conclusions all resulted not from incorrect math but from overgeneralizing from narrow assumptions or parameter values. For example, all of their models implicitly assumed high relatedness, but modifying the model to allow lower relatedness shows that relatedness is essential and causal in the evolution of eusociality. Their modeling strategy, properly applied, actually confirms major insights of inclusive fitness studies of kin selection. This broad agreement of different models shows that social evolution theory, rather than being in turmoil, is supported by multiple theoretical approaches. It also suggests that extensive prior work using inclusive fitness, from microbial interactions to human evolution, should be considered robust unless shown otherwise.","[Liao, Xiaoyun] Rice Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Houston, TX 77005 USA; [Rong, Stephen; Queller, David C.] Washington Univ, Dept Biol, St Louis, MO 63130 USA","Liao, XY (reprint author), Rice Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Houston, TX 77005 USA.",queller@wustl.edu,,"Rong, Stephen/0000-0002-6584-1391","US National Science Foundation [IOS-1256416, DEB-1146375]; John Templeton Foundation [43667]; Wray-Todd fellowship","This material is based upon work supported by the US National Science Foundation under grant nos.

In a forward mosaic screen in Drosophila designed to identify genes required for neuronal function and maintenance, we identified multiple cacophony (cac) mutant alleles. They exhibit an age-dependent accumulation of autophagic vacuoles (AVs) in photoreceptor terminals and eventually a degeneration of the terminals and surrounding glia. cac encodes an alpha 1 subunit of a Drosophila voltage-gated calcium channel (VGCC) that is required for synaptic vesicle fusion with the plasma membrane and neurotransmitter release. Here, we show that cac mutant photoreceptor terminals accumulate AV-lysosomal fusion intermediates, suggesting that Cac is necessary for the fusion of AVs with lysosomes, a poorly defined process. Loss of another subunit of the VGCC, alpha 2 delta or straightjacket (stj), causes phenotypes very similar to those caused by the loss of cac, indicating that the VGCC is required for AV-lysosomal fusion. The role of VGCC in AV-lysosomal fusion is evolutionarily conserved, as the loss of the mouse homologues, Cacna1a and Cacna2d2, also leads to autophagic defects in mice. Moreover, we find that CACNA1A is localized to the lysosomes and that loss of lysosomal Cacna1a in cerebellar cultured neurons leads to a failure of lysosomes to fuse with endosomes and autophagosomes. Finally, we show that the lysosomal CACNA1A but not the plasma-membrane resident CACNA1A is required for lysosomal fusion. In summary, we present a model in which the VGCC plays a role in autophagy by regulating the fusion of AVs with lysosomes through its calcium channel activity and hence functions in maintaining neuronal homeostasis.","[Tian, Xuejun; Zhang, Yongping; Shang, Weina; Fan, Hengyu; Tong, Chao] Zhejiang Univ, Inst Life Sci, Hangzhou 310003, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Tian, Xuejun; Zhang, Yongping; Shang, Weina; Fan, Hengyu; Tong, Chao] Zhejiang Univ, Innovat Ctr Cell Biol, Hangzhou 310003, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Gala, Upasana; Yamamoto, Shinya; Sardiello, Marco; Venkatachalam, Kartik; Bellen, Hugo J.] Baylor Coll Med, Program Dev Biol, Houston, TX 77030 USA; [Jaiswal, Sonal Nagarkar; di Ronza, Alberto; Jaiswal, Manish; Yamamoto, Shinya; Sandoval, Hector; Sardiello, Marco; Bellen, Hugo J.] Baylor Coll Med, Dept Mol & Human Genet, Houston, TX 77030 USA; [di Ronza, Alberto; Yamamoto, Shinya; Sandoval, Hector; Sardiello, Marco; Sillitoe, Roy V.; Bellen, Hugo J.] Texas Childrens Hosp, Jan & Dan Duncan Neurol Res Inst, Houston, TX 77030 USA; [Jaiswal, Manish; Duraine, Lita; Bellen, Hugo J.] Baylor Coll Med, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Houston, TX 77030 USA; [Sillitoe, Roy V.] Baylor Coll Med, Dept Neurosci, Dept Pathol & Immunol, Houston, TX 77030 USA; [Venkatachalam, Kartik] Univ Texas Sch Med, Dept Integrat Biol & Pharmacol, Houston, TX USA; [Bellen, Hugo J.] Baylor Coll Med, Dept Neurosci, Houston, TX 77030 USA","Tian, XJ (reprint author), Zhejiang Univ, Inst Life Sci, Hangzhou 310003, Zhejiang, Peoples R China.",hbellen@bcm.edu; ctong@zju.edu.cn,,"Sandoval, Hector/0000-0002-9186-7384; Jaiswal, Manish/0000-0001-8360-8289; Tong, Chao/0000-0001-6521-5465; Yamamoto, Shinya/0000-0003-2172-8036; Bellen, Hugo/0000-0001-5992-5989","National Natural Science Foundation of China [31271432]; National Basic Research Program of China [2012CB966600, 2014CB943100]; Specialized Research Fund for the Doctoral Program of Higher Education [20130101110116]; Robert A. and Renee E.

The HET-s beta-solenoid prion fold serves as a template for converting the HET-S prion-forming domain into the same fold. This conversion, in turn, activates the HET-S pore-forming domain. The gene immediately adjacent to het-S encodes NWD2, a Nod-like receptor (NLR) with an N-terminal motif similar to the elementary repeat unit of the beta-solenoid fold. NLRs are immune receptors controlling cell death and host defense processes in animals, plants and fungi. We have proposed that, analogously to [Het-s], NWD2 can activate the HET-S pore-forming protein by converting its prion-forming region into the beta-solenoid fold. Here, we analyze the ability of NWD2 to induce formation of the beta-solenoid prion fold. We show that artificial NWD2 variants induce formation of the [Het-s] prion, specifically in presence of their cognate ligands. The N-terminal motif is responsible for this prion induction, and mutations predicted to affect the beta-solenoid fold abolish templating activity. In vitro, the N-terminal motif assembles into infectious prion amyloids that display a structure resembling the beta-solenoid fold. In vivo, the assembled form of the NWD2 N-terminal region activates the HET-S pore-forming protein. This study documenting the role of the beta-solenoid fold in fungal NLR function further highlights the general importance of amyloid and prion-like signaling in immunity-related cell fate pathways.","[Daskalov, Asen; Saupe, Sven J.] Univ Bordeaux, Nonself Recognit Fungi, Inst Biochimi & Genet Cellulaire, CNRS,UMR 5095, Bordeaux, France; [Habenstein, Birgit; Martinez, Denis; Loquet, Antoine] CNRS, CBMN, UMR 5248, Inst Chem & Biol Membranes & Nanoobjects, Pessac, France; [Debets, Alfons J.

The phenotypic effect of symbionts on their hosts may include changes in development, reproduction, longevity, and defense against natural enemies. Determining the consequences of associating with a microbial symbiont requires experimental comparison of hosts with and without symbionts. Then, determining the mechanism by which symbionts alter these phenotypes can involve genomic, genetic, and evolutionary approaches; however, many host-associated symbionts are not amenable to genetic approaches that require cultivation of the microbe outside the host. In the current issue of PLOS Biology, Chrostek and Teixeira highlight an elegant approach to studying functional mechanisms of symbiont-conferred traits. They used directed experimental evolution to select for strains of Wolbachia wMelPop (a bacterial symbiont of fruit flies) that differed in copy number of a region of the genome suspected to underlie virulence. Copy number evolved rapidly when under selection, and wMelPop strains with more copies of the region shortened the lives of their Drosophila hosts more than symbionts with fewer copies. Interestingly, the wMelPop strains with more copies also increase host resistance to viruses compared to symbionts with fewer copies. Their study highlights the power of exploiting alternative approaches when elucidating the functional impacts of symbiotic associations.","Emory Univ, Dept Biol, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA","Gerardo, NM (reprint author), Emory Univ, Dept Biol, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA.",Nicole.gerardo@emory.edu,,,,,,33,5,5,0,24,PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE,SAN FRANCISCO,"1160 BATTERY STREET, STE 100, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94111 USA",1545-7885,,,PLOS BIOL,PLoS.

Establishing appropriate levels of TGF beta signalling involves positive and negative feedback, which are coupled and driven by the same signal transduction components (R-Smad transcription factor complexes), but whether and how the regulation of the two can be distinguished are unknown. Genome-wide comparison of published ChIP-seq datasets suggests that LIM domain binding proteins (Ldbs) co-localise with R-Smads at a substantial subset of R-Smad target genes including the locus of inhibitory Smad7 (I-Smad7), which mediates negative feedback for TGF beta signalling. We present evidence suggesting that zebrafish Ldb2a binds and directly activates the I-Smad7 gene, whereas it binds and represses the ligand gene, Squint (Sqt), which drives positive feedback. Thus, the fine tuning of TGF beta signalling derives from positive and negative control by Ldb2a. Expression of ldb2a is itself activated by TGF beta signals, suggesting potential feed-forward loops that might delay the negative input of Ldb2a to the positive feedback, as well as the positive input of Ldb2a to the negative feedback. In this way, precise gene expression control by Ldb2a enables an initial build-up of signalling via a fully active positive feedback in the absence of buffering by the negative feedback. In Ldb2a-deficient zebrafish embryos, homeostasis of TGF beta signalling is perturbed and signalling is stably enhanced, giving rise to excess mesoderm and endoderm, an effect that can be rescued by reducing signalling by the TGF beta family members, Nodal and BMP. Thus, Ldb2a is critical to the homeostatic control of TGF beta signalling and thereby embryonic patterning.","[Gu, Wenchao; Monteiro, Rui; Zuo, Jie; Sauka-Spengler, Tatjana; Patient, Roger] Univ Oxford, John Radcliffe Hosp, Weatherall Inst Mol Med, Oxford OX3 9DU, England; [Monteiro, Rui; Patient, Roger] BHF Ctr Res Excellence, Oxford, England; [Simoes, Filipa Costa] Univ Oxford, Dept Physiol Anat & Genet, Oxford, England; [Martella, Andrea; Grosveld, Frank] Erasmus MC, Dept Cell Biol, Rotterdam, Netherlands; [Andrieu-Soler, Charlotte] Univ Paris 05, Sorbonne Paris Cite, INSERM U872, Team 17,Ctr Rech Cordeliers, Paris, France","Gu, WC (reprint author), Univ Oxford, John Radcliffe Hosp, Weatherall Inst Mol Med, Oxford OX3 9DU, England.",roger.patient@imm.ox.ac.uk,"Monteiro, Rui/J-2544-2013","Monteiro, Rui/0000-0002-4223-8506; Sauka-Spengler, Tatjana/0000-0001-9289-0263; Simoes, Filipa/0000-0003-2956-0311","Medical Research Council (MRC, UK); British Heart Foundation (BHF, UK); Center for Biomedical Genetics (NL); NIRM consortium (NL); EU; Oxford Cancer Research Centre (OCRC); British Heart Foundation [FS/13/50/30436, PG/09/082/28020]; Medical Research Council [G1000801a, MC_U137981013, MC_UU_12009/8, G0902418]","This work was supported by the Medical Research Council (MRC, UK), the British Heart Foundation (BHF, UK), the Center for Biomedical Genetics (NL) and the NIRM consortium (NL), the EU integrated project EuTRACC and the Oxford Cancer Research Centre (OCRC).

Yet, the transport mechanism for plastid fatty acids still remains enigmatic. We isolated FAX1 (fatty acid export 1), a novel protein, which inserts into the chloroplast inner envelope by alpha-helical membrane-spanning domains. Detailed phenotypic and ultrastructural analyses of FAX1 mutants in Arabidopsis thaliana showed that FAX1 function is crucial for biomass production, male fertility and synthesis of fatty acid-derived compounds such as lipids, ketone waxes, or pollen cell wall material. Determination of lipid, fatty acid, and wax contents by mass spectrometry revealed that endoplasmatic reticulum (ER)-derived lipids decreased when FAX1 was missing, but levels of several plastid-produced species increased. FAX1 over-expressing lines showed the opposite behavior, including a pronounced increase of triacyglycerol oils in flowers and leaves. Furthermore, the cuticular layer of stems from fax1 knockout lines was specifically reduced in C29 ketone wax compounds. Differential gene expression in FAX1 mutants as determined by DNA microarray analysis confirmed phenotypes and metabolic imbalances. Since in yeast FAX1 could complement for fatty acid transport, we concluded that FAX1 mediates fatty acid export from plastids. In vertebrates, FAX1 relatives are structurally related, mitochondrial membrane proteins of so-far unknown function. Therefore, this protein family might represent a powerful tool not only to increase lipid/biofuel production in plants but also to explore novel transport systems involved in vertebrate fatty acid and lipid metabolism.","[Li, Nannan; Guegel, Irene Luise; Soll, Juergen; Philippar, Katrin] Ludwig Maximilians Univ Munchen, Dept Biol Bot 1, Biochem & Physiol Pflanzen, Planegg Martinsried, Germany; [Li, Nannan] Southwest Univ, Coll Resources & Environm, RCBB, Chongqing, Peoples R China; [Guegel, Irene Luise; Soll, Juergen; Philippar, Katrin] Univ Munich, CIPSM, Munich, Germany; [Giavalisco, Patrick] MPIMP, Potsdam, Germany; [Zeisler, Viktoria; Schreiber, Lukas] Univ Bonn, Dept Ecophysiol, Inst Cellular & Mol Bot, Bonn, Germany","Li, N (reprint author), Ludwig Maximilians Univ Munchen, Dept Biol Bot 1, Biochem & Physiol Pflanzen, Planegg Martinsried, Germany.",philippar@lmu.de,"Philippar, Katrin/F-7942-2018","Philippar, Katrin/0000-0002-2140-4907",China Scholarship Council (CSC); Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG),"NL's doctoral studies at the LMU Munich were supported by the China Scholarship Council (CSC).

While multipotent basal stem cells have been found within the myoepithelial compartment, the in vivo lineage potential of luminal progenitors is unclear. Here we used the expression of the Notch1 receptor, previously implicated in mammary gland development and tumorigenesis, to elucidate the hierarchical organization of mammary stem/progenitor cells by lineage tracing. We found that Notch1 expression identifies multipotent stem cells in the embryonic mammary bud, which progressively restrict their lineage potential during mammary ductal morphogenesis to exclusively generate an ER alpha(neg) luminal lineage postnatally. Importantly, our results show that Notch1-labelled cells represent the alveolar progenitors that expand during pregnancy and survive multiple successive involutions. This study reveals that postnatal luminal epithelial cells derive from distinct self-sustained lineages that may represent the cells of origin of different breast cancer subtypes.","[Rodilla, Veronica; Dasti, Alessandro; Huyghe, Mathilde; Lafkas, Daniel; Fre, Silvia] Inst Curie, Dept Genet & Dev Biol, Paris, France; [Rodilla, Veronica; Dasti, Alessandro; Huyghe, Mathilde; Lafkas, Daniel; Fre, Silvia] CNRS, UMR3215, Paris, France; [Rodilla, Veronica; Dasti, Alessandro; Huyghe, Mathilde; Lafkas, Daniel; Fre, Silvia] INSERM, U934, Paris, France; [Laurent, Cecile; Reyal, Fabien] Inst Curie, Dept Translat Res, Paris, France; [Reyal, Fabien] Inst Curie, Dept Surg, Paris, France","Rodilla, V (reprint author), Inst Curie, Dept Genet & Dev Biol, Paris, France.",silvia.fre@curie.fr,"BENITO, VERONICA RODILLA/A-5171-2018; Fre, Silvia/C-7540-2017","BENITO, VERONICA RODILLA/0000-0003-0512-4179; Fre, Silvia/0000-0002-7209-7636; Lafkas, Daniel/0000-0001-7395-476X","Association pour la Recherche contre le Cancer [SFI20111203777, PDF20111204419]; Ligue contre le Cancer [RS14/75-87]; Labex DEEP ANR [11-LBX-0044]","This work was in part supported by the Association pour la Recherche contre le Cancer, grant Number SFI20111203777 (http://www.recherche-cancer.net/), the Ligue contre le Cancer, grant Number RS14/75-87 (http://www.ligue-cancer.net/) and by Labex DEEP ANR-Number 11-LBX-0044 (http://www.labex-deep.fr/?lang = en) to SF.

Thus, perception inherently relies on solving the ""causal inference problem."" Behaviorally, humans solve this problem optimally as predicted by Bayesian Causal Inference; yet, the underlying neural mechanisms are unexplored. Combining psychophysics, Bayesian modeling, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), and multivariate decoding in an audiovisual spatial localization task, we demonstrate that Bayesian Causal Inference is performed by a hierarchy of multisensory processes in the human brain. At the bottom of the hierarchy, in auditory and visual areas, location is represented on the basis that the two signals are generated by independent sources (= segregation). At the next stage, in posterior intraparietal sulcus, location is estimated under the assumption that the two signals are from a common source (= forced fusion). Only at the top of the hierarchy, in anterior intraparietal sulcus, the uncertainty about the causal structure of the world is taken into account and sensory signals are combined as predicted by Bayesian Causal Inference. Characterizing the computational operations of signal interactions reveals the hierarchical nature of multisensory perception in human neocortex. It unravels how the brain accomplishes Bayesian Causal Inference, a statistical computation fundamental for perception and cognition. Our results demonstrate how the brain combines information in the face of uncertainty about the underlying causal structure of the world.","[Rohe, Tim; Noppeney, Uta] Max Planck Inst Biol Cybernet, Tubingen, Germany; [Noppeney, Uta] Univ Birmingham, Computat Neurosci & Cognit Robot Ctr, Birmingham, W Midlands, England","Rohe, T (reprint author), Max Planck Inst Biol Cybernet, Tubingen, Germany.",tim.rohe@tuebingen.mpg.de; U.noppeney@bham.ac.uk,,"Noppeney, Uta/0000-0002-7697-2290",Max Planck Society; European Research Council (ERC-StG-MultSens); Medical Research Council [MR/K00414X/1],"This work was funded by the Max Planck Society and the European Research Council (ERC-StG-MultSens).

Based on classical studies in molecular biology, many have viewed microbes as following strict rules for shifting their metabolic activities when prevailing conditions change. For example, students learn that the bacterium Escherichia coli makes proteins for digesting lactose only when lactose is available and glucose, a better sugar, is not. However, recent studies, including three PLOS Biology papers examining sugar utilization in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, show that considerable heterogeneity in response to complex environments exists within and between populations. These results join similar recent results in other organisms that suggest that microbial populations anticipate predictable environmental changes and hedge their bets against unpredictable ones. The classical view therefore represents but one special case in a range of evolutionary adaptations to environmental changes that all organisms face.","NYU, Dept Biol, Ctr Genom & Syst Biol, New York, NY 10003 USA","Siegal, ML (reprint author), NYU, Dept Biol, Ctr Genom & Syst Biol, New York, NY 10003 USA.",mark.siegal@nyu.edu,,"Siegal, Mark/0000-0001-6930-2988",,,,25,7,7,2,19,PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE,SAN FRANCISCO,"1160 BATTERY STREET, STE 100, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94111 USA",1545-7885,,,PLOS BIOL,PLoS.

As a result, the neurons in a deprived column simultaneously increase and decrease their responses to spared and deprived inputs, respectively. Previous studies revealed that dendritic spines are remodeled during this barrel map plasticity. Because cofilin1, a predominant regulator of actin filament turnover, governs both the expansion and shrinkage of the dendritic spine structure in vitro, it hypothetically regulates both responses in barrel map plasticity. However, this hypothesis remains untested. Using lentiviral vectors, we knocked down cofilin1 locally within layer 2/3 neurons in a deprived column. Cofilin1-knocked-down neurons were optogenetically labeled using channelrhodopsin-2, and electrophysiological recordings were targeted to these knocked-down neurons. We showed that cofilin1 knockdown impaired response increases to spared inputs but preserved response decreases to deprived inputs, indicating that cofilin1 dependency is dissociated in these two types of barrel map plasticity. To explore the structural basis of this dissociation, we then analyzed spine densities on deprived column dendritic branches, which were supposed to receive dense horizontal transcolumnar projections from the spared column. We found that spine number increased in a cofilin1-dependent manner selectively in the distal part of the supragranular layer, where most of the transcolumnar projections existed. Our findings suggest that cofilin1-mediated actin dynamics regulate functional map plasticity in an input-specific manner through the dendritic spine remodeling that occurs in the horizontal transcolumnar circuits. These new mechanistic insights into transcolumnar plasticity in adult rats may have a general significance for understanding reorganization of neocortical circuits that have more sophisticated columnar organization than the rodent neocortex, such as the primate neocortex.","[Tsubota, Tadashi; Ohashi, Yohei; Tamura, Keita; Ogata, Koshin; Yaguchi, Masae; Matsuyama, Makoto; Miyashita, Yasushi] Univ Tokyo, Sch Med, Dept Physiol, Tokyo 113, Japan; [Okubo-Suzuki, Reiko; Inokuchi, Kaoru] Toyama Univ, Grad Sch Med & Pharmaceut Sci, Dept Biochem, Toyama 930, Japan; [Okubo-Suzuki, Reiko; Inokuchi, Kaoru; Miyashita, Yasushi] Japan Sci & Technol Agcy JST, CREST, Saitama, Japan","Tsubota, T (reprint author), Univ Tokyo, Sch Med, Dept Physiol, Tokyo 113, Japan.",yasushi_miyashita@m.u-tokyo.ac.jp,"Tamura, Keita/I-2931-2012; Miyashita, Yasushi/B-7171-2019","Tamura, Keita/0000-0003-2697-1510; Miyashita, Yasushi/0000-0003-3496-8637; Inokuchi, Kaoru/0000-0002-5393-3133","Core Research for Evolutional Science and Technology (CREST) program of the Japan Science and Technology Agency; Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology (MEXT); JSPS [23220009, 19002010, 24220008]; MEXT [23700489]; Takeda Science Foundation; Uehara Memorial Fund; JSPS Research Fellowships for Young Scientists [235569]","This work was supported by a grant from Core Research for Evolutional Science and Technology (CREST) program of the Japan Science and Technology Agency (KI, YM) (http://www.jst.go.jp/), a grant from Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology (MEXT) (http://www.mext.go.jp/) and JSPS (http://www.jsps.go.jp/) (grant number 23220009 to KI, 19002010 to YM, and 24220008 to YM), MEXT Grant-in-Aid Scientific Research on Innovative Areas (KI), a grant from Takeda Science Foundation (KI, YM) (http://www.takeda-sci.or.jp/), a Grant-in-Aid for Young Scientists from MEXT (grant number, 23700489; YO), Uehara Memorial Fund (YO) (http://www.ueharazaidan.or.jp/), and JSPS Research Fellowships for Young Scientists (grant number, 235569; TT).

Here, we analyze expression of environmentally responsive genes and transcription factor genes to infer signals and pathways that drive pathogen gene regulation during invasive Candida albicans infection of a mammalian host. Environmentally responsive gene expression shows that there are early and late phases of infection. The early phase includes induction of zinc and iron limitation genes, genes that respond to transcription factor Rim101, and genes characteristic of invasive hyphal cells. The late phase includes responses related to phagocytosis by macrophages. Transcription factor gene expression also reflects early and late phases. Transcription factor genes that are required for virulence or proliferation in vivo are enriched among highly expressed transcription factor genes. Mutants defective in six transcription factor genes, three previously studied in detail (Rim101, Efg1, Zap1) and three less extensively studied (Rob1, Rpn4, Sut1), are profiled during infection. Most of these mutants have distinct gene expression profiles during infection as compared to in vitro growth. Infection profiles suggest that Sut1 acts in the same pathway as Zap1, and we verify that functional relationship with the finding that overexpression of either ZAP1 or the Zap1-dependent zinc transporter gene ZRT2 restores pathogenicity to a sut1 mutant. Perturbation with the cell wall inhibitor caspofungin also has distinct gene expression impact in vivo and in vitro. Unexpectedly, caspofungin induces many of the same genes that are repressed early during infection, a phenomenon that we suggest may contribute to drug efficacy. The pathogen response circuitry is tailored uniquely during infection, with many relevant regulatory relationships that are not evident during growth in vitro. Our findings support the principle that virulence is a property that is manifested only in the distinct environment in which host-pathogen interaction occurs.","[Xu, Wenjie; Ehrlich, Rachel L.; Woolford, Carol A.; Mitchell, Aaron P.] Carnegie Mellon Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA; [Solis, Norma V.; Filler, Scott G.] Harbor UCLA Med Ctr, Los Angeles Biomed Res Inst, Div Infect Dis, Torrance, CA 90509 USA","Xu, WJ (reprint author), Carnegie Mellon Univ, Dept Biol Sci, 4400 5th Ave, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA.",sfiller@ucla.edu; apm1@cmu.edu,,"Mitchell, Aaron/0000-0002-0868-4000; Woolford, Carol/0000-0001-6261-3468","NIH [R21 DE023311, R01AI054928]","This work was supported in part by NIH grants R21 DE023311 (APM) and R01AI054928 (SGF) and a gift from the Richard King Mellon Foundation (APM).

To address this, we compiled a globally-representative database of visits to PAs and built region-specific models predicting visit rates from PA size, local population size, remoteness, natural attractiveness, and national income. Applying these models to all but the very smallest of the world's terrestrial PAs suggests that together they receive roughly 8 billion (8 x 109) visits/y-of which more than 80% are in Europe and North America. Linking our region-specific visit estimates to valuation studies indicates that these visits generate approximately US $600 billion/y in direct in-country expenditure and US $250 billion/y in consumer surplus. These figures dwarf current, typically inadequate spending on conserving PAs. Thus, even without considering the many other ecosystem services that PAs provide to people, our findings underscore calls for greatly increased investment in their conservation.","[Balmford, Andrew; Green, Jonathan M.

Because of the mode of transmission, the fitness of these symbionts is dependent on the fitness of the hosts. Therefore, these endosymbionts need to control their proliferation in order to minimize their cost for the host. The genetic bases and mechanisms of this regulation remain largely undetermined. The maternally inherited bacteria of the genus Wolbachia are the most common endosymbionts of insects, providing some of them with fitness benefits. In Drosophila melanogaster, Wolbachia wMelPop is a unique virulent variant that proliferates massively in the hosts and shortens their lifespan. The genetic bases of wMelPop virulence are unknown, and their identification would allow a better understanding of how Wolbachia levels are regulated. Here we show that amplification of a region containing eight Wolbachia genes, called Octomom, is responsible for wMelPop virulence. Using Drosophila lines selected for carrying Wolbachia with different Octomom copy numbers, we demonstrate that the number of Octomom copies determines Wolbachia titers and the strength of the lethal phenotype. Octomom amplification is unstable, and reversion of copy number to one reverts all the phenotypes. Our results provide a link between genotype and phenotype in Wolbachia and identify a genomic region regulating Wolbachia proliferation. We also prove that these bacteria can evolve rapidly. Rapid evolution by changes in gene copy number may be common in endosymbionts with a high number of mobile elements and other repeated regions. Understanding wMelPop pathogenicity and variability also allows researchers to better control and predict the outcome of releasing mosquitoes transinfected with this variant to block human vector-borne diseases. Our results show that transition from a mutualist to a pathogen may occur because of a single genomic change in the endosymbiont. This implies that there must be constant selection on endosymbionts to control their densities.","[Chrostek, Ewa; Teixeira, Luis] Inst Gulbenkian Ciencias, Oeiras, Portugal","Chrostek, E (reprint author), Inst Gulbenkian Ciencias, Oeiras, Portugal.",e.chrostek@gmail.com; lteixeira@igc.gulbenkian.pt,"Teixeira, Luis/H-6106-2013","Teixeira, Luis/0000-0001-8326-6645; Chrostek, Ewa/0000-0003-1825-372X","Fundacao para a Ciencia e Tecnologia [PTDC/SAU-MII/105655/2008, SFRH/BD/51625/2011]; Wellcome Trust [094664/Z/10/Z]","Fundacao para a Ciencia e Tecnologia (http://www.fct.pt) grant PTDC/SAU-MII/105655/2008 and the Wellcome Trust (http://www.wellcome.ac.uk) grant 094664/Z/10/Z.

In deciphering this array of sensory information, the brain has to solve two problems: (1) which of the inputs originate from the same object and should be integrated and (2) for the sensations originating from the same object, how best to integrate them. Recent behavioural studies suggest that the human brain solves these problems using optimal probabilistic inference, known as Bayesian causal inference. However, how and where the underlying computations are carried out in the brain have remained unknown. By combining neuroimaging-based decoding techniques and computational modelling of behavioural data, a new study now sheds light on how multisensory causal inference maps onto specific brain areas. The results suggest that the complexity of neural computations increases along the visual hierarchy and link specific components of the causal inference process with specific visual and parietal regions.","[Kayser, Christoph] Univ Glasgow, Inst Neurosci & Psychol, Glasgow, Lanark, Scotland; [Shams, Ladan] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Psychol, Los Angeles, CA 90024 USA; [Shams, Ladan] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Bioengn, Los Angeles, CA USA; [Shams, Ladan] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Interdept Neurosci Program, Los Angeles, CA USA","Kayser, C (reprint author), Univ Glasgow, Inst Neurosci & Psychol, Glasgow, Lanark, Scotland.",christoph.kayser@glasgow.ac.uk,"Kayser, Christoph/A-3203-2012","Kayser, Christoph/0000-0001-7362-5704",Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council [BB/L027534/1],,,30,26,26,1,17,PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE,SAN FRANCISCO,"1160 BATTERY STREET, STE 100, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94111 USA",1545-7885,,,PLOS BIOL,PLoS.

Soluble monomers assemble into large transmembrane pores via conformational transitions that remain to be structurally and mechanistically characterised. Here we present an 11 angstrom resolution cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of the two-part, fungal toxin Pleurotolysin (Ply), together with crystal structures of both components (the lipid binding PlyA protein and the pore-forming MACPF component PlyB). These data reveal a 13-fold pore 80 angstrom in diameter and 100 angstrom in height, with each subunit comprised of a PlyB molecule atop a membrane bound dimer of PlyA. The resolution of the EM map, together with biophysical and computational experiments, allowed confident assignment of subdomains in a MACPF pore assembly. The major conformational changes in PlyB are a similar to 70 degrees opening of the bent and distorted central beta-sheet of the MACPF domain, accompanied by extrusion and refolding of two a-helical regions into transmembrane beta-hairpins (TMH1 and TMH2). We determined the structures of three different disulphide bond-trapped prepore intermediates. Analysis of these data by molecular modelling and flexible fitting allows us to generate a potential trajectory of beta-sheet unbending. The results suggest that MACPF conformational change is triggered through disruption of the interface between a conserved helix-turn-helix motif and the top of TMH2. Following their release we propose that the transmembrane regions assemble into beta-hairpins via top down zippering of backbone hydrogen bonds to form the membrane-inserted beta-barrel. The intermediate structures of the MACPF domain during refolding into the beta-barrel pore establish a structural paradigm for the transition from soluble monomer to pore, which may be conserved across the whole superfamily. The TMH2 region is critical for the release of both TMH clusters, suggesting why this region is targeted by endogenous inhibitors of MACPF function.","[Lukoyanova, Natalya; Farabella, Irene; Topf, Maya; Saibil, Helen R.] Univ London Birkbeck Coll, Inst Struct & Mol Biol, Dept Crystallog Biol Sci, London WC1E 7HX, England; [Kondos, Stephanie C.; Law, Ruby H.

The goal of the current study was to examine the effective connectivity of subsectors of neurons in the same cortical area with highly similar neuronal response properties. We first recorded single-and multi-unit activity to identify two neuronal patches in the anterior part of the macaque intraparietal sulcus (IPS) showing the same depth structure selectivity and then employed electrical microstimulation during functional magnetic resonance imaging in these patches to determine the effective connectivity of these patches. The two IPS subsectors we identified-with the same neuronal response properties and in some cases separated by only 3 mm-were effectively connected to remarkably distinct cortical networks in both dorsal and ventral stream in three macaques. Conversely, the differences in effective connectivity could account for the known visual-to-motor gradient within the anterior IPS. These results clarify the role of the anterior IPS as a pivotal brain region where dorsal and ventral visual stream interact during object analysis. Thus, in addition to the anatomical connectivity of cortical areas and the properties of individual neurons in these areas, the effective connectivity provides novel key insights into the widespread functional networks that support behavior.","[Premereur, Elsie; Van Dromme, Ilse C.; Romero, Maria C.; Vanduffel, Wim; Janssen, Peter] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Lab Neuro & Psychofysiol, Leuven, Belgium; [Vanduffel, Wim] Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Athinoula A Martinos Ctr Biomed Imaging, Charlestown, MA USA; [Vanduffel, Wim] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Radiol, Boston, MA 02115 USA","Premereur, E (reprint author), Katholieke Univ Leuven, Lab Neuro & Psychofysiol, Leuven, Belgium.",Peter.Janssen@med.kuleuven.be,,,"geconcerteerde onderzoeksacties [GOA/10/19]; interuniversity attraction poles IUAP [VII/11]; National Science Foundation NSF [BCS-0745436]; Fonds Wetenschappelijk onderzoek FWO [G.0713.09, G.0622.08, G.0831.11]; European Research Council ERC [Stg-260607]; Odysseus grant [G.0007.12];  [PFV/10/008]","PJ and WV received funding from geconcerteerde onderzoeksacties GOA/10/19; http://www.kuleuven.be/onderzoek/kernprojecten/goa.htm.

Binding of the U3 box A region to the pre-rRNA is mutually exclusive with folding of the central pseudoknot (CPK), a universally conserved rRNA structure of the small ribosomal subunit essential for protein synthesis. Here, we report that the DEAH-box helicase Dhr1 (Ecm16) is responsible for displacing U3. An active site mutant of Dhr1 blocked release of U3 from the pre-ribosome, thereby trapping a pre-40S particle. This particle had not yet achieved its mature structure because it contained U3, pre-rRNA, and a number of early-acting ribosome synthesis factors but noticeably lacked ribosomal proteins (r-proteins) that surround the CPK. Dhr1 was cross-linked in vivo to the pre-rRNA and to U3 sequences flanking regions that base-pair to the pre-rRNA including those that form the CPK. Point mutations in the box A region of U3 suppressed a cold-sensitive mutation of Dhr1, strongly indicating that U3 is an in vivo substrate of Dhr1. To support the conclusions derived from in vivo analysis we showed that Dhr1 unwinds U3-18S duplexes in vitro by using a mechanism reminiscent of DEAD box proteins.","[Sardana, Richa; Zhu, Jieyi; Gill, Michael; Papoulas, Ophelia; Marcotte, Edward M.; Johnson, Arlen W.] Univ Texas Austin, Dept Mol Biosci, Austin, TX 78712 USA; [Sardana, Richa; Zhu, Jieyi; Gill, Michael; Papoulas, Ophelia; Marcotte, Edward M.; Johnson, Arlen W.] Univ Texas Austin, Inst Cellular & Mol Biol, Austin, TX 78712 USA; [Liu, Xin; Correll, Carl C.] Rosalind Franklin Univ Med & Sci, Dept Biochem & Mol Biol, N Chicago, IL USA; [Granneman, Sander; Tollervey, David] Univ Edinburgh, Wellcome Trust Ctr Cell Biol, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland","Sardana, R (reprint author), Univ Texas Austin, Dept Mol Biosci, Austin, TX 78712 USA.",carl.correll@rosalindfranklin.edu; arlen@austin.utexas.edu,"; Granneman, Sander/A-3150-2015","Tollervey, David/0000-0003-2894-2772; Marcotte, Edward/0000-0001-8808-180X; Granneman, Sander/0000-0003-4387-1271","National Institutes of Health [GM053655, GM108823]; National Science Foundation; Cancer Prevention and Research Institute of Texas; Welch Foundation [F1515]; Wellcome Trust [077248]; Wellcome Trust Research and Career Development Grant [091549]; Wellcome Trust Centre for Cell Biology [092076]; UT Austin","This work was supported by National Institutes of Health (http://www.nih.gov/) grants GM053655 and GM108823 to AWJ, grants from National Institutes of Health, National Science Foundation, Cancer Prevention and Research Institute of Texas (http://www.cprit.state.tx.us/), and the Welch Foundation (http://www.welch1.org/) (F1515) to EMM, Wellcome Trust (http://www.wellcome.ac.uk/) (077248) to DT, Wellcome Trust Research and Career Development Grant (091549 to SG), Wellcome Trust Centre for Cell Biology core grant (092076) and a UT Austin (http://www.utexas.edu/) Undergraduate Research Fellowship to MG.

In animals, Piwi interacting small RNAs (piRNAs) are a crucial arm of this defence. However, the evolutionary relationships among piRNAs and other small RNA pathways targeting transposable elements are poorly resolved. To address this question we sequenced small RNAs from multiple, diverse nematode species, producing the first phylum-wide analysis of how small RNA pathways evolve. Surprisingly, despite their prominence in Caenorhabditis elegans and closely related nematodes, piRNAs are absent in all other nematode lineages. We found that there are at least two evolutionarily distinct mechanisms that compensate for the absence of piRNAs, both involving RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RdRPs). Whilst one pathway is unique to nematodes, the second involves Dicer-dependent RNA-directed DNA methylation, hitherto unknown in animals, and bears striking similarity to transposon-control mechanisms in fungi and plants. Our results highlight the rapid, context-dependent evolution of small RNA pathways and suggest piRNAs in animals may have replaced an ancient eukaryotic RNA-dependent RNA polymerase pathway to control transposable elements.","[Sarkies, Peter] Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, MRC Clin Sci Ctr, London, England; [Selkirk, Murray E.] Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Dept Life Sci, London, England; [Jones, John T.; Blok, Vivian] James Hutton Inst, Dundee, Scotland; [Boothby, Thomas; Goldstein, Bob] Univ N Carolina, Dept Biol, Chapel Hill, NC USA; [Hanelt, Ben] Univ New Mexico, Dept Biol, Ctr Evolutionary & Theoret Immunol, Albuquerque, NM 87131 USA; [Ardila-Garcia, Alex; Fast, Naomi M.] Univ British Columbia, Dept Bot, Vancouver, BC, Canada; [Schiffer, Phillip M.; Kraus, Christopher] Univ Cologne, Inst Zool, Cologne, Nrw, Germany; [Taylor, Mark J.] Univ Liverpool, Liverpool Sch Trop Med, Mol & Biochem Parasitol, Liverpool L3 5QA, Merseyside, England; [Koutsovoulos, Georgios; Blaxter, Mark L.] Univ Edinburgh, Inst Evolutionary Biol, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland; [Miska, Eric A.] Wellcome Trust Canc Res UK Gurdon Inst, Cambridge, England","Sarkies, P (reprint author), Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, MRC Clin Sci Ctr, London, England.",psarkies@imperial.ac.uk; eam29@cam.ac.uk,"Blaxter, Mark/B-4113-2010; Blaxter, Mark/O-2535-2019","Blaxter, Mark/0000-0003-2861-949X; Taylor, Mark/0000-0003-3396-9275; Koutsovoulos, Georgios/0000-0003-3406-3715; Sarkies, Peter/0000-0003-0279-6199; Jones, John/0000-0003-2074-0551; Schiffer, Philipp/0000-0001-6776-0934; Selkirk, Murray/0000-0002-6274-6014; Miska, Eric/0000-0002-4450-576X; Goldstein, Bob/0000-0001-6961-675X","Gonville and Caius College Cambridge; Medical Research Council; Cancer Research UK [RG57329]; ERC [RG58558]; Medical Research Council [G0900740, MC_UP_1102/13, MR/K001744/1]; Natural Environment Research Council [NE/J011355/1, NBAF010003]","PS salary was funded by a Research Fellowship from Gonville and Caius College Cambridge and by a Career Development Award from the Medical Research Council.

Starch is composed of glucose polymers that are branched (amylopectin) or linear (amylose). The amount of amylose strongly influences the physico-chemical behaviour of starchy foods during cooking and of starch mixtures in non-food manufacturing processes. The GRANULE-BOUND STARCH SYNTHASE (GBSS) is the glucosyltransferase specifically responsible for elongating amylose polymers and was the only protein known to be required for its biosynthesis. Here, we demonstrate that PROTEIN TARGETING TO STARCH (PTST) is also specifically required for amylose synthesis in Arabidopsis. PTST is a plastidial protein possessing an N-terminal coiled coil domain and a C-terminal carbohydrate binding module (CBM). We discovered that Arabidopsis ptst mutants synthesise amylose-free starch and are phenotypically similar to mutants lacking GBSS. Analysis of granule-bound proteins showed a dramatic reduction of GBSS protein in ptst mutant starch granules. Pull-down assays with recombinant proteins in vitro, as well as immunoprecipitation assays in planta, revealed that GBSS physically interacts with PTST via a coiled coil. Furthermore, we show that the CBM domain of PTST, which mediates its interaction with starch granules, is also required for correct GBSS localisation. Fluorescently tagged Arabidopsis GBSS, expressed either in tobacco or Arabidopsis leaves, required the presence of Arabidopsis PTST to localise to starch granules. Mutation of the CBM of PTST caused GBSS to remain in the plastid stroma. PTST fulfils a previously unknown function in targeting GBSS to starch. This sheds new light on the importance of targeting biosynthetic enzymes to sub-cellular sites where their action is required. Importantly, PTST represents a promising new gene target for the biotechnological modification of starch composition, as it is exclusively involved in amylose synthesis.","[Seung, David; Soyk, Sebastian; Coiro, Mario; Maier, Benjamin A.; Eicke, Simona; Zeeman, Samuel C.] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Inst Agr Sci, Zurich, Switzerland","Seung, D (reprint author), Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Inst Agr Sci, Zurich, Switzerland.",szeeman@ethz.ch,"Coiro, Mario/J-4567-2019; Seung, David/D-8811-2013","Coiro, Mario/0000-0002-0113-0320; Soyk, Sebastian/0000-0003-0325-4404; Zeeman, Samuel/0000-0002-2791-0915; Seung, David/0000-0003-3905-3647",Swiss-South African Joint Research Programme [IZLSZ3 148857/1]; Heinz-Imhof Fellowship from the ETH Foundation; ETH Zurich,"This work was funded by the Swiss-South African Joint Research Programme (Grant Number IZLSZ3 148857/1 to S.C.Z.), by a Heinz-Imhof Fellowship from the ETH Foundation (to D.S.), and by ETH Zurich.

However, it is unknown how flying animals rapidly transform noisy sensory information into adequate motor commands. Here we developed a sensorimotor control model that explains vertebrate flight guidance with high fidelity. This simple model accurately reconstructed complex trajectories of bats flying in the dark. The model implies that in order to apply appropriate motor commands, bats have to estimate not only the angle-to-target, as was previously assumed, but also the angular velocity (""proportional- derivative"" controller). Next, we conducted experiments in which bats flew in light conditions. When using vision, bats altered their movements, reducing the flight curvature. This change was explained by the model via reduction in sensory noise under vision versus pure echolocation. These results imply a surprising link between sensory noise and movement dynamics. We propose that this sensory-motor link is fundamental to motion control in rapidly moving animals under different sensory conditions, on land, sea, or air.","[Bar, Nadav S.; Skogestad, Sigurd] Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol NTNU, Dept Chem Engn, Trondheim, Norway; [Marcal, Jose M.] Univ Lisbon, Inst Telecommun, P-1699 Lisbon, Portugal; [Ulanovsky, Nachum] Weizmann Inst Sci, Dept Neurobiol, IL-76100 Rehovot, Israel; [Yovel, Yossi] Tel Aviv Univ, Dept Zool, Fac Life Sci, IL-69978 Tel Aviv, Israel; [Yovel, Yossi] Tel Aviv Univ, Sagol Sch Neurosci, IL-69978 Tel Aviv, Israel","Bar, NS (reprint author), Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol NTNU, Dept Chem Engn, Trondheim, Norway.",nadi.bar@ntnu.no; yossiyovel@hotmail.com,,"Yovel, Yossi/0000-0001-5429-9245","Human Frontier Science Program (HFSP) [RGP0040/2013, RGP0062/2009]; Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU)","This work was supported by the Human Frontier Science Program (HFSP grant no.

In the context of the ongoing Ebola virus disease (EVD) epidemic in Liberia, Drake and colleagues, in this issue of PLOS Biology, employed an elegant modeling approach to capture the distributions of the number of secondary cases that arise in the community and health care settings in the context of changing population behaviors and increasing hospital capacity. Their findings underscore the role of increasing the rate of safe burials and the fractions of infectious individuals who seek hospitalization together with hospital capacity to achieve epidemic control. However, further modeling efforts of EVD transmission and control in West Africa should utilize the spatial-temporal patterns of spread in the region by incorporating spatial heterogeneity in the transmission process. Detailed datasets are urgently needed to characterize temporal changes in population behaviors, contact networks at different spatial scales, population mobility patterns, adherence to infection control measures in hospital settings, and hospitalization and reporting rates.","[Chowell, Gerardo] Georgia State Univ, Sch Publ Hlth, Atlanta, GA 30303 USA; [Chowell, Gerardo] NIH, Div Int Epidemiol & Populat Studies, Fogarty Int Ctr, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; [Chowell, Gerardo] Arizona State Univ, Sch Human Evolut & Social Change, Tempe, AZ USA; [Nishiura, Hiroshi] Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Med, Dept Global Hlth Policy, Tokyo, Japan; [Nishiura, Hiroshi] Japan Sci & Technol Agcy, CREST, Kawaguchi, Saitama, Japan","Chowell, G (reprint author), Georgia State Univ, Sch Publ Hlth, Atlanta, GA 30303 USA.",gchowell@gsu.edu,,"Nishiura, Hiroshi/0000-0003-0941-8537; Simonsen, Lone/0000-0003-1535-8526","NSF [1414374, 1318788 III]; NSF-NIH-USDA Ecology and Evolution of Infectious Diseases program; UK Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council [BB/M008894/1]; NSF-IIS RAPID [1518939]; Fogarty International Center, US National Institutes of Health; Japan Science and Technology Agency CREST project; Japanese Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) KAKENHI [26700028]; St Luke';s Life Science Institute Research Grant for Clinical Epidemiology Research; Commissioned Research program of the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare, Japan [H26-ShinkoJitsuyoka-General-016]; Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council [BB/M008894/1]","GC acknowledges financial support from the NSF grant 1414374 as part of the joint NSF-NIH-USDA Ecology and Evolution of Infectious Diseases program; UK Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council grant BB/M008894/1, NSF-IIS RAPID award #1518939, and NSF grant 1318788 III: Small: Data Management for Real-Time Data Driven Epidemic simulation, and the Division of International Epidemiology and Population Studies, The Fogarty International Center, US National Institutes of Health.

In the summer of 2014, there was great uncertainty about the answers to several key policy questions concerning the path to containment. What is the relative importance of nosocomial transmission compared with community-acquired infection? How much must hospital capacity increase to provide care for the anticipated patient burden? To which interventions will Ebola transmission be most responsive? What must be done to achieve containment? In recent years, epidemic models have been used to guide public health interventions. But, model-based policy relies on high quality causal understanding of transmission, including the availability of appropriate dynamic transmission models and reliable reporting about the sequence of case incidence for model fitting, which were lacking for this epidemic. To investigate the range of potential transmission scenarios, we developed a multi-type branching process model that incorporates key heterogeneities and time-varying parameters to reflect changing human behavior and deliberate interventions in Liberia. Ensembles of this model were evaluated at a set of parameters that were both epidemiologically plausible and capable of reproducing the observed trajectory. Results of this model suggested that epidemic outcome would depend on both hospital capacity and individual behavior. Simulations suggested that if hospital capacity was not increased, then transmission might outpace the rate of isolation and the ability to provide care for the ill, infectious, and dying. Similarly, the model suggested that containment would require individuals to adopt behaviors that increase the rates of case identification and isolation and secure burial of the deceased. As of mid-October, it was unclear that this epidemic would be contained even by 99% hospitalization at the planned hospital capacity. A new version of the model, updated to reflect information collected during October and November 2014, predicts a significantly more constrained set of possible futures. This model suggests that epidemic outcome still depends very heavily on individual behavior. Particularly, if future patient hospitalization rates return to background levels (estimated to be around 70%), then transmission is predicted to remain just below the critical point around R-eff = 1. At the higher hospitalization rate of 85%, this model predicts near complete elimination in March to June, 2015.","[Drake, John M.; Kaul, RajReni B.; Alexander, Laura W.; O'Regan, Suzanne M.; Kramer, Andrew M.; Pulliam, J.

By providing valuable interdisciplinary research experience in science outreach and education initiatives, this module addresses the paucity of structured training or education programs that integrate diverse scientific fields. Its low-cost requirements make it especially suitable for use in resource-limited settings.","[Kaushik, Karishma S.] Univ Texas Austin, Dept Mol Biosci, Austin, TX 78712 USA; [Kessel, Ashley; Ratnayeke, Nalin; Gordon, Vernita D.] Univ Texas Austin, Ctr Nonlinear Dynam, Austin, TX 78712 USA; [Kessel, Ashley; Ratnayeke, Nalin; Gordon, Vernita D.] Univ Texas Austin, Dept Phys, Austin, TX 78712 USA; [Gordon, Vernita D.] Univ Texas Austin, Inst Cellular & Mol Biol, Austin, TX 78712 USA","Kaushik, KS (reprint author), Univ Texas Austin, Dept Mol Biosci, Austin, TX 78712 USA.",gordon@chaos.utexas.edu,,"Gordon, Vernita/0000-0002-5989-9378","Hands-on School; University of Texas, Austin; ExxonMobile; UT Austin","This work was funded by the Hands-on School, by startup funds from The University of Texas, Austin, to VDG, and by a gift from ExxonMobile.

An emerging concept is that, instead, pain might emerge from the coordinated activity of an integrated brain network. In support of this view, Woo and colleagues present evidence that distinct brain networks support the subjective changes in pain that result from nociceptive input and self-directed cognitive modulation. This evidence for the sensitivity of distinct neural subsystems to different aspects of pain opens up the way to more formal computational network theories of pain.","[Mano, Hiroaki; Seymour, Ben] Natl Inst Informat & Commun Technol, Ctr Informat & Neural Networks, Osaka, Japan; [Mano, Hiroaki; Seymour, Ben] Osaka Univ, Immunol Frontiers Res Ctr, Suita, Osaka, Japan; [Seymour, Ben] Univ Cambridge, Dept Engn, Computat & Biol Learning Lab, Cambridge CB2 1PZ, England","Mano, H (reprint author), Natl Inst Informat & Commun Technol, Ctr Informat & Neural Networks, Osaka, Japan.",hiroaki.mano@nict.go.jp; bjs49@cam.ac.uk,,"Seymour, Ben/0000-0003-1724-5832",,,,25,7,7,0,9,PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE,SAN FRANCISCO,"1160 BATTERY STREET, STE 100, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94111 USA",1545-7885,,,PLOS BIOL,PLoS.

CR does not significantly alter steady state levels of intracellular NAD(+) metabolites. However, levels of Sir2 and Pnc1, two enzymes that sequentially convert NAD(+) to nicotinic acid (NA), are up-regulated during CR. To test whether factors such as NA might be exported by glucose-restricted mother cells to survive later generations, we developed a replicative longevity paradigm in which mother cells are moved after 15 generations on defined media. The experiment reveals that CR mother cells lose the longevity benefit of CR when evacuated from their local environment to fresh CR media. Addition of NA or nicotinamide riboside (NR) allows a moved mother to maintain replicative longevity despite the move. Moreover, conditioned medium from CRtreated cells transmits the longevity benefit of CR to moved mother cells. Evidence suggests the existence of a longevity factor that is dialyzable but is neither NA nor NR, and indicates that Sir2 is not required for the longevity factor to be produced or to act. Data indicate that the benefit of glucose-restriction is transmitted from cell to cell in budding yeast, suggesting that glucose restriction may benefit neighboring cells and not only an individual cell.","[Mei, Szu-Chieh; Brenner, Charles] Univ Iowa, Dept Biochem, Carver Coll Med, Iowa City, IA 52242 USA","Mei, SC (reprint author), Univ Iowa, Dept Biochem, Carver Coll Med, Iowa City, IA 52242 USA.",charles-brenner@uiowa.edu,"Brenner, Charles/D-6339-2014","Brenner, Charles/0000-0002-4955-3226",National Science Foundation [MCB-1322118],"Work was supported by National Science Foundation grant MCB-1322118 to CB.

Restoration is generally considered a lower priority action than protection because protection is thought to provide superior outcomes, at lower costs, without the time delay required for restoration. Yet while it is broadly accepted that protected intact habitat safeguards more biodiversity and generates greater ecosystem services per unit area than restored habitat, conservation lacks a theory that can coherently compare the relative outcomes of the two actions. We use a dynamic landscape model to integrate these two actions into a unified conservation theory of protection and restoration. Using nonlinear benefit functions, we show that both actions are crucial components of a conservation strategy that seeks to optimise either biodiversity conservation or ecosystem services provision. In contrast to conservation orthodoxy, in some circumstances, restoration should be strongly preferred to protection. The relative priority of protection and restoration depends on their costs and also on the different time lags that are inherent to both protection and restoration. We derive a simple and easy-to-interpret heuristic that integrates these factors into a single equation that applies equally to biodiversity conservation and ecosystem service objectives. We use two examples to illustrate the theory: bird conservation in tropical rainforests and coastal defence provided by mangrove forests.","[Possingham, Hugh P.; Klein, Carissa J.] Univ Queensland, Sch Biol Sci, Australian Res Council, Ctr Excellence Environm Decis, Brisbane, Qld, Australia; [Possingham, Hugh P.] Imperial Coll London, Dept Life Sci, Silwood Pk, Berks, England; [Bode, Michael] Univ Melbourne, Sch Bot, Australian Res Council, Ctr Excellence Environm Decis, Melbourne, Vic, Australia","Possingham, HP (reprint author), Univ Queensland, Sch Biol Sci, Australian Res Council, Ctr Excellence Environm Decis, Brisbane, Qld, Australia.",h.possingham@uq.edu.au,"Bode, Michael/P-1333-2019; Possingham, Hugh/B-1337-2008; POSSINGHAM, HUGH/R-8310-2019; Bode, Michael/A-7116-2009; Klein, Carissa/F-1632-2011","Bode, Michael/0000-0002-5886-4421; Possingham, Hugh/0000-0001-7755-996X; POSSINGHAM, HUGH/0000-0001-7755-996X; Bode, Michael/0000-0002-5886-4421; Klein, Carissa/0000-0002-6299-6451",Australian Research Council; DECRA Fellowship; ARC Laureate Fellowship,"HPP, MB, and CJK were funded by the Australian Research Council (http://www.arc.gov.au/).

When presented with two carbon sources, microorganisms first consume the carbon substrate that supports the highest growth rate (e.g., glucose) and then switch to the secondary carbon source (e.g., galactose), a paradigm known as the Monod model. Sequential sugar utilization has been attributed to transcriptional repression of the secondary metabolic pathway, followed by activation of this pathway upon depletion of the preferred carbon source. In this work, we demonstrate that although Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells consume glucose before galactose, the galactose regulatory pathway is activated in a fraction of the cell population hours before glucose is fully consumed. This early activation reduces the time required for the population to transition between the two metabolic programs and provides a fitness advantage that might be crucial in competitive environments.","[Venturelli, Ophelia S.; Murray, Richard M.] CALTECH, Div Biol & Biol Engn, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA; [Venturelli, Ophelia S.; Zuleta, Ignacio; El-Samad, Hana] Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Biochem & Biophys, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; [Venturelli, Ophelia S.; Zuleta, Ignacio; El-Samad, Hana] Univ Calif San Francisco, Calif Inst Quantitat Biosci, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA","Venturelli, OS (reprint author), CALTECH, Div Biol & Biol Engn, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA.",hana.el-samad@ucsf.edu,"Murray, Richard/J-2518-2015","Murray, Richard/0000-0002-5785-7481",U.S. Army Research Office [W911NF-09-0001],"Collaborative Biotechnologies through grant W911NF-09-0001 from the U.S. Army Research Office to RMM.

While the structure of the distal ""needle complex"" is well documented, the composition and role of the functionally important cytosolic complex remain less well understood. Using functional fluorescent fusions, we found that the C-ring, an essential and conserved cytosolic component of the system, is composed of similar to 22 copies of SctQ (YscQ in Yersinia enterocolitica), which require the presence of YscQ(C), the product of an internal translation initiation site in yscQ, for their cooperative assembly. Photoactivated localization microscopy (PALM) reveals that in vivo, YscQ is present in both a freemoving cytosolic and a stable injectisome-bound state. Notably, fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) shows that YscQ exchanges between the injectisome and the cytosol, with a t(1/2) of 68 +/- 8 seconds when injectisomes are secreting. In contrast, the secretin SctC (YscC) and the major export apparatus component SctV (YscV) display minimal exchange. Under non-secreting conditions, the exchange rate of YscQ is reduced to t(1/2) = 134 +/- 16 seconds, revealing a correlation between C-ring exchange and injectisome activity, which indicates a possible role for C-ring stability in regulation of type III secretion. The stabilization of the C-ring depends on the presence of the functional ATPase SctN (YscN). These data provide new insights into the formation and composition of the injectisome and present a novel aspect of type III secretion, the exchange of C-ring subunits, which is regulated with respect to secretion.","[Diepold, Andreas; Delalez, Nicolas J.; Armitage, Judith P.] Univ Oxford, Dept Biochem, Oxford OX1 3QU, England; [Kudryashev, Mikhail] Univ Basel, Biozentrum, Basel, Switzerland; [Berry, Richard M.] Univ Oxford, Dept Phys, Clarendon Lab, Oxford OX1 3PU, England","Diepold, A (reprint author), Univ Oxford, Dept Biochem, Oxford OX1 3QU, England.",judith.armitage@bioch.ox.ac.uk,,"Diepold, Andreas/0000-0002-4475-3923; Kudryashev, Misha/0000-0003-3550-6274",EMBO Long-Term Fellowship [EMBO ALTF 170-2011]; Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council; EPA Cephalosporin Fund; Wellcome Trust [091911]; Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council [BB/H01991X/1]; Medical Research Council [MR/K01577X/1],"AD is the recipient of an EMBO Long-Term Fellowship (EMBO ALTF 170-2011) (www.embo.org).

Much evidence suggests that this occurs when phasic dopamine, acting as a reinforcement prediction error, gates plasticity at cortico-striatal synapses, and thereby changes the future likelihood of selecting the action( s) coded by striatal neurons. But this hypothesis faces serious challenges. First, cortico-striatal plasticity is inexplicably complex, depending on spike timing, dopamine level, and dopamine receptor type. Second, there is a credit assignment problem-action selection signals occur long before the consequent dopamine reinforcement signal. Third, the two types of striatal output neuron have apparently opposite effects on action selection. Whether these factors rule out the interface hypothesis and how they interact to produce reinforcement learning is unknown. We present a computational framework that addresses these challenges. We first predict the expected activity changes over an operant task for both types of action-coding striatal neuron, and show they co-operate to promote action selection in learning and compete to promote action suppression in extinction. Separately, we derive a complete model of dopamine and spike-timing dependent cortico-striatal plasticity from in vitro data. We then show this model produces the predicted activity changes necessary for learning and extinction in an operant task, a remarkable convergence of a bottom-up data-driven plasticity model with the top-down behavioural requirements of learning theory. Moreover, we show the complex dependencies of cortico-striatal plasticity are not only sufficient but necessary for learning and extinction. Validating the model, we show it can account for behavioural data describing extinction, renewal, and reacquisition, and replicate in vitro experimental data on cortico-striatal plasticity. By bridging the levels between the single synapse and behaviour, our model shows how striatum acts as the action-reinforcement interface.","[Gurney, Kevin N.; Redgrave, Peter] Univ Sheffield, Dept Psychol, Adapt Behav Res Grp, Sheffield S10 2TN, S Yorkshire, England; [Gurney, Kevin N.] Univ Sheffield, INSIGNEO Inst Silico Med, Sheffield S10 2TN, S Yorkshire, England; [Humphries, Mark D.] Univ Manchester, Fac Life Sci, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England","Gurney, KN (reprint author), Univ Sheffield, Dept Psychol, Adapt Behav Res Grp, Sheffield S10 2TN, S Yorkshire, England.",k.gurney@shef.ac.uk,,"Humphries, Mark/0000-0002-1906-2581",UK grants from the EPSRC [EP/C516303/1 - REVERB]; Wellcome Trust [091409]; EU [FP7-ICT-IP-231722]; French ANR NEUROBOT project [ANR-2010-BLAN-0217-04]; UK MRC Senior non-Clinical Fellowship; Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council [EP/C516303/1]; Medical Research Council [MR/J008648/1],"This work was was supported by UK grants from the EPSRC (EP/C516303/1 - REVERB) and the Wellcome Trust (091409), an EU FP7 grant FP7-ICT-IP-231722 (IM-CLeVeR), the French ANR NEUROBOT project [ANR-2010-BLAN-0217-04], and a UK MRC Senior non-Clinical Fellowship awarded to MDH.

However, its downstream targets in pancreatic beta-cells have not been unequivocally determined. Therefore, we designed cAMP analogues by a structure-guided approach that act as Epac2-selective agonists both in vitro and in vivo. These analogues activate Epac2 about two orders of magnitude more potently than cAMP. The high potency arises from increased affinity as well as increased maximal activation. Crystallographic studies demonstrate that this is due to unique interactions. At least one of the Epac2-specific agonists, Sp8- BnT-cAMPS (S-220), enhances glucose-induced insulin secretion in human pancreatic cells.

When offered two different sugars as carbon sources, microorganisms first consume the preferred sugar, then undergo a transient growth delay, the "" diauxic lag,"" while inducing genes to metabolize the less preferred sugar. This delay is commonly assumed to be an inevitable consequence of selection to maximize use of the preferred sugar. Contrary to this view, we found that many natural isolates of Saccharomyces cerevisiae display short or nonexistent diauxic lags when grown in mixtures of glucose (preferred) and galactose. These strains induce galactose utilization (GAL) genes hours before glucose exhaustion, thereby "" preparing"" for the transition from glucose to galactose metabolism. The extent of preparation varies across strains, and seems to be determined by the steady-state response of GAL genes to mixtures of glucose and galactose rather than by induction kinetics. Although early GAL gene induction gives strains a competitive advantage once glucose runs out, it comes at a cost while glucose is still present. Costs and benefits correlate with the degree of preparation: strains with higher expression of GAL genes prior to glucose exhaustion experience a larger upfront growth cost but also a shorter diauxic lag. Our results show that classical diauxic growth is only one extreme on a continuum of growth strategies constrained by a cost-benefit tradeoff. This type of continuum is likely to be common in nature, as similar tradeoffs can arise whenever cells evolve to use mixtures of nutrients.","[Wang, Jue; Atolia, Esha; Hua, Bo; Savir, Yonatan; Escalante-Chong, Renan; Springer, Michael] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Syst Biol, Boston, MA 02114 USA; [Wang, Jue; Hua, Bo; Escalante-Chong, Renan] Harvard Univ, Syst Biol Grad Program, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA","Wang, J (reprint author), Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Syst Biol, Boston, MA 02114 USA.",michael_springer@hms.harvard.edu,,/0000-0001-6913-4910,National Science Foundation [1349248]; National Institutes of Health [GM080177]; Fundacion Mexico at Harvard; CONACYT; Human Frontier Science Program,"JW, RE, BH, and MS are funded by National Science Foundation (http://www.nsf.gov) grant 1349248; JW by the National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship (https://www.fastlane.nsf.gov/grfp/Login.do) and National Institutes of Health Grant GM080177 (http://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/index.html); RE by the Fundacion Mexico at Harvard (http://www.fundacionharvard.org/english/index.php) and CONACYT (http://www.conacyt.mx/); YS by the Human Frontier Science Program (http://www.hfsp.org/).

The effects of stimulus intensity were mediated by the neurologic pain signature (NPS), an a priori distributed brain network shown to predict physical pain with over 90% sensitivity and specificity across four studies. Self-regulation did not influence NPS responses; instead, its effects were mediated through functional connections between the nucleus accumbens and ventromedial prefrontal cortex. This pathway was unresponsive to noxious input, and has been broadly implicated in valuation, emotional appraisal, and functional outcomes in pain and other types of affective processes. These findings provide evidence that pain reports are associated with two dissociable functional systems: nociceptive/affective aspects mediated by the NPS, and evaluative/functional aspects mediated by a fronto-striatal system.","[Woo, Choong-Wan; Roy, Mathieu; Wager, Tor D.] Univ Colorado, Dept Psychol & Neurosci, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; [Woo, Choong-Wan; Roy, Mathieu; Wager, Tor D.] Univ Colorado, Inst Cognit Sci, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; [Buhle, Jason T.] Columbia Univ, Dept Psychol, New York, NY 10027 USA","Woo, CW (reprint author), Univ Colorado, Dept Psychol & Neurosci, Boulder, CO 80309 USA.",Tor.Wager@Colorado.Edu,"Roy, Mathieu/H-1963-2017; Woo, Choong-Wan/J-2030-2019","Woo, Choong-Wan/0000-0002-7423-5422",Fulbright Graduate Study Fellowship; Canadian Institutes of Health Research grant (CIHR);  [R01 DA027794];  [R01 MH076136],"This work was funded by R01 DA027794 and R01 MH076136 (TDW), by a Fulbright Graduate Study Fellowship to CW, and by a post-doctoral scholarship from the Canadian Institutes of Health Research grant (CIHR) to MR.
