Since, however, uninsured patients in the United States generally cannot afford OPAT, safety-net hospitals are often burdened with long hospitalizations purely to infuse antibiotics, occupying beds that could be used for patients requiring more intensive services. OPAT is generally delivered in one of four settings: infusion centers, nursing homes, at home with skilled nursing assistance, or at home with self-administered therapy. The first three-termed healthcare-administered OPAT (H-OPAT)-are most commonly used in the United States by patients with insurance funding. The fourth-self-administered OPAT (S-OPAT) -is relatively uncommon, with the few published studies having been conducted in the United Kingdom. With multidisciplinary planning, we established an S-OPAT clinic in 2009 to shift care of selected uninsured patients safely to self-administration of their IV antibiotics at home. We undertook this study to determine whether the low-income mostly non-English-speaking patients in our S-OPAT program could administer their own IV antimicrobials at home with outcomes as good as, or better than, those receiving H-OPAT. Methods and Findings Parkland Hospital is a safety-net hospital serving Dallas County, Texas. From 1 January 2009 to 14 October 2013, all uninsured patients meeting criteria were enrolled in S-OPAT, while insured patients were discharged to H-OPAT settings. The S-OPAT patients were trained through multilingual instruction to self-administer IV antimicrobials by gravity, tested for competency before discharge, and thereafter followed at designated intervals in the S-OPAT outpatient clinic for IV access care, laboratory monitoring, and physician follow-up. The primary outcome was 30-d all-cause readmission, and the secondary outcome was 1-y all-cause mortality. The study was adequately powered for readmission but not for mortality. Clinical, sociodemographic, and outcome data were collected from the Parkland Hospital electronic medical records and the US census, constituting a historical prospective cohort study. We used multivariable logistic regression to develop a propensity score predicting S-OPAT versus H-OPAT group membership from covariates. We then estimated the effect of S-OPAT versus H-OPAT on the two outcomes using multivariable proportional hazards regression, controlling for selection bias and confounding with the propensity score and covariates. Of the 1,168 patients discharged to receive OPAT, 944 (81%) were managed in the S-OPAT program and 224 (19%) by H-OPAT services. In multivariable proportional hazards regression models controlling for confounding and selection bias, the 30-d readmission rate was 47% lower in the S-OPAT group (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 0.53; 95% CI 0.35-0.81; p = 0.003), and the 1-y mortality rate did not differ significantly between the groups (aHR, 0.86; 95% CI 0.37-2.00; p = 0.73). The S-OPAT program shifted a median 26 d of inpatient infusion per patient to the outpatient setting, avoiding 27,666 inpatient days. The main limitation of this observational study-the potential bias from the difference in healthcare funding status of the groups-was addressed by propensity score modeling. Conclusions S-OPAT was associated with similar or better clinical outcomes than H-OPAT. S-OPAT may be an acceptable model of treatment for uninsured, medically stable patients to complete extended courses of IV antimicrobials at home.","[Bhavan, Kavita P.] Univ Texas Dallas, Med Ctr, Dept Internal Med, Div Infect Dis, Dallas, TX 75230 USA; [Bhavan, Kavita P.; Brown, L.

Its approval was controversial. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of the aggregated data (registered as PROSPERO 2014:CRD42014014853) to compare the harm/benefit of nalmefene versus placebo or active comparator in this indication. Methods and Findings Three reviewers searched for published and unpublished studies in Medline, the Cochrane Library, Embase, ClinicalTrials.gov, Current Controlled Trials, and bibliographies and by mailing pharmaceutical companies, the European Medicines Agency (EMA), and the US Food and Drug Administration. Double-blind randomized clinical trials evaluating nalmefene to treat adult alcohol dependence, irrespective of the comparator, were included if they reported (1) health outcomes (mortality, accidents/injuries, quality of life, somatic complications), (2) alcohol consumption outcomes, (3) biological outcomes, or (4) treatment safety outcomes, at 6 mo and/or 1 y. Three authors independently screened the titles and abstracts of the trials identified. Relevant trials were evaluated in full text. The reviewers independently assessed the included trials for methodological quality using the Cochrane Collaboration tool for assessing risk of bias. On the basis of the I2 index or the Cochrane's Q test, fixed or random effect models were used to estimate risk ratios (RRs), mean differences (MDs), or standardized mean differences (SMDs) with 95% CIs. In sensitivity analyses, outcomes for participants who were lost to follow-up were included using baseline observation carried forward (BOCF); for binary measures, patients lost to follow-up were considered equal to failures (i.e., non-assessed patients were recorded as not having responded in both groups). Five randomized controlled trials (RCTs) versus placebo, with a total of 2,567 randomized participants, were included in the main analysis. None of these studies was performed in the specific population defined by the EMA approval of nalmefene, i.e., adults with alcohol dependence who consume more than 60 g of alcohol per day (for men) or more than 40 g per day (for women). No RCT compared nalmefene with another medication. Mortality at 6 mo (RR = 0.39, 95% CI [0.08; 2.01]) and 1 y (RR = 0.98, 95% CI [0.04; 23.95]) and quality of life at 6 mo (SF-36 physical component summary score: MD = 0.85, 95% CI [-0.32; 2.01]; SF-36 mental component summary score: MD = 1.01, 95% CI [-1.33; 3.34]) were not different across groups. Other health outcomes were not reported. Differences were encountered for alcohol consumption outcomes such as monthly number of heavy drinking days at 6 mo (MD = -1.65, 95% CI [-2.41; -0.89]) and at 1 y (MD = -1.60, 95% CI [-2.85; -0.35]) and total alcohol consumption at 6 mo (SMD = -0.20, 95% CI [-0.30; -0.10]). An attrition bias could not be excluded, with more withdrawals for nalmefene than for placebo, including more withdrawals for safety reasons at both 6 mo (RR = 3.65, 95% CI [2.02; 6.63]) and 1 y (RR = 7.01, 95% CI [1.72; 28.63]). Sensitivity analyses showed no differences for alcohol consumption outcomes between nalmefene and placebo, but the weight of these results should not be overestimated, as the BOCF approach to managing withdrawals was used. Conclusions The value of nalmefene for treatment of alcohol addiction is not established. At best, nalmefene has limited efficacy in reducing alcohol consumption.","[Palpacuer, Clement; Laviolle, Bruno; Reymann, Jean Michel; Bellissant, Eric; Naudet, Florian] Ctr Hosp Univ Rennes, INSERM, Ctr Invest Clin 1414, Rennes, France; [Laviolle, Bruno; Reymann, Jean Michel; Bellissant, Eric; Naudet, Florian] Univ Rennes 1, Fac Med, Lab Pharmacol Expt & Clin, Rennes, France; [Boussageon, Remy] Univ Poitiers, Dept Med Gen, Fac Med & Pharm, Poitiers, France","Palpacuer, C (reprint author), Ctr Hosp Univ Rennes, INSERM, Ctr Invest Clin 1414, Rennes, France.",floriannaudet@gmail.com,"Palpacuer, Clement/I-9877-2019; Naudet, Florian/H-5644-2019","Palpacuer, Clement/0000-0001-5440-1860; Naudet, Florian/0000-0003-3760-3801",Rennes CHU (CORECT : COmite de la Recherche Clinique et Translationelle),"Supported by a local grant from Rennes CHU (CORECT : COmite de la Recherche Clinique et Translationelle).

Parasitic diseases often result in high burdens of disease in low and middle income countries and are frequently transmitted to humans via contaminated food. This study presents the first estimates of the global and regional human disease burden of 10 helminth diseases and toxoplasmosis that may be attributed to contaminated food. Methods and Findings Data were abstracted from 16 systematic reviews or similar studies published between 2010 and 2015; from 5 disease data bases accessed in 2015; and from 79 reports, 73 of which have been published since 2000, 4 published between 1995 and 2000 and 2 published in 1986 and 1981. These included reports from national surveillance systems, journal articles, and national estimates of foodborne diseases. These data were used to estimate the number of infections, sequelae, deaths, and Disability Adjusted Life Years (DALYs), by age and region for 2010. These parasitic diseases, resulted in 48.4 million cases (95% Uncertainty intervals [UI] of 43.4-79.0 million) and 59,724 (95% UI 48,017-83,616) deaths annually resulting in 8.78 million (95% UI 7.62-12.51 million) DALYs. We estimated that 48% (95% UI 38%-56%) of cases of these parasitic diseases were foodborne, resulting in 76% (95% UI 65%-81%) of the DALYs attributable to these diseases. Overall, foodborne parasitic disease, excluding enteric protozoa, caused an estimated 23.2 million (95% UI 18.2-38.1 million) cases and 45,927 (95% UI 34,763-59,933) deaths annually resulting in an estimated 6.64 million (95% UI 5.61-8.41 million) DALYs. Foodborne Ascaris infection (12.3 million cases, 95% UI 8.29-22.0 million) and foodborne toxoplasmosis (10.3 million cases, 95% UI 7.40-14.9 million) were the most common foodborne parasitic diseases. Human cysticercosis with 2.78 million DALYs (95% UI 2.14-3.61 million), foodborne trematodosis with 2.02 million DALYs (95% UI 1.65-2.48 million) and foodborne toxoplasmosis with 825,000 DALYs (95% UI 561,000-1.26 million) resulted in the highest burdens in terms of DALYs, mainly due to years lived with disability. Foodborne enteric protozoa, reported elsewhere, resulted in an additional 67.2 million illnesses or 492,000 DALYs. Major limitations of our study include often substantial data gaps that had to be filled by imputation and suffer from the uncertainties that surround such models. Due to resource limitations it was also not possible to consider all potentially foodborne parasites (for example Trypanosoma cruzi). Conclusions Parasites are frequently transmitted to humans through contaminated food. These estimates represent an important step forward in understanding the impact of foodborne diseases globally and regionally. The disease burden due to most foodborne parasites is highly focal and results in significant morbidity and mortality among vulnerable populations.","[Torgerson, Paul R.] Univ Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland; [Devleesschauwer, Brecht] Univ Ghent, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium; [Devleesschauwer, Brecht; Speybroeck, Niko] Catholic Univ Louvain, B-1200 Brussels, Belgium; [Devleesschauwer, Brecht; Praet, Nicolas] Inst Trop Med, B-2000 Antwerp, Belgium; [Willingham, Arve Lee] Ross Univ, Sch Vet Med, Basseterre, St Kitts & Nevi; [Kasuga, Fumiko] Natl Inst Hlth Sci, Tokyo, Japan; [Rokni, Mohammad B.] Univ Tehran Med Sci, Tehran, Iran; [Zhou, Xiao-Nong] Chinese Ctr Dis Control & Prevent, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Fevre, Eric M.] Univ Liverpool, Liverpool L69 3BX, Merseyside, England; [Fevre, Eric M.] Int Livestock Res Inst, Nairobi, Kenya; [Sripa, Banchob] Khon Kaen Univ, Khon Kaen, Thailand; [Gargouri, Neyla] Hikma Pharmaceut, Amman, Jordan; [Fuerst, Thomas] Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, London, England; [Budke, Christine M.] Texas A&M Univ, College Stn, TX USA; [Carabin, Helene] Univ Oklahoma, Hlth Sci Ctr, Oklahoma City, OK USA; [Kirk, Martyn D.] Australian Natl Univ, Canberra, ACT, Australia; [Angulo, Frederick J.] Ctr Dis Control & Prevent, Atlanta, GA USA; [Havelaar, Arie] Natl Inst Publ Hlth & Environm, NL-3720 BA Bilthoven, Netherlands; [Havelaar, Arie] Univ Utrecht, Utrecht, Netherlands; [Havelaar, Arie] Univ Florida, Gainesville, FL USA; [de Silva, Nilanthi] Univ Kelaniya, Ragama, Sri Lanka","Torgerson, PR (reprint author), Univ Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland.",paul.torgerson@access.uzh.ch; nrdesilva@gmail.com,"Devleesschauwer, Brecht/G-9895-2018; Torgerson, Paul/A-7510-2010; Havelaar, Arie H./P-8495-2014; Torgerson, Paul R/M-4447-2013","Devleesschauwer, Brecht/0000-0002-2867-6892; Torgerson, Paul/0000-0003-4277-9983; Havelaar, Arie H./0000-0002-6456-5460; Torgerson, Paul R/0000-0003-4277-9983; Fevre, Eric/0000-0001-8931-4986; Kirk, Martyn/0000-0001-5432-5984; Rokni, Mohammad Bagher/0000-0002-1048-2512; Budke, Christine/0000-0002-4750-0905",World Health Organization (WHO); Medical Research Council [G1100783],This study was commissioned and paid for by the World Health Organization (WHO) (http://www.who.int).

WHO guidelines indicate only marginal benefit for regimens based directly on drug susceptibility testing (DST) results. Recent evidence from isolated cohorts suggests that regimens containing more drugs may be beneficial, and that DST results are predictive of regimen effectiveness. The objective of our study was to gain insight into how regimen design affects treatment response by analyzing the association between time to sputum culture conversion and both the number of potentially effective drugs included in a regimen and the DST results of the drugs in the regimen. Methods and Findings We analyzed data from the Preserving Effective Tuberculosis Treatment Study (PETTS), a prospective observational study of 1,659 adults treated for MDR TB during 2005-2010 in nine countries: Estonia, Latvia, Peru, Philippines, Russian Federation, South Africa, South Korea, Thailand, and Taiwan. For all patients, monthly sputum samples were collected, and DST was performed on baseline isolates at the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. We included 1,137 patients in our analysis based on their having known baseline DST results for at least fluoroquinolones and second-line injectable drugs, and not having extensively drug-resistant TB. These patients were followed for a median of 20 mo (interquartile range 16-23 mo) after MDR TB treatment initiation. The primary outcome of interest was initial sputum culture conversion. We used Cox proportional hazards regression, stratifying by country to control for setting-associated confounders, and adjusting for the number of drugs to which patients' baseline isolates were resistant, baseline resistance pattern, previous treatment history, sputum smear result, and extent of disease on chest radiograph. In multivariable analysis, receiving an average of at least six potentially effective drugs (defined as drugs without a DST result indicating resistance) per day was associated with a 36% greater likelihood of sputum culture conversion than receiving an average of at least five but fewer than six potentially effective drugs per day (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 1.36, 95% CI 1.09-1.69). Inclusion of pyrazinamide (aHR 2.00, 95% CI 1.65-2.41) or more drugs to which baseline DST indicated susceptibility (aHR 1.65, 95% CI 1.48-1.84, per drug) in regimens was associated with greater increases in the likelihood of sputum culture conversion than including more drugs to which baseline DST indicated resistance (aHR 1.33, 95% CI 1.18-1.51, per drug). Including in the regimen more drugs for which DST was not performed was beneficial only if a minimum of three effective drugs was present in the regimen (aHR 1.39, 95% CI 1.09-1.76, per drug when three effective drugs present in regimen). The main limitation of this analysis is that it is based on observational data, not a randomized trial, and drug regimens varied across sites. However, PETTS was a uniquely large and rigorous observational study in terms of both the number of patients enrolled and the standardization of laboratory testing. Other limitations include the assumption of equivalent efficacy across drugs in a category, incomplete data on adherence, and the fact that the analysis considers only initial sputum culture conversion, not reversion or long-term relapse. Conclusions MDR TB regimens including more potentially effective drugs than the minimum of five currently recommended by WHO may encourage improved response to treatment in patients with MDR TB. Rapid access to high-quality DST results could facilitate the design of more effective individualized regimens. Randomized controlled trials are necessary to confirm whether individualized regimens with more than five drugs can indeed achieve better cure rates than current recommended regimens.","[Yuen, Courtney M.; Kurbatova, Ekaterina V.; Caoili, Janice Campos; Kvasnovsky, Charlotte; Ershova, Julia; Dalton, Tracy; Cegielski, J.

Behavioral risk factors, such as smoking, poor diet, and physical inactivity, tend to cluster within populations and may have synergistic effects on health. As evidence continues to accumulate on emerging lifestyle risk factors, such as prolonged sitting and unhealthy sleep patterns, incorporating these new risk factors will provide clinically relevant information on combinations of lifestyle risk factors. Methods and Findings Using data from a large Australian cohort of middle-aged and older adults, this is the first study to our knowledge to examine a lifestyle risk index incorporating sedentary behavior and sleep in relation to all-cause mortality. Baseline data (February 2006-April 2009) were linked to mortality registration data until June 15, 2014. Smoking, high alcohol intake, poor diet, physical inactivity, prolonged sitting, and unhealthy (short/long) sleep duration were measured by questionnaires and summed into an index score. Cox proportional hazards analysis was used with the index score and each unique risk combination as exposure variables, adjusted for socio-demographic characteristics. During 6 y of follow-up of 231,048 participants for 1,409,591 person-years, 15,635 deaths were registered. Of all participants, 31.2%, 36.9%, 21.4%, and 10.6% reported 0, 1, 2, and 3+ risk factors, respectively. There was a strong relationship between the lifestyle risk index score and all-cause mortality. The index score had good predictive validity (c index = 0.763), and the partial population attributable risk was 31.3%. Out of all 96 possible risk combinations, the 30 most commonly occurring combinations accounted for more than 90% of the participants. Among those, combinations involving physical inactivity, prolonged sitting, and/or long sleep duration and combinations involving smoking and high alcohol intake had the strongest associations with all-cause mortality. Limitations of the study include self-reported and under-specified measures, dichotomized risk scores, lack of long-term patterns of lifestyle behaviors, and lack of cause-specific mortality data. Conclusions Adherence to healthy lifestyle behaviors could reduce the risk for death from all causes. Specific combinations of lifestyle risk behaviors may be more harmful than others, suggesting synergistic relationships among risk factors.","[Ding, Ding; Rogers, Kris; van der Ploeg, Hidde; Bauman, Adrian E.] Univ Sydney, Sydney Sch Publ Hlth, Prevent Res Collaborat, Camperdown, NSW, Australia; [Ding, Ding; Stamatakis, Emmanuel; Bauman, Adrian E.] Univ Sydney, Charles Perkins Ctr, Camperdown, NSW, Australia; [Rogers, Kris] George Inst Global Hlth, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [van der Ploeg, Hidde] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Med Ctr, EMGO Inst Hlth & Care Res, Dept Publ & Occupat Hlth, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Stamatakis, Emmanuel] Univ Sydney, Fac Hlth Sci, Exercise & Sports Sci, Camperdown, NSW, Australia","Ding, D (reprint author), Univ Sydney, Sydney Sch Publ Hlth, Prevent Res Collaborat, Camperdown, NSW, Australia.",melody.ding@sydney.edu.au,"van der Ploeg, Hidde P/B-2599-2013","van der Ploeg, Hidde P/0000-0002-3719-5249; Ding, Ding/0000-0001-9850-9224",National Health and Medical Research Council,"This study was funded by a National Health and Medical Research Council Early Career Fellowship awarded to DD.

Comprehensive evidence of the long-term effects of contemporary surgery on a broad range of clinical outcomes in large populations treated in routine clinical practice is lacking. The objective of this study was to measure the association between bariatric surgery, weight, body mass index, and obesity-related co-morbidities. Methods and Findings This was an observational retrospective cohort study using data from the United Kingdom Clinical Practice Research Datalink. All 3,882 patients registered in the database and with bariatric surgery on or before 31 December 2014 were included and matched by propensity score to 3,882 obese patients without surgery. The main outcome measures were change in weight and body mass index over 4 y; incident diagnoses of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), hypertension, angina, myocardial infarction (MI), stroke, fractures, obstructive sleep apnoea, and cancer; mortality; and resolution of hypertension and T2DM. Weight measures were available for 3,847 patients between 1 and 4 mo, 2,884 patients between 5 and 12 mo, and 2,258 patients between 13 and 48 mo post-procedure. Bariatric surgery patients exhibited rapid weight loss for the first four postoperative months, at a rate of 4.98 kg/mo (95% CI 4.88-5.08). Slower weight loss was sustained to the end of 4 y. Gastric bypass (6.56 kg/mo) and sleeve gastrectomy (6.29 kg/mo) were associated with greater initial weight reduction than gastric banding (2.77 kg/mo). Protective hazard ratios (HRs) were detected for bariatric surgery for incident T2DM, 0.68 (95% CI 0.55-0.83); hypertension, 0.35 (95% CI 0.27-0.45); angina, 0.59 (95% CI 0.40-0.87); MI, 0.28 (95% CI 0.10-0.74); and obstructive sleep apnoea, 0.55 (95% CI 0.40-0.87). Strong associations were found between bariatric surgery and the resolution of T2DM, with a HR of 9.29 (95% CI 6.84-12.62), and between bariatric surgery and the resolution of hypertension, with a HR of 5.64 (95% CI 2.65-11.99). No association was detected between bariatric surgery and fractures, cancer, or stroke. Effect estimates for mortality found no protective association with bariatric surgery overall, with a HR of 0.97 (95% CI 0.66-1.43). The data used were recorded for the management of patients in primary care and may be subject to inaccuracy, which would tend to lead to underestimates of true relative effect sizes. Conclusions Bariatric surgery as delivered in the UK healthcare system is associated with dramatic weight loss, sustained at least 4 y after surgery. This weight loss is accompanied by substantial improvements in pre-existing T2DM and hypertension, as well as a reduced risk of incident T2DM, hypertension, angina, MI, and obstructive sleep apnoea. Widening the availability of bariatric surgery could lead to substantial health benefits for many people who are morbidly obese.","[Douglas, Ian J.; Bhaskaran, Krishnan; Smeeth, Liam] London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, Fac Epidemiol & Populat Hlth, London WC1, England; [Batterham, Rachel L.] UCL, Dept Med, Obes Res Ctr, Rayne Inst, London, England; [Batterham, Rachel L.] Univ Coll London Hosp, Bariatr Ctr Weight Management & Metab Surg, London, England; [Batterham, Rachel L.] Univ Coll London Hosp, Biomed Res Ctr, Natl Inst Hlth Res, London, England","Douglas, IJ (reprint author), London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, Fac Epidemiol & Populat Hlth, London WC1, England.",ian.douglas@lshtm.ac.uk,"CPRD, CPRD/B-9594-2017",,"Medical Research Council [G0802403/1]; Wellcome Trust; Rosetrees Trust; Sir Henry Dale Fellowship - Wellcome Trust [107731/Z/15/Z]; Sir Henry Dale Fellowship - Royal Society [107731/Z/15/Z]; Medical Research Council [G0802403, MR/K006584/1]; National Institute for Health Research [NF-SI-0510-10090]","IJD is funded by a Medical Research Council Fellowship (G0802403/1).

This makes it difficult to define the baseline CFRs needed to evaluate treatments in the absence of randomized controls. Here, we investigate whether viremia in EVD patients may be used to evaluate baseline EVD CFRs. Methods and Findings We analyzed the laboratory and epidemiological records of patients with EVD confirmed by reverse transcription PCR hospitalized in the Conakry area, Guinea, between 1 March 2014 and 28 February 2015. We used viremia and other variables to model the CFR. Data for 699 EVD patients were analyzed. In the week following symptom onset, mean viremia remained stable, and the CFR increased with viremia, V, from 21% (95% CI 16%-27%) for low viremia (V < 10(4.4) copies/ml) to 53% (95% CI 44%-61%) for intermediate viremia (10(4.4) <= V < 10(5.2) copies/ml) and 81% (95% CI 75%-87%) for high viremia (V >= 10(5.2) copies/ml). Compared to adults (15-44 y old [y. o.]), the CFR was larger in young children (0-4 y.o.) (odds ratio [OR]: 2.44; 95% CI 1.02-5.86) and older adults (>= 45 y.o.) (OR: 2.84; 95% CI 1.81-4.46) but lower in children (5-14 y.o.) (OR: 0.46; 95% CI 0.24-0.86). An order of magnitude increase in mean viremia in cases after July 2014 compared to those before coincided with a 14% increase in the CFR. Our findings come from a large hospital-based study in Conakry and may not be generalizable to settings with different case profiles, such as with individuals who never sought care. Conclusions Viremia in EVD patients was a strong predictor of death that partly explained variations in CFR in the study population. This study provides baseline CFRs by viremia group, which allow appropriate adjustment when estimating efficacy in treatment studies. In randomized controlled trials, stratifying analysis on viremia groups could reduce sample size requirements by 25%. We hypothesize that monitoring the viremia of hospitalized patients may inform the ability of surveillance systems to detect EVD patients from the different severity strata.","[Faye, Oumar; Faye, Ousmane; Fall, Gamou; Sall, Amadou Alpha] Inst Pasteur, Arbovirus & Viral Hemorrhag Fever Unit, Dakar, Senegal; [Andronico, Alessio; Salje, Henrik; Cauchemez, Simon] Inst Pasteur, Math Modelling Infect Dis Unit, Paris, France; [Salje, Henrik] Johns Hopkins Bloomberg Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Epidemiol, Baltimore, MD USA; [Boelle, Pierre-Yves] Inst Pierre Louis Epidemiol & Sante Publ, INSERM, UMR S 1136, Paris, France; [Boelle, Pierre-Yves] Univ Paris 06, Sorbonne Univ, UMR S 1136, Inst Pierre Louis Epidemiol & Sante Publ, Paris, France; [Magassouba, N'Faly] Hop Donka, Lab Fievres Hemorrag Guinee, Conakry, Guinea; [Bah, Elhadj Ibrahima] Med Sans Frontieres, Serv Malad Infect, Conakry, Guinea; [Koivogui, Lamine] Natl Publ Hlth Inst, Conakry, Guinea; [Diallo, Boubacar] WHO, Conakry, Guinea; [Diallo, Alpha Amadou; Keita, Sakoba] Minist Hlth, Conakry, Guinea; [Konde, Mandy Kader] Ctr Excellence Format & Rech Paludisme & Malad Pr, Conakry, Guinea; [Fowler, Robert] Univ Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada","Faye, O (reprint author), Inst Pasteur, Arbovirus & Viral Hemorrhag Fever Unit, Dakar, Senegal.",simon.cauchemez@pasteur.fr,,"Salje, Henrik/0000-0003-3626-4254","French Government's Investissement d'Avenir program, Laboratoire d'Excellence ""Integrative Biology of Emerging Infectious Diseases"" [ANR-10-LABX-62-IBEID]; NIGMS MIDAS initiative; AXA Research Fund; European Union under Institut Pasteur Dakar [278433-PREDEMICS]; Heart and Stroke Foundation, Ontario Provincial Office","This study has received funding from the French Government's Investissement d'Avenir program, Laboratoire d'Excellence ""Integrative Biology of Emerging Infectious Diseases"" (grant noANR-10-LABX-62-IBEID), the NIGMS MIDAS initiative, the AXA Research Fund and the European Union Seventh Framework Programme (FP7/2007-2013) under Grant Agreement number 278433-PREDEMICS, Institut Pasteur Dakar.

To measure the global and regional burden of foodborne disease (FBD), the World Health Organization (WHO) established the Foodborne Disease Burden Epidemiology Reference Group (FERG), which here reports their first estimates of the incidence, mortality, and disease burden due to 31 foodborne hazards. We find that the global burden of FBD is comparable to those of the major infectious diseases, HIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis. The most frequent causes of foodborne illness were diarrheal disease agents, particularly norovirus and Campylobacter spp. Diarrheal disease agents, especially non-typhoidal Salmonella enterica, were also responsible for the majority of deaths due to FBD. Other major causes of FBD deaths were Salmonella Typhi, Taenia solium and hepatitis A virus. The global burden of FBD caused by the 31 hazards in 2010 was 33 million Disability Adjusted Life Years (DALYs); children under five years old bore 40% of this burden. The 14 subregions, defined on the basis of child and adult mortality, had considerably different burdens of FBD, with the greatest falling on the subregions in Africa, followed by the subregions in South-East Asia and the Eastern Mediterranean D subregion. Some hazards, such as nontyphoidal S. enterica, were important causes of FBD in all regions of the world, whereas others, such as certain parasitic helminths, were highly localised. Thus, the burden of FBD is borne particularly by children under five years old-although they represent only 9% of the global population-and people living in low-income regions of the world. These estimates are conservative, i.e., underestimates rather than overestimates; further studies are needed to address the data gaps and limitations of the study. Nevertheless, all stakeholders can contribute to improvements in food safety throughout the food chain by incorporating these estimates into policy development at national and international levels.","[Havelaar, Arie H.] Natl Inst Publ Hlth & Environm, NL-3720 BA Bilthoven, Netherlands; [Havelaar, Arie H.; Devleesschauwer, Brecht] Univ Florida, Gainesville, FL USA; [Havelaar, Arie H.] Univ Utrecht, Utrecht, Netherlands; [Kirk, Martyn D.] Australian Natl Univ, Canberra, ACT, Australia; [Torgerson, Paul R.] Univ Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland; [Gibb, Herman J.] Gibb Epidemiol Consulting, Arlington, VA USA; [Hald, Tine] Danish Tech Univ, Copenhagen, Denmark; [Lake, Robin J.] Inst Environm Sci & Res, Christchurch, New Zealand; [Praet, Nicolas] Inst Trop Med, B-2000 Antwerp, Belgium; [Bellinger, David C.] Boston Childrens Hosp, Boston, MA USA; [De Silva, Nilanthi R.] Univ Kelaniya, Ragama, Sri Lanka; [Gargouri, Neyla] Hikma Pharmaceut, Amman, Jordan; [Speybroeck, Niko; Devleesschauwer, Brecht] Catholic Univ Louvain, B-1200 Brussels, Belgium; [Cawthorne, Amy; Mathers, Colin] WHO, CH-1211 Geneva, Switzerland; [Stein, Claudia] WHO, Reg Off Europe, DK-2100 Copenhagen, Denmark; [Angulo, Frederick J.] Ctr Dis Control & Prevent, Atlanta, GA USA; [Devleesschauwer, Brecht] Univ Ghent, Merelbeke, Belgium","Havelaar, AH (reprint author), Natl Inst Publ Hlth & Environm, NL-3720 BA Bilthoven, Netherlands.",ariehavelaar@ufl.edu,"Havelaar, Arie H./P-8495-2014; Torgerson, Paul R/M-4447-2013; Devleesschauwer, Brecht/G-9895-2018; Pires, Sara/M-2506-2019; Torgerson, Paul/A-7510-2010; Hald, Tine/B-5477-2016; Balakrishnan, Kalpana/B-6653-2015","Havelaar, Arie H./0000-0002-6456-5460; Torgerson, Paul R/0000-0003-4277-9983; Devleesschauwer, Brecht/0000-0002-2867-6892; Pires, Sara/0000-0002-7751-1509; Torgerson, Paul/0000-0003-4277-9983; Hald, Tine/0000-0002-1115-9792; Jensen, Helen/0000-0001-6878-1729; Rokni, Mohammad Bagher/0000-0002-1048-2512; Al Asfoor, Deena/0000-0002-7973-1935; Aspinall, Willy/0000-0001-6014-6042; Kirk, Martyn/0000-0001-5432-5984; Verger, Philippe/0000-0002-6650-2391; Budke, Christine/0000-0002-4750-0905; Balakrishnan, Kalpana/0000-0002-5905-1801; Fevre, Eric/0000-0001-8931-4986; Koopmans, Marion/0000-0002-5204-2312; Majowicz, Shannon/0000-0002-0006-8369; Hoffmann, Sandra/0000-0003-2537-8731",World Health Organization (WHO); Medical Research Council [G1100783],This study was commissioned and paid for by the World Health Organization (WHO).

Which adolescents are likely to benefit most from intervention strongly depends on their long-term risks of harm. We compared 10-y risks of mortality and readmission after adversity-related injury with risks after accident-related injury. Methods and Findings We analysed National Health Service admissions data for England (1 April 1997-31 March 2012) for 10-19 y olds with emergency admissions for adversity-related injury (violent, drug/alcohol-related, or self-inflicted injury; n = 333,009) or for accident-related injury (n = 649,818). We used Kaplan-Meier estimates and Cox regression to estimate and compare 10-y post-discharge risks of death and emergency re-admission. Among adolescents discharged after adversity-related injury, one in 137 girls and one in 64 boys died within 10 y, and 54.2% of girls and 40.5% of boys had an emergency re-admission, with rates being highest for 18-19 y olds. Risks of death were higher than in adolescents discharged after accident-related injury (girls: age-adjusted hazard ratio 1.61, 95% CI 1.43-1.82; boys: 2.13, 95% CI 1.98-2.29), as were risks of re-admission (girls: 1.76, 95% CI 1.74-1.79; boys: 1.41, 95% CI 1.39-1.43). Risks of death and re-admission were increased after all combinations of violent, drug/alcohol-related, and self-inflicted injury, but particularly after any drug/ alcohol-related or self-inflicted injury (i.e., with/without violent injury), for which age-adjusted hazard ratios for death in boys ranged from 1.67 to 5.35, compared with 1.25 following violent injury alone (girls: 1.09 to 3.25, compared with 1.27). The main limitation of the study was under-recording of adversity-related injuries and misclassification of these cases as accident-related injuries. This misclassification would attenuate the relative risks of death and re-admission for adversity-related compared with accident-related injury. Conclusions Adolescents discharged after an admission for violent, drug/alcohol-related, or self-inflicted injury have increased risks of subsequent harm up to a decade later. Introduction of preventive strategies for reducing subsequent harm after admission should be considered for all types of adversity-related injury, particularly for older adolescents.","[Herbert, Annie; Gilbert, Ruth; Gonzalez-Izquierdo, Arturo; Li, Leah] UCL, Inst Child Hlth, Populat Policy & Practice Programme, London, England; [Herbert, Annie; Gilbert, Ruth; Gonzalez-Izquierdo, Arturo] UCL, Farr Inst Hlth Informat Res, Dept Epidemiol & Publ Hlth, London, England; [Pitman, Alexandra] UCL, Div Psychiat, London, England","Herbert, A (reprint author), UCL, Inst Child Hlth, Populat Policy & Practice Programme, London, England.",annie.herbert.12@ucl.ac.uk,,"Pitman, Alexandra/0000-0002-9742-1359","Policy Research Unit in the Health of Children, Young People and Families - Department of Health Policy Research Programme [109/00017]; Department of Health; Medical Research Council [G0802441]","This study was funded by the Policy Research Unit in the Health of Children, Young People and Families (funding reference 109/00017), which is funded by the Department of Health Policy Research Programme.

To our knowledge, we present the first global and regional estimates of the disease burden of the most important foodborne bacterial, protozoal, and viral diseases. Methods and Findings We synthesized data on the number of foodborne illnesses, sequelae, deaths, and Disability Adjusted Life Years (DALYs), for all diseases with sufficient data to support global and regional estimates, by age and region. The data sources included varied by pathogen and included systematic reviews, cohort studies, surveillance studies and other burden of disease assessments. We sought relevant data circa 2010, and included sources from 1990-2012. The number of studies per pathogen ranged from as few as 5 studies for bacterial intoxications through to 494 studies for diarrheal pathogens. To estimate mortality for Mycobacterium bovis infections and morbidity and mortality for invasive non-typhoidal Salmonella enterica infections, we excluded cases attributed to HIV infection. We excluded stillbirths in our estimates. We estimate that the 22 diseases included in our study resulted in two billion (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 1.5-2.9 billion) cases, over one million (95% UI 0.89-1.4 million) deaths, and 78.7 million (95% UI 65.0-97.7 million) DALYs in 2010. To estimate the burden due to contaminated food, we then applied proportions of infections that were estimated to be foodborne from a global expert elicitation. Waterborne transmission of disease was not included. We estimate that 29% (95% UI 23-36%) of cases caused by diseases in our study, or 582 million (95% UI 401-922 million), were transmitted by contaminated food, resulting in 25.2 million (95% UI 17.5-37.0 million) DALYs. Norovirus was the leading cause of foodborne illness causing 125 million (95% UI 70-251 million) cases, while Campylobacter spp. caused 96 million (95% UI 52-177 million) foodborne illnesses. Of all foodborne diseases, diarrheal and invasive infections due to non-typhoidal S. enterica infections resulted in the highest burden, causing 4.07 million (95% UI 2.49-6.27 million) DALYs. Regionally, DALYs per 100,000 population were highest in the African region followed by the South East Asian region. Considerable burden of foodborne disease is borne by children less than five years of age. Major limitations of our study include data gaps, particularly in middle-and high-mortality countries, and uncertainty around the proportion of diseases that were foodborne. Conclusions Foodborne diseases result in a large disease burden, particularly in children. Although it is known that diarrheal diseases are a major burden in children, we have demonstrated for the first time the importance of contaminated food as a cause. There is a need to focus food safety interventions on preventing foodborne diseases, particularly in low-and middle-income settings.","[Kirk, Martyn D.; Angulo, Frederick J.] Australian Natl Univ, Canberra, ACT, Australia; [Pires, Sara M.; Hald, Tine] Danish Tech Univ, Copenhagen, Denmark; [Black, Robert E.; Fischer-Walker, Christa L.] Johns Hopkins Univ, Baltimore, MD USA; [Caipo, Marisa] Food & Agr Org, Rome, Italy; [Crump, John A.] Univ Otago, Ctr Int Hlth, Dunedin, New Zealand; [Devleesschauwer, Brecht] Univ Ghent, Merelbeke, Belgium; [Devleesschauwer, Brecht] Catholic Univ Louvain, B-1200 Brussels, Belgium; [Devleesschauwer, Brecht] Inst Trop Med, B-2000 Antwerp, Belgium; [Doepfer, Doerte] Univ Wisconsin, Madison, WI USA; [Fazil, Aamir] Publ Hlth Agcy Canada, Guelph, ON, Canada; [Hall, Aron J.; Angulo, Frederick J.] Ctr Dis Control & Prevent, Atlanta, GA USA; [Keddy, Karen H.] Univ Witwatersrand, Ctr Enter Dis, Natl Inst Communicable Dis, Johannesburg, South Africa; [Keddy, Karen H.] Univ Witwatersrand, Fac Hlth Sci, Johannesburg, South Africa; [Lake, Robin J.] Inst Environm Sci & Res, Christchurch, New Zealand; [Lanata, Claudio F.] Inst Invest Nutr, Lima, Peru; [Lanata, Claudio F.] US Naval Med Res Unit 6, Callao, Peru; [Torgerson, Paul R.] Univ Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland; [Havelaar, Arie H.] Natl Inst Publ Hlth & Environm, NL-3720 BA Bilthoven, Netherlands; [Havelaar, Arie H.] Univ Florida, Gainesville, FL USA; [Havelaar, Arie H.] Univ Utrecht, Utrecht, Netherlands","Kirk, MD (reprint author), Australian Natl Univ, Canberra, ACT, Australia.",martyn.kirk@anu.edu.au,"Pires, Sara/M-2506-2019; Torgerson, Paul/A-7510-2010; Hald, Tine/B-5477-2016; Havelaar, Arie H./P-8495-2014; Devleesschauwer, Brecht/G-9895-2018; Torgerson, Paul R/M-4447-2013; Lanata, Claudio F./N-7997-2018","Pires, Sara/0000-0002-7751-1509; Torgerson, Paul/0000-0003-4277-9983; Hald, Tine/0000-0002-1115-9792; Havelaar, Arie H./0000-0002-6456-5460; Devleesschauwer, Brecht/0000-0002-2867-6892; Torgerson, Paul R/0000-0003-4277-9983; Lanata, Claudio F./0000-0002-6994-7425; Kirk, Martyn/0000-0001-5432-5984",World Health Organization (WHO); Bill AMP; Melinda Gates Foundation through the Child Health Epidemiology Reference Group (CHERG),"This study was commissioned and paid for by the World Health Organization (WHO).

Methods and Findings We collected and harmonized data on mortality from four alcohol-related causes (alcoholic psychosis, dependence, and abuse; alcoholic cardiomyopathy; alcoholic liver cirrhosis; and accidental poisoning by alcohol) by age, sex, education level, and occupational class in 20 European populations from 17 different countries, both for a recent period and for previous points in time, using data from mortality registers. Mortality was age-standardized using the European Standard Population, and measures for both relative and absolute inequality between low and high socioeconomic groups (as measured by educational level and occupational class) were calculated. Rates of alcohol-related mortality are higher in lower educational and occupational groups in all countries. Both relative and absolute inequalities are largest in Eastern Europe, and Finland and Denmark also have very large absolute inequalities in alcohol-related mortality. For example, for educational inequality among Finnish men, the relative index of inequality is 3.6 (95% CI 3.3-4.0) and the slope index of inequality is 112.5 (95% CI 106.2-118.8) deaths per 100,000 person-years. Over time, the relative inequality in alcohol-related mortality has increased in many countries, but the main change is a strong rise of absolute inequality in several countries in Eastern Europe (Hungary, Lithuania, Estonia) and Northern Europe (Finland, Denmark) because of a rapid rise in alcohol-related mortality in lower socioeconomic groups. In some of these countries, alcohol-related causes now account for 10% or more of the socioeconomic inequality in total mortality. Because our study relies on routinely collected underlying causes of death, it is likely that our results underestimate the true extent of the problem. Conclusions Alcohol-related conditions play an important role in generating inequalities in total mortality in many European countries. Countering increases in alcohol-related mortality in lower socioeconomic groups is essential for reducing inequalities in mortality. Studies of why such increases have not occurred in countries like France, Switzerland, Spain, and Italy can help in developing evidence-based policies in other European countries.","[Mackenbach, Johan P.; Kulhanova, Ivana; Looman, Caspar W.

It is important to distinguish between these two etiologies early and accurately because this has significant therapeutic implications for critically ill patients. We hypothesized that a molecular classifier based on peripheral blood RNAs could be discovered that would (1) determine which patients with systemic inflammation had sepsis, (2) be robust across independent patient cohorts, (3) be insensitive to disease severity, and (4) provide diagnostic utility. The goal of this study was to identify and validate such a molecular classifier. Methods and Findings We conducted an observational, non-interventional study of adult patients recruited from tertiary intensive care units (ICUs). Biomarker discovery utilized an Australian cohort (n = 105) consisting of 74 cases (sepsis patients) and 31 controls (post-surgical patients with infection-negative systemic inflammation) recruited at five tertiary care settings in Brisbane, Australia, from June 3, 2008, to December 22, 2011. A four-gene classifier combining CEACAM4, LAMP1, PLA2G7, and PLAC8 RNA biomarkers was identified. This classifier, designated SeptiCyte Lab, was validated using reverse transcription quantitative PCR and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis in five cohorts (n = 345) from the Netherlands. Patients for validation were selected from the Molecular Diagnosis and Risk Stratification of Sepsis study (ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01905033), which recruited ICU patients from the Academic Medical Center in Amsterdam and the University Medical Center Utrecht. Patients recruited from November 30, 2012, to August 5, 2013, were eligible for inclusion in the present study. Validation cohort 1 (n = 59) consisted entirely of unambiguous cases and controls; SeptiCyte Lab gave an area under curve (AUC) of 0.95 (95% CI 0.91-1.00) in this cohort. ROC curve analysis of an independent, more heterogeneous group of patients (validation cohorts 2-5; 249 patients after excluding 37 patients with an infection likelihood of ""possible"") gave an AUC of 0.89 (95% CI 0.85-0.93). Disease severity, as measured by Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score or Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) IV score, was not a significant confounding variable. The diagnostic utility of SeptiCyte Lab was evaluated by comparison to various clinical and laboratory parameters available to a clinician within 24 h of ICU admission. SeptiCyte Lab was significantly better at differentiating cases from controls than all tested parameters, both singly and in various logistic combinations, and more than halved the diagnostic error rate compared to procalcitonin in all tested cohorts and cohort combinations. Limitations of this study relate to (1) cohort compositions that do not perfectly reflect the composition of the intended use population, (2) potential biases that could be introduced as a result of the current lack of a gold standard for diagnosing sepsis, and (3) lack of a complete, unbiased comparison to C-reactive protein. Conclusions SeptiCyte Lab is a rapid molecular assay that may be clinically useful in managing ICU patients with systemic inflammation. Further study in population-based cohorts is needed to validate this assay for clinical use.","[McHugh, Leo] Immunexpress, Seattle, WA USA; [Sutherland, Allison J.] Biosurg Ingenu, Paddington, NSW, Australia; [Presneill, Jeffrey J.] Mater Hlth Serv, Dept Intens Care Med, South Brisbane, Qld, Australia; [Venter, Deon J.] Mater Hlth Serv, Dept Pathol, South Brisbane, Qld, Australia; [Venter, Deon J.] Univ Queensland, Sch Med, St Lucia, Qld, Australia; [Venter, Deon J.] Univ Queensland, Mater Res Inst, St Lucia, Qld, Australia; [Presneill, Jeffrey J.] Univ Queensland, Burns Trauma & Crit Care Res Ctr, St Lucia, Qld, Australia; [Lipman, Jeffrey] Royal Brisbane & Womens Hosp, Dept Intens Care Med, Herston, Qld, Australia; [Thomas, Mervyn R.] Emphron Informat, Toowong, Qld, Australia; [Klouwenberg, Peter M.

Additionally, emerging data suggest an increased risk of acute cardiovascular events following herpes zoster. However, to our knowledge, existing association studies compare outcomes between individuals and are therefore vulnerable to between-person confounding. In this study, we used a within-person study design to quantify any short-term increased risk of acute cardiovascular events (stroke and myocardial infarction [MI]) after zoster and to assess whether zoster vaccination modifies this association. Methods and Findings The self-controlled case series method was used to estimate rates of stroke and acute MI in defined periods after herpes zoster compared to other time periods, within individuals. Participants were fully eligible Medicare beneficiaries aged >= 65 y with a herpes zoster diagnosis and either an ischemic stroke (n = 42,954) or MI (n = 24,237) between 1 January 2006 and 31 December 2011. Age-adjusted incidence ratios (IRs) for stroke and MI during predefined periods up to 12 mo after zoster relative to unexposed time periods were calculated using conditional Poisson regression. We observed a marked increase in the rate of acute cardiovascular events in the first week after zoster diagnosis: a 2.4-fold increased ischemic stroke rate (IR 2.37, 95% CI 2.17-2.59) and a 1.7-fold increased MI rate (IR 1.68, 95% CI 1.47-1.92), followed by a gradual resolution over 6 mo. Zoster vaccination did not appear to modify the association with MI (interaction p-value = 0.44). We also found no evidence for a difference in the IR for ischemic stroke between vaccinated (IR 1.14, 95% CI 0.75-1.74) and unvaccinated (IR 1.78, 95% CI 1.68-1.88) individuals during the first 4 wk after zoster diagnosis (interaction p-value = 0.28). The relatively few vaccinated individuals limited the study's power to assess the role of vaccination. Conclusions Stroke and MI rates are transiently increased after exposure to herpes zoster. We found no evidence for a role of zoster vaccination in these associations. These findings enhance our understanding of the temporality and magnitude of the association between zoster and acute cardiovascular events.","[Minassian, Caroline; Thomas, Sara L.; Smeeth, Liam; Douglas, Ian; Langan, Sinead M.] London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, Fac Epidemiol & Populat Hlth, London WC1, England; [Brauer, Ruth] Kings Coll London, Dept Hlth Serv & Populat Res, London, England","Minassian, C (reprint author), London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, Fac Epidemiol & Populat Hlth, London WC1, England.",caroline.minassian@lshtm.ac.uk,,"Brauer, Ruth/0000-0001-8934-347X; Langan, Sinead/0000-0002-7022-7441","Wellcome Trust [098504/Z/12/Z]; NIHR [NIHR/CS/010/014, NIHR/CDF/2010-03-32]; Stroke Association [TSA 2011/05]; National Institute for Health Research (NIHR); Medical Research Council [MR/K006584/1, G0802403]; National Institute for Health Research [CDF-2010-03-32, NF-SI-0510-10090, NIHR/CS/010/014]","This work was supported by a Wellcome Trust Senior Fellowship in Clinical Science (to LS, grant number: 098504/Z/12/Z), an NIHR Clinician Scientist Fellowship (to SML, grant number: NIHR/CS/010/014), an NIHR Career Development Fellowship (to SLT, grant number: NIHR/CDF/2010-03-32), and a grant from the Stroke Association (to SLT, grant number: TSA 2011/05).

We assessed-at the population level-whether and to what extent mass HIV treatment is associated with changes in sex disparities in adult life expectancy, a summary metric of survival capturing mortality across the full cascade of HIV care. We also determined sex-specific trends in HIV mortality and the distribution of HIV-related deaths in men and women prior to and at each stage of the clinical cascade. Methods and Findings Data were collected on all deaths occurring from 2001 to 2011 in a large population-based surveillance cohort (52,964 women and 45,688 men, ages 15 y and older) in rural KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. Cause of death was ascertained by verbal autopsy (93% response rate). Demographic data were linked at the individual level to clinical records from the public sector HIV treatment and care program that serves the region. Annual rates of HIV-related mortality were assessed for men and women separately, and female-to-male rate ratios were estimated in exponential hazard models. Sex-specific trends in adult life expectancy and HIV-cause-deleted adult life expectancy were calculated. The proportions of HIV deaths that accrued to men and women at different stages in the HIV cascade of care were estimated annually. Following the beginning of HIV treatment scale-up in 2004, HIV mortality declined among both men and women. Female adult life expectancy increased from 51.3 y (95% CI 49.7, 52.8) in 2003 to 64.5 y (95% CI 62.7, 66.4) in 2011, a gain of 13.2 y. Male adult life expectancy increased from 46.9 y (95% CI 45.6, 48.2) in 2003 to 55.9 y (95% CI 54.3, 57.5) in 2011, a gain of 9.0 y. The gap between female and male adult life expectancy doubled, from 4.4 y in 2003 to 8.6 y in 2011, a difference of 4.3 y (95% CI 0.9, 7.6). For women, HIV mortality declined from 1.60 deaths per 100 person-years (95% CI 1.46, 1.75) in 2003 to 0.56 per 100 person-years (95% CI 0.48, 0.65) in 2011. For men, HIV-related mortality declined from 1.71 per 100 person-years (95% CI 1.55, 1.88) to 0.76 per 100 person-years (95% CI 0.67, 0.87) in the same period. The female-to-male rate ratio for HIV mortality declined from 0.93 (95% CI 0.82-1.07) in 2003 to 0.73 (95% CI 0.60-0.89) in 2011, a statistically significant decline (p = 0.046). In 2011, 57% and 41% of HIV-related deaths occurred among men and women, respectively, who had never sought care for HIV in spite of the widespread availability of free HIV treatment. The results presented here come from a poor rural setting in southern Africa with high HIV prevalence and high HIV treatment coverage; broader generalizability is unknown. Additionally, factors other than HIV treatment scale-up may have influenced population mortality trends. Conclusions Mass HIV treatment has been accompanied by faster declines in HIV mortality among women than men and a growing female-male disparity in adult life expectancy at the population level. In 2011, over half of male HIV deaths occurred in men who had never sought clinical HIV care. Interventions to increase HIV testing and linkage to care among men are urgently needed.","[Bor, Jacob; Rosen, Sydney] Boston Univ, Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Global Hlth, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Bor, Jacob; Chimbindi, Natsayi; Haber, Noah; Herbst, Kobus; Mutevedzi, Tinofa; Tanser, Frank; Pillay, Deenan; Baernighausen, Till] Africa Ctr Populat Hlth, Mtubatuba, South Africa; [Bor, Jacob; Rosen, Sydney] Univ Witwatersrand, Hlth Econ & Epidemiol Res Off, Dept Internal Med, Sch Clin Med,Fac Hlth Sci, Johannesburg, South Africa; [Haber, Noah; Baernighausen, Till] Harvard Univ, TH Chan Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Global Hlth & Populat, Boston, MA USA; [Pillay, Deenan] UCL, Fac Med Sci, London, England","Bor, J (reprint author), Boston Univ, Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Global Hlth, Boston, MA 02215 USA.",jbor@bu.edu,,"Haber, Noah/0000-0002-5672-1769; Rosen, Sydney/0000-0002-6560-2964; Pillay, Dorsamy/0000-0003-3640-2573",National Institutes of Health [1K01MH105320-01A1]; US Agency for International Development [AID 674-a-12-00029]; National Institutes of Health (NIH) [1R01MH083539]; Wellcome Trust [082384/Z/07/Z]; United States Agency for International Development (USAID); President's Emergency Plan (PEPFAR) [674-A-00-08-0001-00]; Academy of Medical Sciences (AMS) [AMS-NAF2-Tanser],"This work was partially supported by: National Institutes of Health (www.nih.gov) award 1K01MH105320-01A1 (J.B.); US Agency for International Development (www.usaid.gov) cooperative agreement AID 674-a-12-00029 (J.B., S.R.); and National Institutes of Health (NIH) award 1R01MH083539 (T.B.).

Here, we sought to understand the mechanisms by which natural killer (NK) cells recognize HIV-1-infected cells and how this virus can evade NK-cell-mediated immune pressure. Methods and Findings Two sequence mutations in p24 Gag associated with the presence of specific KIR/HLA combined genotypes were identified in HIV-1 clade C viruses from a large cohort of infected, untreated individuals in South Africa (n = 392), suggesting viral escape from KIR+NK cells through sequence variations within HLA class I-presented epitopes. One sequence polymorphism at position 303 of p24 Gag (TGag303V), selected for in infected individuals with both KIR2DL3 and HLA-C*03:04, enabled significantly better binding of the inhibitory KIR2DL3 receptor to HLA-C*03:04-expressing cells presenting this variant epitope compared to the wild-type epitope (wild-type mean 18.01 +/- 10.45 standard deviation [SD] and variant mean 44.67 +/- 14.42 SD, p = 0.002). Furthermore, activation of primary KIR2DL3+ NK cells from healthy donors in response to HLA-C*03:04+ target cells presenting the variant epitope was significantly reduced in comparison to cells presenting the wild-type sequence (wild-type mean 0.78 +/- .07 standard error of the mean [SEM] and variant mean 0.63 +/- 0.07 SEM, p = 0.012). Structural modeling and surface plasmon resonance of KIR/ peptide/HLA interactions in the context of the different viral sequence variants studied supported these results. Future studies will be needed to assess processing and antigen presentation of the investigated HIV-1 epitope in natural infection, and the consequences for viral control. Conclusions These data provide novel insights into how viruses can evade NK cell immunity through the selection of mutations in HLA-presented epitopes that enhance binding to inhibitory NK cell receptors. Better understanding of the mechanisms by which HIV-1 evades NK-cell-mediated immune pressure and the functional validation of a structural modeling approach will facilitate the development of novel targeted immune interventions to harness the antiviral activities of NK","[Hoelzemer, Angelique; Thobakgale, Christina F.; Garcia-Beltran, Wilfredo F.; Koerner, Christian; Chung, Amy W.; Alter, Galit; Walker, Bruce D.; Carrington, Mary; Ndung'u, Thumbi; Altfeld, Marcus] MIT & Harvard, Ragon Inst MGH, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Hoelzemer, Angelique; Altfeld, Marcus] Heinrich Pette Inst, Leibniz Inst Expt Virol, Hamburg, Germany; [Hoelzemer, Angelique] Univ Med Ctr Hamburg Eppendorf, Dept Internal Med 1, Hamburg, Germany; [Thobakgale, Christina F.; Mann, Jaclyn K.; Jaggernath, Manjeetha; Ndung'u, Thumbi] Univ KwaZulu Natal, Nelson R Mandela Sch Med, KwaZulu Natal Res Inst TB & HIV, HIV Pathogenesis Programme,Doris Duke Med Res Ins, Durban, South Africa; [Cruz, Camilo A.

In this combined mathematical and phylogenetic study of observational data, we aimed to find out the extent to which the resurgent epidemic is the result of newly introduced strains or of growth of already circulating strains. Methods and Findings As of November 2011, the ATHENA observational HIV cohort of all patients in care in the Netherlands since 1996 included HIV-1 subtype B polymerase sequences from 5,852 patients. Patients who were diagnosed between 1981 and 1995 were included in the cohort if they were still alive in 1996. The ten most similar sequences to each ATHENA sequence were selected from the Los Alamos HIV Sequence Database, and a phylogenetic tree was created of a total of 8,320 sequences. Large transmission clusters that included >= 10 ATHENA sequences were selected, with a local support value >= 0.9 and median pairwise patristic distance below the fifth percentile of distances in the whole tree. Time-varying reproduction numbers of the large MSM-majority clusters were estimated through mathematical modeling. We identified 106 large transmission clusters, including 3,061 (52%) ATHENA and 652 Los Alamos sequences. Half of the HIV sequences from MSM registered in the cohort in the Netherlands (2,128 of 4,288) were included in 91 large MSM-majority clusters. Strikingly, at least 54 (59%) of these 91 MSM-majority clusters were already circulating before 1996, when cART was introduced, and have persisted to the present. Overall, 1,226 (35%) of the 3,460 diagnoses among MSM since 1996 were found in these 54 long-standing clusters. The reproduction numbers of all large MSM-majority clusters were around the epidemic threshold value of one over the whole study period. A tendency towards higher numbers was visible in recent years, especially in the more recently introduced clusters. The mean age of MSM at diagnosis increased by 0.45 years/year within clusters, but new clusters appeared with lower mean age. Major strengths of this study are the high proportion of HIV-positive MSM with a sequence in this study and the combined application of phylogenetic and modeling approaches. Main limitations are the assumption that the sampled population is representative of the overall HIV-positive population and the assumption that the diagnosis interval distribution is similar between clusters. Conclusions The resurgent HIV epidemic amongst MSM in the Netherlands is driven by several large, persistent, self-sustaining, and, in many cases, growing sub-epidemics shifting towards new generations of MSM. Many of the sub-epidemics have been present since the early epidemic, to which new sub-epidemics are being added.","[Bezemer, Daniela; van Sighem, Ard; Gras, Luuk; van den Hengel, Rob; Reiss, Peter] HIV Monitoring Fdn, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Cori, Anne; Ratmann, Oliver; Fraser, Christophe] Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Infect Dis Epidemiol, Ctr Outbreak Anal & Modellin,MRC, London, England; [Hermanides, Hillegonda S.] Red Cross Blood Bank Fdn, Willemstad, Curacao, Neth Antilles; [Dutilh, Bas E.] Radboud Univ Nijmegen, Med Ctr, Nijmegen Ctr Mol Life Sci, Ctr Mol & Biomol Informat, NL-6525 ED Nijmegen, Netherlands; [Dutilh, Bas E.] Univ Fed Rio de Janeiro, Inst Biol, Dept Marine Biol, Rio De Janeiro, Brazil; [Dutilh, Bas E.] Univ Utrecht, Theoret Biol & Bioinformat, Utrecht, Netherlands; [Faria, Nuno Rodrigues] Univ Oxford, Dept Zool, Oxford OX1 3PS, England; [Reiss, Peter] Univ Amsterdam, Acad Med Ctr, Dept Global Hlth, NL-1105 AZ Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Reiss, Peter] Amsterdam Inst Global Hlth & Dev, Amsterdam, Netherlands","Bezemer, D (reprint author), HIV Monitoring Fdn, Amsterdam, Netherlands.",d.o.bezemer@amc.uva.nl,"Fraser, Christophe/A-8109-2008; Faria, Nuno/I-2975-2012; Dutilh, Bas/B-9719-2011; Schinkel, Janke/I-3099-2012","Fraser, Christophe/0000-0003-2399-9657; Faria, Nuno/0000-0001-8839-2798; Dutilh, Bas/0000-0003-2329-7890; Schinkel, Janke/0000-0002-1112-0644; Kroes, Aloysius/0000-0002-9866-2461; Ratmann, Oliver/0000-0001-8667-4118; Cori, Anne/0000-0002-8443-9162; van Rossum, Annemarie/0000-0002-1259-477X","NIH through NIAID [UM1 AI068619]; European Research Council [AdG 339251]; Wellcome Trust [WR092311MF]; Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation via PANGEA-HIV consortium; NWO Veni [016.111.075]; CAPES/BRASIL; Bristol-Myers Squibb; ViiV Healthcare; Gilead Sciences; Janssen Pharmaceuticals Inc.; MerckCo.; scientific advisory board for Gilead Sciences; data safety monitoring committee for Janssen Pharmaceuticals Inc.; European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control [ECDC/2012/050]; Dutch Ministry of Health, Welfare and Sport through Centre for Infectious Disease Control of the National Institute for Public Health and the Environment; Medical Research Council [MR/K010174/1, MR/K010174/1B, G0800596]","AC and CF thank the NIH for funding through the NIAID cooperative agreement UM1 AI068619.

However, few studies have projected the global resources needed for rapid scale-up of ART. Under the Health Policy Project, we conducted modeling analyses for 97 countries to estimate eligibility for and numbers on ART from 2015 to 2020, along with the facility-level financial resources required. We compared the estimated financial requirements to estimated funding available. Methods and Findings Current coverage levels and future need for treatment were based on country-specific epidemiological and demographic data. Simulated annual numbers of individuals on treatment were derived from three scenarios: (1) continuation of countries' current policies of eligibility for ART, (2) universal adoption of aspects of the WHO 2013 eligibility guidelines, and (3) expanded eligibility as per the WHO 2015 guidelines and meeting the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS ""90-90-90"" ART targets. We modeled uncertainty in the annual resource requirements for antiretroviral drugs, laboratory tests, and facility-level personnel and overhead. We estimate that 25.7 (95% CI 25.5, 26.0) million adults and 1.57 (95% CI 1.55, 1.60) million children could receive ART by 2020 if countries maintain current eligibility plans and increase coverage based on historical rates, which may be ambitious. If countries uniformly adopt aspects of the WHO 2013 guidelines, 26.5 (95% CI 26.0 27.0) million adults and 1.53 (95% CI 1.52, 1.55) million children could be on ART by 2020. Under the 90-90-90 scenario, 30.4 (95% CI 30.1, 30.7) million adults and 1.68 (95% CI 1.63, 1.73) million children could receive treatment by 2020. The facility-level financial resources needed for scaling up ART in these countries from 2015 to 2020 are estimated to be US$ 45.8 (95% CI 45.4, 46.2) billion under the current scenario, US$48.7 (95% CI 47.8, 49.6) billion under the WHO 2013 scenario, and US$52.5 (95% CI 51.4, 53.6) billion under the 90-90-90 scenario. After projecting recent external and domestic funding trends, the estimated 6-y financing gap ranges from US$19.8 billion to US$25.0 billion, depending on the costing scenario and the U.S. President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief contribution level, with the gap for ART commodities alone ranging from US$14.0 to US$16.8 billion. The study is limited by excluding above-facility and other costs essential to ART service delivery and by the availability and quality of country-and region-specific data. Conclusions The projected number of people receiving ART across three scenarios suggests that countries are unlikely to meet the 90-90-90 treatment target (81% of people living with HIV on ART by 2020) unless they adopt a test-and-offer approach and increase ART coverage. Our results suggest that future resource needs for ART scale-up are smaller than stated elsewhere but still significantly threaten the sustainability of the global HIV response without additional resource mobilization from domestic or innovative financing sources or efficiency gains. As the world moves towards adopting the WHO 2015 guidelines, advances in technology, including the introduction of lower-cost, highly effective antiretroviral regimens, whose value are assessed here, may prove to be ""game changers"" that allow more people to be on ART with the resources available.","[Dutta, Arin; Barker, Catherine; Kallarakal, Ashley] Palladium, Washington, DC 20004 USA","Dutta, A (reprint author), Palladium, Washington, DC 20004 USA.",Arin.Dutta@thepalladiumgroup.com,,,U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) through Health Policy Project; USAID [AID-OAA-A-10-00067]; President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR),"The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) funded this work through the Health Policy Project.

Identifying patients at high risk for the development of venous thromboembolism (VTE) would provide a basis for considering individual thromboprophylaxis use and planning treatment studies. The aims of this study were (1) to investigate the predictive value of genetic and environmental risk factors, levels of coagulation factors, and other biomarkers for the occurrence of VTE after cast immobilization of the lower extremity and (2) to develop a clinical prediction tool for the prediction of VTE in plaster cast patients. Methods and Findings We used data from a large population-based case-control study (MEGA study, 4,446 cases with VTE, 6,118 controls without) designed to identify risk factors for a first VTE. Cases were recruited from six anticoagulation clinics in the Netherlands between 1999 and 2004; controls were their partners or individuals identified via random digit dialing. Identification of predictor variables to be included in the model was based on reported associations in the literature or on a relative risk (odds ratio) > 1.2 and p <= 0.25 in the univariate analysis of all participants. Using multivariate logistic regression, a full prediction model was created. In addition to the full model (all variables), a restricted model (minimum number of predictors with a maximum predictive value) and a clinical model (environmental risk factors only, no blood draw or assays required) were created. To determine the discriminatory power in patients with cast immobilization (n = 230), the area under the curve (AUC) was calculated by means of a receiver operating characteristic. Validation was performed in two other case-control studies of the etiology of VTE: (1) the THE-VTE study, a two-center, population-based case-control study (conducted in Leiden, the Netherlands, and Cambridge, United Kingdom) with 784 cases and 523 controls included between March 2003 and December 2008 and (2) the Milan study, a population-based case-control study with 2,117 cases and 2,088 controls selected between December 1993 and December 2010 at the Thrombosis Center, Fondazione IRCCS Ca' Granda-Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico, Milan, Italy. The full model consisted of 32 predictors, including three genetic factors and six biomarkers. For this model, an AUC of 0.85 (95% CI 0.77-0.92) was found in individuals with plaster cast immobilization of the lower extremity. The AUC for the restricted model (containing 11 predictors, including two genetic factors and one biomarker) was 0.84 (95% CI 0.77-0.92). The clinicalmodel (consisting of 14 environmental predictors) resulted in an AUC of 0.77 (95% CI 0.66-0.87). The clinicalmodel was converted into a risk score, the L-TRiP(cast) score (Leiden-Thrombosis Risk Prediction for patients with cast immobilization score), which showed an AUC of 0.76 (95% CI 0.66-0.86). Validation in the THE-VTE study data resulted in an AUC of 0.77 (95% CI 0.58-0.96) for the L-TRiP(cast) score. Validation in the Milan study resulted in an AUC of 0.93 (95% CI 0.86-1.00) for the fullmodel, an AUC of 0.92 (95% CI 0.76-0.87) for the restrictedmodel, and an AUC of 0.96 (95% CI 0.92-0.99) for the clinical model. The L-TRiP(cast) score resulted in an AUC of 0.95 (95% CI 0.91-0.99). Major limitations of this study were that information on thromboprophylaxis was not available for patients who had plaster cast immobilization of the lower extremity and that blood was drawn 3 mo after the thrombotic event. Conclusions These results show that information on environmental risk factors, coagulation factors, and genetic determinants in patients with plaster casts leads to high accuracy in the prediction of VTE risk. In daily practice, the clinical model may be the preferred model as its factors are most easy to determine, while the model still has good predictive performance. These results may provide guidance for thromboprophylaxis and form the basis for a management study.","[Nemeth, Banne; van Adrichem, Raymond A.; Vlieg, Astrid van Hylckama; Rosendaal, Frits R.; le Cessie, Saskia; Cannegieter, Suzanne C.] Leiden Univ, Med Ctr, Dept Clin Epidemiol, Leiden, Netherlands; [Nemeth, Banne; van Adrichem, Raymond A.] Leiden Univ, Med Ctr, Dept Orthopaed Surg, Leiden, Netherlands; [Bucciarelli, Paolo; Martinelli, Ida] Fdn IRCCS Ca Granda Osped Maggiore Policlin, Angelo Bianchi Bonomi Hemophilia & Thrombosis Ctr, Milan, Italy; [Baglin, Trevor] Addenbrookes Hosp, Dept Haematol, Cambridge CB2 2QQ, England; [Rosendaal, Frits R.] Leiden Univ, Med Ctr, Dept Thrombosis & Haemostasis, Leiden, Netherlands; [le Cessie, Saskia] Leiden Univ, Med Ctr, Dept Med Stat & Bioinformat, Leiden, Netherlands","Nemeth, B (reprint author), Leiden Univ, Med Ctr, Dept Clin Epidemiol, Leiden, Netherlands.",S.C.Cannegieter@lumc.nl,"Martinelli, ida/J-2287-2015; Bucciarelli, Paolo/J-1907-2015; Rosendaal, Frits/Q-3842-2017; van Hylckama Vlieg, Astrid/A-3323-2017","Martinelli, ida/0000-0001-9218-3622; Bucciarelli, Paolo/0000-0003-0877-365X; Rosendaal, Frits/0000-0003-2558-7496; le Cessie, Saskia/0000-0003-2154-4923; Sattar, Naveed/0000-0002-1604-2593",Netherlands Heart Foundation [NHS 98.113]; Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research [912-03-033|2003]; Dutch Cancer Foundation [RUL 99/1992],"Netherlands Heart Foundation (grant NHS 98.113), Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research (grant 912-03-033|2003), Dutch Cancer Foundation (grant RUL 99/1992).

Over 90 different serotypes exist, and nasopharyngeal carriage of multiple serotypes is common. Understanding pneumococcal carriage is essential for evaluating the impact of pneumococcal vaccines. Traditional serotyping methods are cumbersome and insufficient for detecting multiple serotype carriage, and there are few data comparing the new methods that have been developed over the past decade. We established the PneuCarriage project, a large, international multi-centre study dedicated to the identification of the best pneumococcal serotyping methods for carriage studies. Methods and Findings Reference sample sets were distributed to 15 research groups for blinded testing. Twenty pneumococcal serotyping methods were used to test 81 laboratory-prepared (spiked) samples. The five top-performing methods were used to test 260 nasopharyngeal (field) samples collected from children in six high-burden countries. Sensitivity and positive predictive value (PPV) were determined for the test methods and the reference method (traditional serotyping of > 100 colonies from each sample). For the alternate serotyping methods, the overall sensitivity ranged from 1% to 99% (reference method 98%), and PPV from 8% to 100% (reference method 100%), when testing the spiked samples. Fifteen methods had >= 70% sensitivity to detect the dominant (major) serotype, whilst only eight methods had >= 70% sensitivity to detect minor serotypes. For the field samples, the overall sensitivity ranged from 74.2% to 95.8%(reference method 93.8%), and PPV from 82.2% to 96.4% (reference method 99.6%). The microarray had the highest sensitivity (95.8%) and high PPV (93.7%). The major limitation of this study is that not all of the available alternative serotyping methods were included. Conclusions Most methods were able to detect the dominant serotype in a sample, but many performed poorly in detecting the minor serotype populations. Microarray with a culture amplification step was the top-performing method. Results from this comprehensive evaluation will inform future vaccine evaluation and impact studies, particularly in low-income settings, where pneumococcal disease burden remains high.","[Satzke, Catherine; Dunne, Eileen M.; Porter, Barbara D.; Mulholland, E.

We assessed the association between continuous versus intermittent water supply and waterborne diseases, child mortality, and weight for age in Hubli-Dharwad, India. Methods and Findings We conducted a matched cohort study with multivariate matching to identify intermittent and continuous supply areas with comparable characteristics in Hubli-Dharwad. We followed 3,922 households in 16 neighborhoods with children <5 y old, with four longitudinal visits over 15 mo (Nov 2010-Feb 2012) to record caregiver-reported health outcomes (diarrhea, highly credible gastrointestinal illness, bloody diarrhea, typhoid fever, cholera, hepatitis, and deaths of children <2 y old) and, at the final visit, to measure weight for age for children <5 y old. We also collected caregiver-reported data on negative control outcomes (cough/cold and scrapes/bruises) to assess potential bias from residual confounding or differential measurement error. Continuous supply had no significant overall association with diarrhea (prevalence ratio [PR] = 0.93, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.83-1.04, p = 0.19), bloody diarrhea (PR = 0.78, 95% CI: 0.60-1.01, p = 0.06), or weight-for-age z-scores (Delta z = 0.01, 95% CI: -0.07-0.09, p = 0.79) in children <5 y old. In prespecified subgroup analyses by socioeconomic status, children <5 y old in lower-income continuous supply households had 37% lower prevalence of bloody diarrhea (PR = 0.63, 95% CI: 0.46-0.87, p-value for interaction = 0.03) than lower-income intermittent supply households; in higher-income households, there was no significant association between continuous versus intermittent supply and child diarrheal illnesses. Continuous supply areas also had 42% fewer households with >= 1 reported case of typhoid fever (cumulative incidence ratio [CIR] = 0.58, 95% CI: 0.41-0.78, p = 0.001) than intermittent supply areas. There was no significant association with hepatitis, cholera, or mortality of children <2 y old; however, our results were indicative of lower mortality of children <2 y old (CIR = 0.51, 95% CI: 0.22-1.07, p = 0.10) in continuous supply areas. The major limitations of our study were the potential for unmeasured confounding given the observational design and measurement bias from differential reporting of health symptoms given the nonblinded treatment. However, there was no significant difference in the prevalence of the negative control outcomes between study groups that would suggest undetected confounding or measurement bias. Conclusions Continuous water supply had no significant overall association with diarrheal disease or ponderal growth in children <5 y old in Hubli-Dharwad; this might be due to point-of-use water contamination from continuing household storage and exposure to diarrheagenic pathogens through nonwaterborne routes. Continuous supply was associated with lower prevalence of dysentery in children in low-income households and lower typhoid fever incidence, suggesting that intermittently operated piped water systems are a significant transmission mechanism for Salmonella typhi and dysentery-causing pathogens in this urban population, despite centralized water treatment. Continuous supply was associated with reduced transmission, especially in the poorer higher-risk segments of the population.","[Ercumen, Ayse; Arnold, Benjamin F.; Colford, John M., Jr.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Sch Publ Hlth, Div Epidemiol, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Kumpel, Emily; Nelson, Kara] Univ Calif Berkeley, Civil & Environm Engn, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Kumpel, Emily] Aquaya Inst, Nairobi, Kenya; [Burt, Zachary; Ray, Isha] Univ Calif Berkeley, Energy & Resources Grp, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA","Ercumen, A (reprint author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Sch Publ Hlth, Div Epidemiol, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",aercumen@berkeley.edu,,"Ercumen, Ayse/0000-0001-6002-1514; Arnold, Benjamin/0000-0001-6105-7295","Blum Center for Developing Economies at University of California, Berkeley","This work was supported by the Blum Center for Developing Economies at University of California, Berkeley.

In a region where access to improved water sources is particularly poor, the question of which improvements in water access should be prioritized to address cholera transmission remains unresolved. This study aimed at investigating the temporal association between water supply interruptions and Cholera Treatment Centre (CTC) admissions in a medium-sized town. Methods and Findings Time-series patterns of daily incidence of suspected cholera cases admitted to the Cholera Treatment Centre in Uvira in South Kivu Province between 2009 and 2014 were examined in relation to the daily variations in volume of water supplied by the town water treatment plant. Quasi-poisson regression and distributed lag nonlinear models up to 12 d were used, adjusting for daily precipitation rates, day of the week, and seasonal variations. A total of 5,745 patients over 5 y of age with acute watery diarrhoea symptoms were admitted to the CTC over the study period of 1,946 d. Following a day without tap water supply, the suspected cholera incidence rate increased on average by 155% over the next 12 d, corresponding to a rate ratio of 2.55 (95% CI: 1.54-4.24), compared to the incidence experienced after a day with optimal production (defined as the 95th percentile-4,794 m(3)).Suspected cholera cases attributable to a suboptimal tap water supply reached 23.2% of total admissions (95% CI 11.4%-33.2%). Although generally reporting less admissions to the CTC, neighbourhoods with a higher consumption of tap water were more affected by water supply interruptions, with a rate ratio of 3.71 (95% CI: 1.91-7.20) and an attributable fraction of cases of 31.4%(95% CI: 17.3%-42.5%). The analysis did not suggest any association between levels of residual chlorine in the water fed to the distribution network and suspected cholera incidence. Laboratory confirmation of cholera was not available for this analysis. Conclusions A clear association is observed between reduced availability of tap water and increased incidence of suspected cholera in the entire town of Uvira in Eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo. Even though access to piped water supplies is low in Uvira, improving the reliability of tap water supply may substantially reduce the incidence of suspected cholera, in particular in neighbourhoods having a higher access to tap water. These results argue in favour of water supply investments that focus on the delivery of a reliable and sustainable water supply, and not only on point-of-use water quality improvements, as is often seen during cholera outbreaks.","[Jeandron, Aurelie; Cairncross, Sandy; Ensink, Jeroen H.

We sought to prospectively derive and validate two decision instruments (DIs) for selective chest computed tomography (CT) in adult blunt trauma patients. Methods and Findings From September 2011 to May 2014, we prospectively enrolled blunt trauma patients over 14 y of age presenting to eight US, urban level 1 trauma centers in this observational study. During the derivation phase, physicians recorded the presence or absence of 14 clinical criteria before viewing chest imaging results. We determined injury outcomes by CT radiology readings and categorized injuries as major or minor according to an expert-panel-derived clinical classification scheme. We then employed recursive partitioning to derive two DIs: Chest CT-All maximized sensitivity for all injuries, and Chest CT-Major maximized sensitivity for only major thoracic injuries (while increasing specificity). In the validation phase, we employed similar methodology to prospectively test the performance of both DIs. We enrolled 11,477 patients-6,002 patients in the derivation phase and 5,475 patients in the validation phase. The derived Chest CT-All DI consisted of (1) abnormal chest X-ray, (2) rapid deceleration mechanism, (3) distracting injury, (4) chest wall tenderness, (5) sternal tenderness, (6) thoracic spine tenderness, and (7) scapular tenderness. The Chest CT-Major DI had the same criteria without rapid deceleration mechanism. In the validation phase, Chest CT-All had a sensitivity of 99.2%(95% CI 95.4%-100%), a specificity of 20.8% (95% CI 19.2%-22.4%), and a negative predictive value (NPV) of 99.8% (95% CI 98.9%-100%) for major injury, and a sensitivity of 95.4% (95% CI 93.6%-96.9%), a specificity of 25.5% (95% CI 23.5%-27.5%), and a NPV of 93.9%(95% CI 91.5%-95.8%) for either major or minor injury. Chest CT-Major had a sensitivity of 99.2%(95% CI 95.4%100%), a specificity of 31.7%(95% CI 29.9%-33.5%), and a NPV of 99.9% (95% CI 99.3%-100%) for major injury and a sensitivity of 90.7%(95% CI 88.3%-92.8%), a specificity of 37.9% (95% CI 35.8%-40.1%), and a NPV of 91.8%(95% CI 89.7%-93.6%) for either major or minor injury. Regarding the limitations of our work, some clinicians may disagree with our injury classification and sensitivity thresholds for injury detection. Conclusions We prospectively derived and validated two DIs (Chest CT-All and Chest CT-Major) that identify blunt trauma patients with clinically significant thoracic injuries with high sensitivity, allowing for a safe reduction of approximately 25%-37% of unnecessary chest CTs. Trauma evaluation protocols that incorporate these DIs may decrease unnecessary costs and radiation exposure in the disproportionately young trauma population.","[Rodriguez, Robert M.] Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Emergency Med, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; [Langdorf, Mark I.] Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Emergency Med, Irvine, CA USA; [Nishijima, Daniel] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Emergency Med, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Baumann, Brigitte M.] Rowan Univ, Cooper Med Sch, Dept Emergency Med, Camden, NJ USA; [Hendey, Gregory W.] UCSF Fresno Med Educ & Res, Dept Emergency Med, Fresno, CA USA; [Medak, Anthony J.] Univ Calif San Diego, Sch Med, Dept Emergency Med, San Diego, CA 92103 USA; [Raja, Ali S.] Harvard Univ, Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Sch Med, Dept Emergency Med, Boston, MA USA; [Allen, Isabel E.] Univ Calif San Francisco, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; [Mower, William R.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Emergency Med, Los Angeles, CA USA","Rodriguez, RM (reprint author), Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Emergency Med, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA.",robert.rodriguez@emergency.ucsf.edu,,"Langdorf, Mark/0000-0002-9019-2047; Hendey, Gregory/0000-0002-0170-8743",University of California Center for Health Quality and Innovation (CHQI) [071:2011],"Funded by University of California Center for Health Quality and Innovation (CHQI): 071:2011.

Death is caused by the progressive degeneration of striated muscles aggravated by sterile inflammation. The pleiotropic effects of the mutant gene also include cognitive and behavioral impairments and low bone density. Current interventions in DMD are palliative only as no treatment improves the long-term outcome. Therefore, approaches with a translational potential should be investigated, and key abnormalities downstream from the absence of the DMD product, dystrophin, appear to be strong therapeutic targets. We and others have demonstrated that DMD mutations alter ATP signaling and have identified P2RX7 purinoceptor up-regulation as being responsible for the death of muscles in the mdx mouse model of DMD and human DMD lymphoblasts. Moreover, the ATP-P2RX7 axis, being a crucial activator of innate immune responses, can contribute to DMD pathology by stimulating chronic inflammation. We investigated whether ablation of P2RX7 attenuates the DMD model mouse phenotype to assess receptor suitability as a therapeutic target. Methods and Findings Using a combination of molecular, histological, and biochemical methods and behavioral analyses in vivo we demonstrate, to our knowledge for the first time, that genetic ablation of P2RX7 in the DMD model mouse produces a widespread functional attenuation of both muscle and non-muscle symptoms. In dystrophic muscles at 4 wk there was an evident recovery in key functional and molecular parameters such as improved muscle structure (minimum Feret diameter, p < 0.001), increased muscle strength in vitro (p < 0.001) and in vivo (p = 0.012), and pro-fibrotic molecular signatures. Serum creatine kinase (CK) levels were lower (p = 0.025), and reduced cognitive impairment (p = 0.006) and bone structure alterations (p < 0.001) were also apparent. Reduction of inflammation and fibrosis persisted at 20 mo in leg (p = 0.038), diaphragm (p = 0.042), and heart muscles (p < 0.001). We show that the amelioration of symptoms was proportional to the extent of receptor depletion and that improvements were observed following administration of two P2RX7 antagonists (CK, p = 0.030 and p = 0.050) without any detectable side effects. However, approaches successful in animal models still need to be proved effective in clinical practice. Conclusions These results are, to our knowledge, the first to establish that a single treatment can improve muscle function both short and long term and also correct cognitive impairment and bone loss in DMD model mice. The wide-ranging improvements reflect the convergence of P2RX7 ablation on multiple disease mechanisms affecting skeletal and cardiac muscles, inflammatory cells, brain, and bone. Given the impact of P2RX7 blockade in the DMD mouse model, this receptor is an attractive target for translational research: existing drugs with established safety records could potentially be repurposed for treatment of this lethal disease.","[Sinadinos, Anthony; Young, Christopher N.

We hypothesized that measuring the B-cell repertoire would enable assessment of the overall level of immunosuppression after heart transplantation. Methods and Findings In this proof-of-concept study, we implemented a molecular-barcode-based immune repertoire sequencing assay that sensitively and accurately measures the isotype and clonal composition of the circulating B cell repertoire. We used this assay to measure the temporal response of the B cell repertoire to immunosuppression after heart transplantation. We selected a subset of 12 participants from a larger prospective cohort study (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01985412) that is ongoing at Stanford Medical Center and for which enrollment started in March 2010. This subset of 12 participants was selected to represent post-heart-transplant events, with and without acute rejection (six participants with moderate-to-severe rejection and six without). We analyzed 130 samples from these patients, with an average follow-up period of 15 mo. Immune repertoire sequencing enables the measurement of a patient's net state of immunosuppression (correlation with tacrolimus level, r = -0.867, 95% CI -0.968 to -0.523, p = 0.0014), as well as the diagnosis of acute allograft rejection, which is preceded by increased immune activity with a sensitivity of 71.4% (95% CI 30.3% to 94.9%) and a specificity of 82.0% (95% CI 72.1% to 89.1%) (cell-free donor-derived DNA as noninvasive gold standard). To illustrate the potential of immune repertoire sequencing to monitor atypical post-transplant trajectories, we analyzed two more patients, one with chronic infections and one with amyloidosis. A larger, prospective study will be needed to validate the power of immune repertoire sequencing to predict rejection events, as this proof-of-concept study is limited to a small number of patients who were selected based on several criteria including the availability of a large number of samples and the absence or presence of rejection events. Conclusions If confirmed in larger, prospective studies, the method described here has potential applications in the tailored management of post-transplant immunosuppression and, more broadly, as a method for assessing the overall activity of the immune system.","[Vollmers, Christopher; De Vlaminck, Iwijn; Penland, Lolita; Quake, Stephen R.] Stanford Univ, Dept Bioengn, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Vollmers, Christopher; De Vlaminck, Iwijn; Penland, Lolita; Quake, Stephen R.] Stanford Univ, Dept Appl Phys, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [De Vlaminck, Iwijn; Quake, Stephen R.] Howard Hughes Med Inst, Stanford, CA USA; [Valantine, Hannah A.; Luikart, Helen; Strehl, Calvin; Cohen, Garrett; Khush, Kiran K.] Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Div Cardiovasc Med, Stanford, CA 94305 USA","Vollmers, C (reprint author), Stanford Univ, Dept Bioengn, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",kiran@stanford.edu; quake@stanford.edu,"De Vlaminck, Iwijn/P-6479-2015","De Vlaminck, Iwijn/0000-0001-6085-7311",National Institutes of Health (NIH) [RC4AI092673]; Howard Hughes Medical Institute,"This work was funded by National Institutes of Health (NIH) grant RC4AI092673 and the Howard Hughes Medical Institute.

This study aims to directly determine the contribution of relapses to the burden of P. vivax and P. ovale infection, illness, and transmission in Papua New Guinean children. Methods and Findings From 17 August 2009 to 20 May 2010, 524 children aged 5-10 y from East Sepik Province in Papua New Guinea (PNG) participated in a randomised double-blind placebo-controlled trial of blood-plus liver-stage drugs (chloroquine [CQ], 3 d; artemether-lumefantrine [AL], 3 d; and primaquine [PQ], 20 d, 10 mg/kg total dose) (261 children) or blood-stage drugs only (CQ, 3 d; AL, 3 d; and placebo [PL], 20 d) (263 children). Participants, study staff, and investigators were blinded to the treatment allocation. Twenty children were excluded during the treatment phase (PQ arm: 14, PL arm: 6), and 504 were followed actively for 9 mo. During the follow-up time, 18 children (PQ arm: 7, PL arm: 11) were lost to follow-up. Main primary and secondary outcome measures were time to first P. vivax infection (by qPCR), time to first clinical episode, force of infection, gametocyte positivity, and time to first P. ovale infection (by PCR). A basic stochastic transmission model was developed to estimate the potential effect of mass drug administration (MDA) for the prevention of recurrent P. vivax infections. Targeting hypnozoites through PQ treatment reduced the risk of having at least one qPCR-detectable P. vivax or P. ovale infection during 8 mo of follow-up (P. vivax: PQ arm 0.63/y versus PL arm 2.62/y, HR = 0.18 [95% CI 0.14, 0.25], p < 0.001; P. ovale: 0.06 versus 0.14, HR = 0.31 [95% CI 0.13, 0.77], p = 0.011) and the risk of having at least one clinical P. vivax episode (HR = 0.25 [95% CI 0.11, 0.61], p = 0.002). PQ also reduced the molecular force of P. vivax blood-stage infection in the first 3 mo of follow-up (PQ arm 1.90/y versus PL arm 7.75/y, incidence rate ratio [IRR] = 0.21 [95% CI 0.15, 0.28], p < 0.001). Children who received PQ were less likely to carry P. vivax gametocytes (IRR = 0.27 [95% CI 0.19, 0.38], p < 0.001). PQ had a comparable effect irrespective of the presence of P. vivax blood-stage infection at the time of treatment (p = 0.14). Modelling revealed that mass screening and treatment with highly sensitive quantitative real-time PCR, or MDA with blood-stage treatment alone, would have only a transient effect on P. vivax transmission levels, while MDA that includes liver-stage treatment is predicted to be a highly effective strategy for P. vivax elimination. The inclusion of a directly observed 20-d treatment regime maximises the efficiency of hypnozoite clearance but limits the generalisability of results to real-world MDA programmes. Conclusions These results suggest that relapses cause approximately four of every five P. vivax infections and at least three of every five P. ovale infections in PNG children and are important in sustaining transmission. MDA campaigns combining blood-and liver-stage treatment are predicted to be a highly efficacious intervention for reducing P. vivax and P. ovale transmission.","[Robinson, Leanne J.; Betuela, Inoni; Kinboro, Benson; Lorry, Lina; Tarongka, Nandao; Samol, Lornah] Papua New Guinea Inst Med Res, Vector Borne Dis Unit, Madang, Papua N Guinea; [Robinson, Leanne J.; Betuela, Inoni; Kinboro, Benson; Lorry, Lina; Tarongka, Nandao; Samol, Lornah] Papua New Guinea Inst Med Res, Vector Borne Dis Unit, Maprik, Papua N Guinea; [Robinson, Leanne J.; Karl, Stephan; Suen, Connie S.

Health risk assessment (HRA), a method successfully used in working-age populations, is a promising method for cost-effective health promotion and preventive care in older individuals, but the long-term effects of this approach are unknown. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of an innovative approach to HRA and counselling in older individuals for health behaviours, preventive care, and long-term survival. Methods and Findings This study was a pragmatic, single-centre randomised controlled clinical trial in community-dwelling individuals aged 65 y or older registered with one of 19 primary care physician (PCP) practices in a mixed rural and urban area in Switzerland. From November 2000 to January 2002, 874 participants were randomly allocated to the intervention and 1,410 to usual care. The intervention consisted of HRA based on self-administered questionnaires and individualised computer-generated feedback reports, combined with nurse and PCP counselling over a 2-y period. Primary outcomes were health behaviours and preventive care use at 2 y and all-cause mortality at 8 y. At baseline, participants in the intervention group had a mean +/- standard deviation of 6.9 +/- 3.7 risk factors (including unfavourable health behaviours, health and functional impairments, and social risk factors) and 4.3 +/- 1.8 deficits in recommended preventive care. At 2 y, favourable health behaviours and use of preventive care were more frequent in the intervention than in the control group (based on z-statistics from generalised estimating equation models). For example, 70% compared to 62% were physically active (odds ratio 1.43, 95% CI 1.16-1.77, p = 0.001), and 66% compared to 59% had influenza vaccinations in the past year (odds ratio 1.35, 95% CI 1.09-1.66, p = 0.005). At 8 y, based on an intention-to-treat analysis, the estimated proportion alive was 77.9% in the intervention and 72.8% in the control group, for an absolute mortality difference of 4.9% (95% CI 1.3%-8.5%, p = 0.009; based on z-test for risk difference). The hazard ratio of death comparing intervention with control was 0.79 (95% CI 0.66-0.94, p = 0.009; based on Wald test from Cox regression model), and the number needed to receive the intervention to prevent one death was 21 (95% CI 12-79). The main limitations of the study include the single-site study design, the use of a brief self-administered questionnaire for 2-y outcome data collection, the unavailability of other long-term outcome data (e.g., functional status, nursing home admissions), and the availability of long-term follow-up data on mortality for analysis only in 2014. Conclusions This is the first trial to our knowledge demonstrating that a collaborative care model of HRA in community-dwelling older people not only results in better health behaviours and increased use of recommended preventive care interventions, but also improves survival. The intervention tested in our study may serve as a model of how to implement a relatively low-cost but effective programme of disease prevention and health promotion in older individuals.","[Stuck, Andreas E.; Moser, Andre; Born, Stephan] Univ Hosp Bern, Dept Geriatr, Inselspital, CH-3010 Bern, Switzerland; [Stuck, Andreas E.; Moser, Andre; Born, Stephan] Univ Bern, Bern, Switzerland; [Moser, Andre; Gillmann, Gerhard; Zwahlen, Marcel; Egger, Matthias] Univ Bern, Inst Social & Prevent Med, Bern, Switzerland; [Morf, Ueli; Wirz, Urban; Wyser, Joseph] Univ Bern, Inst Primary Care, Bern, Switzerland; [Iliffe, Steve] UCL, Res Dept Primary Care & Populat Hlth, London, England; [Harari, Danielle] St Thomas Hosp, Dept Ageing & Hlth, London, England; [Swift, Cameron] Kings Coll London, Clin Age Res Unit, London, England; [Beck, John C.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA USA; [Beck, John C.] Langley Res Inst, Los Angeles, CA USA","Stuck, AE (reprint author), Univ Hosp Bern, Dept Geriatr, Inselspital, CH-3010 Bern, Switzerland.",andreas.stuck@insel.ch,"Iliffe, Steve/L-8379-2019","Moser, Andre/0000-0001-7178-6539; Zwahlen, Marcel/0000-0002-6772-6346; Egger, Matthias/0000-0001-7462-5132","European Union [QLK6-CT-1999-02205]; Federal Education and Science Ministry (Bern, Switzerland) [BBW 990311.1]; Swiss National Science Foundation [32-52804.97]; Swiss National Science Foundation Swiss National Cohort [0071, 3347CO-108806, 33CS30_134273, 33CS30_148415]; Swiss Foundation for Health Promotion [398]; Velux Foundation; Langley Research Institute","European Union (QLK6-CT-1999-02205) (AS SI CS); the Federal Education and Science Ministry (Bern, Switzerland, BBW 990311.1) (AS); the Swiss National Science Foundation (32-52804.97) (AS); the Swiss National Science Foundation Swiss National Cohort (projects 0071, 3347CO-108806, 33CS30_134273 and 33CS30_148415) (ME); the Swiss Foundation for Health Promotion (Project No. 398) (AS); the Velux Foundation (AS); the Langley Research Institute (JCB).

We hypothesised that the strategy would improve neonatal survival by around 15%. Methods and Findings In 2010 we trained 824 female volunteers to make three home visits to women and their families during pregnancy and two visits to them in the first few days of the infant's life in 65 wards, selected randomly from all 132 wards in six districts in Mtwara and Lindi regions, constituting typical rural areas in Southern Tanzania. The remaining wards were comparison areas. Participants were not blinded to the intervention. The primary analysis was an intention-to-treat analysis comparing the neonatal mortality (day 0-27) per 1,000 live births in intervention and comparison wards based on a representative survey in 185,000 households in 2013 with a response rate of 90%. We included 24,381 and 23,307 live births between July 2010 and June 2013 and 7,823 and 7,555 live births in the last year in intervention and comparison wards, respectively. We also compared changes in neonatal mortality and newborn care practices in intervention and comparison wards using baseline census data from 2007 including 225,000 households and 22,243 births in five of the six intervention districts. Amongst the 7,823 women with a live birth in the year prior to survey in intervention wards, 59% and 41% received at least one volunteer visit during pregnancy and postpartum, respectively. Neonatal mortality reduced from 35.0 to 30.5 deaths per 1,000 live births between 2007 and 2013 in the five districts, respectively. There was no evidence of an impact of the intervention on neonatal survival (odds ratio [OR] 1.1, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.9-1.2, p = 0.339). Newborn care practices reported by mothers were better in intervention than in comparison wards, including immediate breastfeeding (42% of 7,287 versus 35% of 7,008, OR 1.4, CI 1.3-1.6, p < 0.001), feeding only breast milk for the first 3 d (90% of 7,557 versus 79% of 7,307, OR 2.2, 95% CI 1.8-2.7, p < 0.001), and clean hands for home delivery (92% of 1,351 versus 88% of 1,799, OR 1.5, 95% CI 1.0-2.3, p = 0.033). Facility delivery improved dramatically in both groups from 41% of 22,243 in 2007 and was 82% of 7,820 versus 75% of 7,553 (OR 1.5, 95% CI 1.2-2.0, p = 0.002) in intervention and comparison wards in 2013. Methodological limitations include our inability to rule out some degree of leakage of the intervention into the comparison areas and response bias for newborn care behaviours. Conclusion Neonatal mortality remained high despite better care practices and childbirth in facilities becoming common.

A full cost-benefit analysis of workplace ART provision has not been conducted using primary data. We developed a dynamic health-state transition model to estimate the economic impact of HIV and the cost-benefit of ART provision in a mining company in South Africa between 2003 and 2022. Methods and Findings A dynamic health-state transition model, called the Workplace Impact Model (WIM), was parameterised with workplace data on workforce size, composition, turnover, HIV incidence, and CD4 cell count development. Bottom-up cost analyses from the employer perspective supplied data on inpatient and outpatient resource utilisation and the costs of absenteeism and replacement of sick workers. The model was fitted to workforce HIV prevalence and separation data while incorporating parameter uncertainty; univariate sensitivity analyses were used to assess the robustness of the model findings. As ART coverage increases from 10% to 97% of eligible employees, increases in survival and retention of HIV-positive employees and associated reductions in absenteeism and benefit payments lead to cost savings compared to a scenario of no treatment provision, with the annual cost of HIV to the company decreasing by 5% (90% credibility interval [CrI] 2%-8%) and the mean cost per HIV-positive employee decreasing by 14% (90% CrI 7%-19%) by 2022. This translates into an average saving of US$ 950,215 (90% CrI US$ 220,879-US$1.6 million) per year; 80% of these cost savings are due to reductions in benefit payments and inpatient care costs. Although findings are sensitive to assumptions regarding incidence and absenteeism, ART is cost-saving under considerable parameter uncertainty and in all tested scenarios, including when prevalence is reduced to 1%-except when no benefits were paid out to employees leaving the workforce and when absenteeism rates were half of what data suggested. Scaling up ART further through a universal test and treat strategy doubles savings; incorporating ART for family members reduces savings but is still marginally cost-saving compared to no treatment. Our analysis was limited to the direct cost of HIV to companies and did not examine the impact of HIV prevention policies on the miners or their families, and a few model inputs were based on limited data, though in sensitivity analysis our results were found to be robust to changes to these inputs along plausible ranges. Conclusions Workplace ART provision can be cost-saving for companies in high HIV prevalence settings due to reductions in healthcare costs, absenteeism, and staff turnover. Company-sponsored HIV counselling and voluntary testing with ensuing treatment of all HIV-positive employees and family members should be implemented universally at workplaces in countries with high HIV prevalence.","[Meyer-Rath, Gesine] London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, Dept Hlth Serv Res & Policy, London WC1, England; [Meyer-Rath, Gesine] Boston Univ, Ctr Global Hlth & Dev, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Meyer-Rath, Gesine] Univ Witwatersrand, Fac Hlth Sci, Dept Internal Med, Hlth Econ & Epidemiol Res Off, Johannesburg, South Africa; [Pienaar, Jan] Anglo Amer Coal, Highveld Hosp, Emalahleni, South Africa; [Brink, Brian] Anglo Amer, Johannesburg, South Africa; [van Zyl, Andrew; Muirhead, Debbie; Churchyard, Gavin] Aurum Inst, Johannesburg, South Africa; [Grant, Alison; Churchyard, Gavin] London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, Dept Clin Res, London WC1, England; [Watts, Charlotte] London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, Dept Global Hlth & Dev, London WC1, England; [Vickerman, Peter] Univ Bristol, Sch Social & Community Med, Bristol, Avon, England","Meyer-Rath, G (reprint author), London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, Dept Hlth Serv Res & Policy, London WC1, England.",gesine@bu.edu,,"Vickerman, Peter/0000-0002-8291-5890",GlaxoSmithKline; Anglo American,"Funding for this study was obtained through a grant by GlaxoSmithKline to the Aurum Institute and direct funding from Anglo American.

Methods and Findings From Swedish national registers we extracted information on 856,493 individuals who were prescribed SSRIs, and subsequent violent crimes during 2006 through 2009. We used stratified Cox regression analyses to compare the rate of violent crime while individuals were prescribed these medications with the rate in the same individuals while not receiving medication. Adjustments were made for other psychotropic medications. Information on all medications was extracted from the Swedish Prescribed Drug Register, with complete national data on all dispensed medications. Information on violent crime convictions was extracted from the Swedish national crime register. Using within-individual models, there was an overall association between SSRIs and violent crime convictions (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.19, 95% CI 1.08-1.32, p < 0.001, absolute risk = 1.0%). With age stratification, there was a significant association between SSRIs and violent crime convictions for individuals aged 15 to 24 y (HR = 1.43, 95% CI 1.19-1.73, p < 0.001, absolute risk = 3.0%). However, there were no significant associations in those aged 25-34 y (HR = 1.20, 95% CI 0.95-1.52, p = 0.125, absolute risk = 1.6%), in those aged 35-44 y (HR = 1.06, 95% CI 0.83-1.35, p = 0.666, absolute risk = 1.2%), or in those aged 45 y or older (HR = 1.07, 95% CI 0.84-1.35, p = 0.594, absolute risk = 0.3%). Associations in those aged 15 to 24 y were also found for violent crime arrests with preliminary investigations (HR = 1.28, 95% CI 1.16-1.41, p < 0.001), non-violent crime convictions (HR = 1.22, 95% CI 1.10-1.34, p < 0.001), non-violent crime arrests (HR = 1.13, 95% CI 1.07-1.20, p < 0.001), non-fatal injuries from accidents (HR = 1.29, 95% CI 1.22-1.36, p < 0.001), and emergency inpatient or outpatient treatment for alcohol intoxication or misuse (HR = 1.98, 95% CI 1.76-2.21, p < 0.001). With age and sex stratification, there was a significant association between SSRIs and violent crime convictions for males aged 15 to 24 y (HR = 1.40, 95% CI 1.13-1.73, p = 0.002) and females aged 15 to 24 y (HR = 1.75, 95% CI 1.08-2.84, p = 0.023). However, there were no significant associations in those aged 25 y or older. One important limitation is that we were unable to fully account for time-varying factors. Conclusions The association between SSRIs and violent crime convictions and violent crime arrests varied by age group. The increased risk we found in young people needs validation in other studies.","[Molero, Yasmina; Gumpert, Clara Hellner] Karolinska Inst, Ctr Psychiat Res, Dept Clin Neurosci, Stockholm, Sweden; [Lichtenstein, Paul; Zetterqvist, Johan] Karolinska Inst, Dept Med Epidemiol & Biostat, Stockholm, Sweden; [Fazel, Seena] Univ Oxford, Warneford Hosp, Dept Psychiat, Oxford, England","Molero, Y (reprint author), Karolinska Inst, Ctr Psychiat Res, Dept Clin Neurosci, Stockholm, Sweden.",seena.fazel@psych.ox.ac.uk,"; Fazel, Seena/B-5307-2008","Molero, Yasmina/0000-0002-5663-2010; Fazel, Seena/0000-0002-5383-5365",Wellcome Trust [095806]; Karolinska Institutet; Swedish Research Council,"SF is supported by the Wellcome Trust [095806].

However, based on nutrient composition, some particular fruits and vegetables may be more or less beneficial for maintaining or achieving a healthy weight. We hypothesized that greater consumption of fruits and vegetables with a higher fiber content or lower glycemic load would be more strongly associated with a healthy weight. Methods and Findings We examined the association between change in intake of specific fruits and vegetables and change in weight in three large, prospective cohorts of 133,468 United States men and women. From 1986 to 2010, these associations were examined within multiple 4-y time intervals, adjusting for simultaneous changes in other lifestyle factors, including other aspects of diet, smoking status, and physical activity. Results were combined using a random effects meta-analysis. Increased intake of fruits was inversely associated with 4-y weight change: total fruits -0.53 lb per daily serving (95% CI - 0.61, -0.44), berries -1.11 lb (95% CI - 1.45, -0.78), and apples/pears -1.24 lb (95% CI - 1.62, -0.86). Increased intake of several vegetables was also inversely associated with weight change: total vegetables -0.25 lb per daily serving (95% CI - 0.35, -0.14), tofu/soy -2.47 lb (95% CI, -3.09 to -1.85 lb) and cauliflower -1.37 lb (95% CI - 2.27, -0.47). On the other hand, increased intake of starchy vegetables, including corn, peas, and potatoes, was associated with weight gain. Vegetables having both higher fiber and lower glycemic load were more strongly inversely associated with weight change compared with lower-fiber, higher-glycemic-load vegetables (p < 0.0001). Despite the measurement of key confounders in our analyses, the potential for residual confounding cannot be ruled out, and although our food frequency questionnaire specified portion size, the assessment of diet using any method will have measurement error. Conclusions Increased consumption of fruits and non-starchy vegetables is inversely associated with weight change, with important differences by type suggesting that other characteristics of these foods influence the magnitude of their association with weight change.","[Bertoia, Monica L.; Mukamal, Kenneth J.; Cahill, Leah E.; Ludwig, David S.; Mozaffarian, Dariush; Willett, Walter C.; Hu, Frank B.; Rimm, Eric B.] Harvard Univ, TH Chan Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Nutr, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Bertoia, Monica L.; Mozaffarian, Dariush; Willett, Walter C.; Hu, Frank B.; Rimm, Eric B.] Harvard Univ, Brigham & Womens Hosp, Sch Med, Dept Med,Channing Div Network Med, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Mukamal, Kenneth J.] Beth Israel Deaconess Med Ctr, Dept Med, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Hou, Tao; Mozaffarian, Dariush; Willett, Walter C.; Hu, Frank B.; Rimm, Eric B.] Harvard Univ, TH Chan Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Epidemiol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Ludwig, David S.] Boston Childrens Hosp, New Balance Fdn Obes Prevent Ctr, Boston, MA USA; [Mozaffarian, Dariush] Brigham & Womens Hosp, Div Cardiovasc Med, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Mozaffarian, Dariush] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Mozaffarian, Dariush] Tufts Univ, Friedman Sch Nutr Sci & Policy, Boston, MA 02111 USA","Bertoia, ML (reprint author), Harvard Univ, TH Chan Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Nutr, Boston, MA 02115 USA.",mbertoia@hsph.harvard.edu,,"Cahill, Leah/0000-0003-3584-2227; Ludwig, David/0000-0003-3307-8544","National Institutes of Health [P01 CA87969, R01 CA49449, R01 HL034594, R01 HL088521, UM1 CA176726, R01 CA67262, UM1 CA167552, R01 HL35464, K24DK082730]","This study was supported by grants P01 CA87969, R01 CA49449, R01 HL034594, R01 HL088521, UM1 CA176726, R01 CA67262, UM1 CA167552, R01 HL35464, and K24DK082730 from the National Institutes of Health.

We investigated a novel alternative based on HIV self-testing (HIVST). The aim was to evaluate the uptake of testing, accuracy, linkage into care, and health outcomes when highly convenient and flexible but supported access to HIVST kits was provided to a well-defined and closely monitored population. Methods and Findings Following enumeration of 14 neighbourhoods in urban Blantyre, Malawi, trained resident volunteer-counsellors offered oral HIVST kits (OraQuick ADVANCE Rapid HIV-1/2 Anti-body Test) to adult (>= 16 y old) residents (n = 16,660) and reported community events, with all deaths investigated by verbal autopsy. Written and demonstrated instructions, pre- and post-test counselling, and facilitated HIV care assessment were provided, with a request to return kits and a self-completed questionnaire. Accuracy, residency, and a study-imposed requirement to limit HIVST to one test per year were monitored by home visits in a systematic quality assurance (QA) sample. Overall, 14,004 (crude uptake 83.8%, revised to 76.5% to account for population turnover) residents self-tested during months 1-12, with adolescents (16-19 y) most likely to test. 10,614/14,004 (75.8%) participants shared results with volunteer-counsellors. Of 1,257 (11.8%) HIV-positive participants, 26.0% were already on antiretroviral therapy, and 524 (linkage 56.3%) newly accessed care with a median CD4 count of 250 cells/mu l (interquartile range 159-426). HIVST uptake in months 13-24 was more rapid (70.9% uptake by 6 mo), with fewer (7.3%, 95% CI 6.8%-7.8%) positive participants. Being ""forced to test"", usually by a main partner, was reported by 2.9% (95% CI 2.6%-3.2%) of 10,017 questionnaire respondents in months 1-12, but satisfaction with HIVST (94.4%) remained high. No HIVST-related partner violence or suicides were reported. HIVST and repeat HTC results agreed in 1,639/1,649 systematically selected (1 in 20) QA participants (99.4%), giving a sensitivity of 93.6% (95% CI 88.2%-97.0%) and a specificity of 99.9% (95% CI 99.6%-100%). Key limitations included use of aggregate data to report uptake of HIVST and being unable to adjust for population turnover. Conclusions Community-based HIVST achieved high coverage in two successive years and was safe, accurate, and acceptable. Proactive HIVST strategies, supported and monitored by communities, could substantially complement existing approaches to providing early HIV diagnosis and periodic repeat testing to adolescents and adults in high-HIV settings.","[Choko, Augustine T.; Feasy, Helena; Sambakunsi, Rodrick; Mdolo, Aaron; Desmond, Nicola; Maheswaran, Hendramoorthy; Corbett, Elizabeth L.] Malawi Liverpool Wellcome Trust Clin Res Programm, Blantyre, Malawi; [MacPherson, Peter; Desmond, Nicola] Univ Liverpool, Dept Publ Hlth & Policy, Liverpool L69 3BX, Merseyside, England; [MacPherson, Peter] Univ Liverpool, Liverpool Sch Trop Med, Dept Clin Sci, Liverpool L3 5QA, Merseyside, England; [Webb, Emily L.; Willey, Barbara A.; Hayes, Richard; Corbett, Elizabeth L.] London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, Liverpool, Merseyside, England; [Makombe, Simon D.] Minist Hlth, HIV Unit, Lilongwe, Malawi; [Maheswaran, Hendramoorthy] Warwick Med Sch, Div Hlth Sci, Coventry, W Midlands, England","Choko, AT (reprint author), Malawi Liverpool Wellcome Trust Clin Res Programm, Blantyre, Malawi.",augutc@gmail.com,,"Feasey, Helena/0000-0003-3109-6722; Desmond, Nicola/0000-0002-2874-8569; Maheswaran, Hendramoorthy/0000-0002-7375-4845; Corbett, Elizabeth/0000-0002-3552-3181; MacPherson, Peter/0000-0002-0329-9613",Wellcome Trust Senior Research Fellowship in Clinical Science [WT091769]; Medical Research Council [MR/K012126/1],"The study was funded as part of a Wellcome Trust Senior Research Fellowship in Clinical Science (grant number: WT091769) awarded to ELC.

This is exemplified by the largest global outbreak of extensively drug-resistant (XDR) tuberculosis (TB) identified in Tugela Ferry, KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, in 2005 that continues today. It is unclear whether the emergence of XDR-TB in KwaZulu-Natal was due to recent inadequacies in TB control in conjunction with HIV or other factors. Understanding the origins of drug resistance in this fatal outbreak of XDR will inform the control and prevention of drug-resistant TB in other settings. In this study, we used whole genome sequencing and dating analysis to determine if XDR-TB had emerged recently or had ancient antecedents. Methods and Findings We performed whole genome sequencing and drug susceptibility testing on 337 clinical isolates of Mycobacterium tuberculosis collected in KwaZulu-Natal from 2008 to 2013, in addition to three historical isolates, collected from patients in the same province and including an isolate from the 2005 Tugela Ferry XDR outbreak, a multidrug-resistant (MDR) isolate from 1994, and a pansusceptible isolate from 1995. We utilized an array of whole genome comparative techniques to assess the relatedness among strains, to establish the order of acquisition of drug resistance mutations, including the timing of acquisitions leading to XDR-TB in the LAM4 spoligotype, and to calculate the number of independent evolutionary emergences of MDR and XDR. Our sequencing and analysis revealed a 50-member clone of XDR M. tuberculosis that was highly related to the Tugela Ferry XDR outbreak strain. We estimated that mutations conferring isoniazid and streptomycin resistance in this clone were acquired 50 y prior to the Tugela Ferry outbreak (katG S315T [isoniazid]; gidB 130 bp deletion [streptomycin]; 1957 [95% highest posterior density (HPD): 1937-1971]), with the subsequent emergence of MDR and XDR occurring 20 y (rpoB L452P [rifampicin]; pncA 1 bp insertion [pyrazinamide]; 1984 [95% HPD: 1974-1992]) and 10 y (rpoB D435G [rifampicin]; rrs 1400 [kanamycin]; gyrA A90V [ofloxacin]; 1995 [95% HPD: 1988-1999]) prior to the outbreak, respectively. We observed frequent de novo evolution of MDR and XDR, with 56 and nine independent evolutionary events, respectively. Isoniazid resistance evolved before rifampicin resistance 46 times, whereas rifampicin resistance evolved prior to isoniazid only twice. We identified additional putative compensatory mutations to rifampicin in this dataset. One major limitation of this study is that the conclusions with respect to ordering and timing of acquisition of mutations may not represent universal patterns of drug resistance emergence in other areas of the globe. Conclusions In the first whole genome-based analysis of the emergence of drug resistance among clinical isolates of M. tuberculosis, we show that the ancestral precursor of the LAM4 XDR outbreak strain in Tugela Ferry gained mutations to first-line drugs at the beginning of the antibiotic era. Subsequent accumulation of stepwise resistance mutations, occurring over decades and prior to the explosion of HIV in this region, yielded MDR and XDR, permitting the emergence of compensatory mutations. Our results suggest that drug-resistant strains circulating today reflect not only vulnerabilities of current TB control efforts but also those that date back 50 y. In drug-resistant TB, isoniazid resistance was overwhelmingly the initial resistance mutation to be acquired, which would not be detected by current rapid molecular diagnostics employed in South Africa that assess only rifampicin resistance.","[Cohen, Keira A.] Harvard Univ, Brigham & Womens Hosp, Sch Med, Div Pulm & Crit Care Med, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Cohen, Keira A.; Munsamy, Vanisha; Almeida, Deepak V.; Duffy, Eamon Y.; Govender, Pamla; Maharaj, Kashmeel; Grosset, Jacques; Pym, Alexander S.] KwaZulu Natal Res Inst TB & HIV K RITH, Durban, South Africa; [Abeel, Thomas; McGuire, Abigail Manson; Desjardins, Christopher A.; Shea, Terrance P.; Walker, Bruce J.; Alvarado, Lucia; Chapman, Sinead B.; Fitzgerald, Michael G.; Gujja, Sharvari; Hamilton, Susanna; Howarth, Clinton; Larimer, Jeffrey D.; Pearson, Matthew D.; Priest, Margaret E.; Zeng, Qiandong; Young, Sarah K.; Wortman, Jennifer; Birren, Bruce W.; Earl, Ashlee M.] Broad Inst MIT & Harvard, Cambridge, MA USA; [Abeel, Thomas] Delft Univ Technol, Delft Bioinformat Lab, Delft, Netherlands; [Bantubani, Nonkqubela] MRC, Durban, South Africa; [Almeida, Deepak V.; Grosset, Jacques; Bishai, William R.] Johns Hopkins Sch Med, Ctr TB Res, Baltimore, MD USA; [Mvelase, Nomonde R.; Mlisana, Koleka P.] Univ KwaZulu Natal, Sch Lab Med & Med Sci, Durban, South Africa; [Mvelase, Nomonde R.; Mlisana, Koleka P.] Natl Hlth Lab Serv, Durban, South Africa; [Padayatchi, Nesri; O'Donnell, Max R.] Ctr AIDS Programme Res South Africa CAPRISA, Durban, South Africa; [O'Donnell, Max R.] Columbia Univ, Coll Phys & Surg, Div Pulm Allergy & Crit Care Med, New York, NY USA; [O'Donnell, Max R.] Columbia Mailman Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Epidemiol, New York, NY USA","Cohen, KA (reprint author), Harvard Univ, Brigham & Womens Hosp, Sch Med, Div Pulm & Crit Care Med, Boston, MA 02115 USA.",alex.pym@k-rith.org; aearl@broadinstitute.org,"Cohen, Keira/S-8617-2018; Manson, Abigail/B-7132-2016; padayatchi, nesri/Q-2780-2019","Cohen, Keira/0000-0002-4521-397X; Manson, Abigail/0000-0002-3800-0714; padayatchi, nesri/0000-0003-2543-9071; Pym, Alexander/0000-0002-6260-8180; Abeel, Thomas/0000-0002-7205-7431; Earl, Ashlee/0000-0001-7857-9145","National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Contract [HHSN272200900018C, U19AI110818, K23 AI098479-01A1, U19 AI51794]; National Heart, Blood, and Lung Institute [T32HL007633]; Stony Wold-Herbert Foundation; US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention","National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Contract No.: HHSN272200900018C and Grant Number U19AI110818 to TA AMM CAD TS BJW LA SC MGF SG SH CH JDL MDP MEP QZ SKY JW BWB AME; K23 AI098479-01A1 to MRO; U19 AI51794 to NP and MRO; National Heart, Blood, and Lung Institute T32HL007633 to KAC; Stony Wold-Herbert Foundation to MRO; US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to ASP.

We assessed the effectiveness of text messaging and medication monitors to improve medication adherence in TB patients. Methods and Findings In a pragmatic cluster-randomised trial, 36 districts/counties (each with at least 300 active pulmonary TB patients registered in 2009) within the provinces of Heilongjiang, Jiangsu, Hunan, and Chongqing, China, were randomised using stratification and restriction to one of four case-management approaches in which patients received reminders via text messages, a medication monitor, combined, or neither (control). Patients in the intervention arms received reminders to take their drugs and reminders for monthly follow-up visits, and the managing doctor was recommended to switch patients with adherence problems to more intensive management or DOT. In all arms, patients took medications out of a medication monitor box, which recorded when the box was opened, but the box gave reminders only in the medication monitor and combined arms. Patients were followed up for 6 mo. The primary endpoint was the percentage of patient-months on TB treatment where at least 20% of doses were missed as measured by pill count and failure to open the medication monitor box. Secondary endpoints included additional adherence and standard treatment outcome measures. Interventions were not masked to study staff and patients. From 1 June 2011 to 7 March 2012, 4,292 new pulmonary TB patients were enrolled across the 36 clusters. A total of 119 patients (by arm: 33 control, 33 text messaging, 23 medication monitor, 30 combined) withdrew from the study in the first month because they were reassessed as not having TB by their managing doctor (61 patients) or were switched to a different treatment model because of hospitalisation or travel (58 patients), leaving 4,173 TB patients (by arm: 1,104 control, 1,008 text messaging, 997 medication monitor, 1,064 combined). The cluster geometric mean of the percentage of patient-months on TB treatment where at least 20% of doses were missed was 29.9% in the control arm; in comparison, this percentage was 27.3% in the text messaging arm (adjusted mean ratio [aMR] 0.94, 95% CI 0.71, 1.24), 17.0% in the medication monitor arm (aMR 0.58, 95% CI 0.42, 0.79), and 13.9% in the combined arm (aMR 0.49, 95% CI 0.27, 0.88). Patient loss to follow-up was lower in the text messaging arm than the control arm (aMR 0.42, 95% CI 0.18-0.98). Equipment malfunction or operation error was reported in all study arms. Analyses separating patients with and without medication monitor problems did not change the results. Initiation of intensive management was underutilised. Conclusions This study is the first to our knowledge to utilise a randomised trial design to demonstrate the effectiveness of a medication monitor to improve medication adherence in TB patients. Reminders from medication monitors improved medication adherence in TB patients, but text messaging reminders did not. In a setting such as China where universal use of DOT is not feasible, innovative approaches to support patients in adhering to TB treatment, such as this, are needed.","[Liu, Xiaoqiu; Zhang, Hui; Li, Jun; Li, Xue; Chen, Hongguang; Liu, Mingming; Chen, Rong; Chi, Junying; Cheng, Shiming; Wang, Lixia; Jiang, Shiwen] Chinese Ctr Dis Control & Prevent, Natl Ctr TB Control & Prevent, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Lewis, James J.; Fielding, Katherine L.] London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, MRC Trop Epidemiol Grp, London WC1, England; [Lu, Wei] Jiangsu Prov Ctr Dis Control & Prevent, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Shun] Chongqing Prov TB Dispensary, Chongqing, Chongqing, Peoples R China; [Zheng, Guilan] Heilongjiang Prov TB Dispensary, Harbin, Heilongjiang, Peoples R China; [Bai, Liqiong] Hunan Prov TB Dispensary, Changsha, Hunan, Peoples R China; [Lu, Jian] Dafeng Cty Ctr Dis Control & Prevent, Dafeng, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Huan, Shitong; Chin, Daniel P.] Bill & Melinda Gates Fdn, China Off, Beijing, Peoples R China","Liu, XQ (reprint author), Chinese Ctr Dis Control & Prevent, Natl Ctr TB Control & Prevent, Beijing, Peoples R China.",jiangsw@chinatb.org,"Lewis, James/F-6333-2013","Lewis, James/0000-0002-8603-2761","Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation [51914]; Medical Research Council [MR/K007467/1, MR/K012126/1]","The study was funded by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, grant number 51914 (http://www.gatesfoundation.org/).

Most morbidity is caused by metastases that remain incurable to date. TGF-beta 1 has been identified as a key driving force behind metastatic breast cancer, with promising therapeutic implications. Methods and Findings Employing immunohistochemistry (IHC) analysis, we report, to our knowledge for the first time, that asporin is overexpressed in the stroma of most human breast cancers and is not expressed in normal breast tissue. In vitro, asporin is secreted by breast fibroblasts upon exposure to conditioned medium from some but not all human breast cancer cells. While hormone receptor (HR) positive cells cause strong asporin expression, triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells suppress it. Further, our findings show that soluble IL-1 beta, secreted by TNBC cells, is responsible for inhibiting asporin in normal and cancer-associated fibroblasts. Using recombinant protein, as well as a synthetic peptide fragment, we demonstrate the ability of asporin to inhibit TGF-beta 1-mediated SMAD2 phosphorylation, epithelial to mesenchymal transition, and stemness in breast cancer cells. In two in vivo murine models of TNBC, we observed that tumors expressing asporin exhibit significantly reduced growth (2-fold; p = 0.01) and metastatic properties (3-fold; p = 0.045). A retrospective IHC study performed on human breast carcinoma (n = 180) demonstrates that asporin expression is lowest in TNBC and HER2+ tumors, while HR+ tumors have significantly higher asporin expression (4-fold; p = 0.001). Assessment of asporin expression and patient outcome (n = 60; 10-y follow-up) shows that low protein levels in the primary breast lesion significantly delineate patients with bad outcome regardless of the tumor HR status (area under the curve = 0.87; 95% CI 0.78-0.96; p = 0.0001). Survival analysis, based on gene expression (n = 375; 25-y follow-up), confirmed that low asporin levels are associated with a reduced likelihood of survival (hazard ratio = 0.58; 95% CI 0.37-0.91; p = 0.017). Although these data highlight the potential of asporin to serve as a prognostic marker, confirmation of the clinical value would require a prospective study on a much larger patient cohort. Conclusions Our data show that asporin is a stroma-derived inhibitor of TGF-beta 1 and a tumor suppressor in breast cancer. High asporin expression is significantly associated with less aggressive tumors, stratifying patients according to the clinical outcome. Future pre-clinical studies should consider options for increasing asporin expression in TNBC as a promising strategy for targeted therapy.","[Maris, Pamela; Blomme, Arnaud; Palacios, Ana Perez; Costanza, Brunella; Bellahcene, Akeila; Trombino, Giovanna Elvi; Castronovo, Vincent; Turtoi, Andrei] Univ Liege, GIGA Canc, Metastasis Res Lab, Liege, Belgium; [Bianchi, Elettra; Delvenne, Philippe] Univ Liege, Univ Hosp Liege, Dept Pathol, Liege, Belgium; [Gofflot, Stephanie] Univ Liege, Biotheque, Liege, Belgium; [Drion, Pierre] Univ Liege, GIGA Cardiovasc Sci, Anim Facil, Liege, Belgium; [Trombino, Giovanna Elvi] Univ Calabria, Dept Pharm & Hlth & Nutr Sci, I-87036 Cosenza, Italy; [Di Valentin, Emmanuel] Univ Liege, GIGA Viral Vectors Platform, Liege, Belgium; [Cusumano, Pino G.; Lifrange, Eric] Univ Liege, Univ Hosp Liege, Dept Senol, Liege, Belgium; [Maweja, Sylvie] Univ Liege, Dept Abdominal Surg, Liege, Belgium; [Jerusalem, Guy] Univ Liege, Univ Hosp Liege, Dept Med Oncol, Liege, Belgium","Maris, P (reprint author), Univ Liege, GIGA Canc, Metastasis Res Lab, Liege, Belgium.",vcastronovo@ulg.ac.be; a.turtoi@ulg.ac.be,,,University of Liege; EU [HEALTH-F2-2007-201342]; National Fund for Scientific Research (FNRS),"This work was supported with grants from the University of Liege (Concerted Research Action Program [IDEA project]), EU (FP7 network: ADAMANT-Antibody Derivatives As Molecular Agents for Neoplastic Targeting (HEALTH-F2-2007-201342)), and from the National Fund for Scientific Research (FNRS).

In the ""post-intervention 2012"" (from July 2012 to June 2013) and ""post-intervention 2013"" (from July 2013 to June 2014) phases, patients who screened HIV-positive at the same facilities were offered a simplified test and treat intervention, i.e., concurrent HIV confirmatory and CD4 testing and immediate initiation of ART, irrespective of CD4 count. Participants were followed for 6-18 mo until the end of their study phase period. Mortality rates in the pre-intervention and post-intervention phases were compared for all HIV cases and for treatment-eligible HIV cases. A total of 1,034 HIV-positive participants (281 and 339 in the two pre-intervention phases respectively, and 215 and 199 in the two post-intervention phases respectively) were enrolled. Following the structural intervention, receipt of baseline CD4 testing within 30 d of HIV confirmation increased from 67%/61% (pre-intervention 2010/pre-intervention 2011) to 98%/97% (post-intervention 2012/post-intervention 2013) (all p < 0.001 [i.e., for all comparisons between a pre- and post-intervention phase]), and the time from HIV confirmation to ART initiation decreased from 53 d (interquartile range [IQR] 27-141)/43 d (IQR 15-113) to 5 d (IQR 2-12)/5 d (IQR 2-13) (all p < 0.001). Initiation of ART increased from 27%/49% to 91%/89% among all cases (all p < 0.001) and from 39%/62% to 94%/90% among individuals with CD4 count <= 350 cells/mm(3) or AIDS (all p < 0.001). Mortality decreased from 27%/27% to 10%/10% for all cases (all p < 0.001) and from 40%/35% to 13%/13% for cases with CD4 count <= 350 cells/mm(3) or AIDS (all p < 0.001). The simplified test and treat intervention was significantly associated with decreased mortality rates compared to pre-intervention 2011 (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 0.385 [95% CI 0.239-0.620] and 0.380 [95% CI 0.233-0.618] for the two post-intervention phases, respectively, for all newly diagnosed HIV cases [both p < 0.001], and aHR 0.369 [95% CI 0.226-0.603] and 0.361 [95% CI 0.221-0.590] for newly diagnosed treatment-eligible HIV cases [both p < 0.001]). The unit cost of an additional patient receiving ART attributable to the intervention was US$83.80. The unit cost of a death prevented because of the intervention was US$234.52. Conclusions Our results demonstrate that the simplified HIV test and treat intervention promoted successful engagement in care and was associated with a 62% reduction in mortality. Our findings support the implementation of integrated HIV testing and immediate access to ART irrespective of CD4 count, in order to optimize the impact of ART.","[Wu, Zunyou; Zhao, Yan; Mao, Yurong; Shi, Cynthia X.; Zhang, Mingjie; Jin, Xia; Li, Jian] Chinese Ctr Dis Control & Prevent, Natl Ctr AIDS STD Control & Prevent, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Ge, Xianmin; Chen, Chi] Guangxi Hlth Dept, Guangxi Bur HIV AIDS, Nanning, Peoples R China; [Tang, Zhenzhu; Shen, Zhiyong] Guangxi Ctr Dis Control & Prevent, Nanning, Peoples R China; [Li, Yong] Guangxi Antiretroviral Treatment Ctr, Liuzhou, Peoples R China; [Qiu, Xuejun] Zhongshan Cty Hlth Bur, Zhongshan, Peoples R China; [Nong, Guide] Zhongshan Cty Ctr Dis Control & Prevent, Zhongshan, Peoples R China; [Huang, Shanhui] Zhongshan Cty Gen Hosp,Zhongshan, Zhongshan, Peoples R China; [Luo, Shen] Pubei Cty Hlth Bur, Pubei, Peoples R China; [Wu, Shaohui] Pubei Cty Ctr Dis Control & Prevent, Pubei, Peoples R China; [He, Wenzhen] Pubei Cty Gen Hosp, Pubei, Peoples R China; [Brookmeyer, Ron] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Fielding Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Biostat, Los Angeles, CA USA; [Detels, Roger] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Fielding Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Epidemiol, Los Angeles, CA USA; [Montaner, Julio] Univ British Columbia, BC Ctr Excellence HIV AIDS, Vancouver, BC V5Z 1M9, Canada; [Wang, Yu] Chinese Ctr Dis Control & Prevent, Beijing, Peoples R China","Wu, ZY (reprint author), Chinese Ctr Dis Control & Prevent, Natl Ctr AIDS STD Control & Prevent, Beijing, Peoples R China.",wuzy@263.net; wangyu@chinacdc.cn,,,"China National AIDS Program from the National Health and Family Planning Commission of the People's Republic of China [131-14-000-105-01, 2012ZX10001007]; AbbVie","It was supported by China National AIDS Program from the National Health and Family Planning Commission of the People's Republic of China (grant number: 131-14-000-105-01; 2012ZX10001007) and by the AbbVie.

Even in an era of more tolerable and efficacious ART, decision making in regards to ART offer and uptake remains complex and calls for exploration of both patient and provider perspectives. We sought to understand reasons for lack of ART usage in patients meeting the Health Resources Services Administration definition of retention as well as what motivated HIV primary care appointment attendance in the absence of ART. Methods and Findings We conducted a qualitative study consisting of 70 in-depth interviews with ART-naive and ART-experienced patients off ART and their primary care providers in two urban safety-net HIV clinics in San Francisco and New York. Twenty patients and their providers were interviewed separately at baseline, and 15 dyads were interviewed again after at least 3 mo and another clinic visit in order to understand any ART use in the interim. We applied dyadic analysis to our data. Nearly all patients were willing to consider ART, and 40% of the sample went on ART, citing education on newer antiretroviral drugs, acceptance of HIV diagnosis, social support, and increased confidence in their ability to adhere as facilitators. However, the strength of the provider recommendation of ART played an important role. Many patients had internalized messages from providers that their health was too good to warrant ART. In addition, providers, while demonstrating patient-centered care through sensitivity to patients experiencing psychosocial instability, frequently muted the offer of ART, at times unintentionally. In the absence of ART, lab monitoring, provider relationships, access to social services, opiate pain medications, and acute symptoms motivated care. The main limitations of this study were that treatment as prevention was not explored in depth and that participants were recruited from academic HIV clinics in the US, making the findings most generalizable to this setting. Conclusions Provider communication with regard to ART is a key focus for further exploration and intervention in order to increase ART uptake for those retained in HIV care.","[Christopoulos, Katerina A.; Lopez, Andrea M.; Geng, Elvin; Koester, Kimberly A.] Univ Calif San Francisco, San Francisco Gen Hosp, Div HIV AIDS, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; [Olender, Susan] Columbia Univ, Med Ctr, Comprehens HIV Program, New York, NY USA; [Lekas, Helen-Maria; Jaiswal, Jessica; Mellman, Will] Columbia Univ, Mailman Sch Publ Hlth, Div Sociomed Sci, New York, NY USA; [Koester, Kimberly A.] Univ Calif San Francisco, Ctr AIDS Prevent Studies, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA","Christopoulos, KA (reprint author), Univ Calif San Francisco, San Francisco Gen Hosp, Div HIV AIDS, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA.",christopoulosk@php.ucsf.edu,,,Bristol Myers Squibb [AI424-484]; National Institutes of Health [K23 MH092220],"Bristol Myers Squibb provided the investigator-initiated financial support that made this study possible through grant AI424-484 (KAC).

Improved hypertension control in China would result in result in enormous health gains in the world's largest population. A computer simulation model projected the cost-effectiveness of hypertension treatment in Chinese adults, assuming a range of essential medicines list drug costs. Methods and Findings The Cardiovascular Disease Policy Model-China, a Markov-style computer simulation model, simulated hypertension screening, essential medicines program implementation, hypertension control program administration, drug treatment and monitoring costs, disease-related costs, and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained by preventing cardiovascular disease or lost because of drug side effects in untreated hypertensive adults aged 35-84 y over 2015-2025. Cost-effectiveness was assessed in cardiovascular disease patients (secondary prevention) and for two blood pressure ranges in primary prevention (stage one, 140-159/90-99 mm Hg; stage two, >= 160/>= 100 mm Hg). Treatment of isolated systolic hypertension and combined systolic and diastolic hypertension were modeled as a reduction in systolic blood pressure; treatment of isolated diastolic hypertension was modeled as a reduction in diastolic blood pressure. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses explored ranges of antihypertensive drug effectiveness and costs, monitoring frequency, medication adherence, side effect severity, background hypertension prevalence, antihypertensive medication treatment, case fatality, incidence and prevalence, and cardiovascular disease treatment costs. Median antihypertensive costs from Shanghai and Yunnan province were entered into the model in order to estimate the effects of very low and high drug prices. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios less than the per capita gross domestic product of China (11,900 international dollars [Int$] in 2015) were considered cost-effective. Treating hypertensive adults with prior cardiovascular disease for secondary prevention was projected to be cost saving in the main simulation and 100% of probabilistic simulation results. Treating all hypertension for primary and secondary prevention would prevent about 800,000 cardiovascular disease events annually (95% uncertainty interval, 0.6 to 1.0 million) and was borderline cost-effective incremental to treating only cardiovascular disease and stage two patients (2015 Int$ 13,000 per QALY gained [95% uncertainty interval, Int$ 10,000 to Int$ 18,000]). Of all one-way sensitivity analyses, assuming adherence to taking medications as low as 25%, high Shanghai drug costs, or low medication efficacy led to the most unfavorable results (treating all hypertension, about Int$ 47,000, Int $ 37,000, and Int$ 27,000 per QALY were gained, respectively). The strengths of this study were the use of a recent Chinese national health survey, vital statistics, health care costs, and cohort study outcomes data as model inputs and reliance on clinical-trial-based estimates of coronary heart disease and stroke risk reduction due to antihypertensive medication treatment. The limitations of the study were the use of several sources of data, limited clinical trial evidence for medication effectiveness and harms in the youngest and oldest age groups, lack of information about geographic and ethnic subgroups, lack of specific information about indirect costs borne by patients, and uncertainty about the future epidemiology of cardiovascular diseases in China. Conclusions Expanded hypertension treatment has the potential to prevent about 800,000 cardiovascular disease events annually and be borderline cost-effective in China, provided low-cost essential antihypertensive medicines programs can be implemented.","[Gu, Dongfeng; Huang, Chen] Chinese Acad Med Sci, Fuwai Hosp, Dept Epidemiol, Beijing 100730, Peoples R China; [Gu, Dongfeng; Huang, Chen] Peking Union Med Coll, Beijing 100021, Peoples R China; [Gu, Dongfeng; Huang, Chen] Natl Ctr Cardiovasc Dis, Beijing, Peoples R China; [He, Jiang] Tulane Univ, Sch Publ Hlth & Trop Med, Dept Epidemiol, New Orleans, LA 70118 USA; [He, Jiang] Tulane Univ, Sch Med, Dept Med, New Orleans, LA 70118 USA; [Coxson, Pamela G.] Univ Calif San Francisco, Div Gen Med, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; [Rasmussen, Petra W.; Thanataveerat, Anusorn; Tzong, Keane Y.; Moran, Andrew E.] Columbia Univ, Med Ctr, Div Gen Med, New York, NY USA; [Xiong, Juyang] Huazhong Univ Sci & Technol, Tongji Med Coll, Sch Med & Hlth Management, Wuhan 430074, Peoples R China; [Wang, Miao; Zhao, Dong] Capital Med Univ, Beijing Anzhen Hosp, Dept Epidemiol, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Wang, Miao; Zhao, Dong] Beijing Inst Heart Lung & Blood Vessel Dis, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Goldman, Lee; Moran, Andrew E.] Columbia Univ Coll Phys & Surg, New York, NY 10032 USA","Gu, DF (reprint author), Chinese Acad Med Sci, Fuwai Hosp, Dept Epidemiol, Beijing 100730, Peoples R China.",gudongfeng@vip.sina.com; aem35@cumc.columbia.edu,,,"US National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute [K08 HL089675-01A1, R01 HL107475-01]; Ministry of Science and Technology of China [2011BAI09B03, 2011BAI11B03]","AEM was supported by a Career Development Award (K08 HL089675-01A1) and a research grant (R01 HL107475-01) from the US National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute.

Innovative strategies are needed to maximize the health impact and minimize the logistical barriers to using available vaccine. Here we ask under what conditions the use of one dose rather than the internationally licensed two-dose protocol may do both. Methods and Findings Using mathematical models we determined the minimum relative single-dose efficacy (MRSE) at which single-dose reactive campaigns are expected to be as or more effective than two-dose campaigns with the same amount of vaccine. Average one-and two-dose OCV effectiveness was estimated from published literature and compared to the MRSE. Results were applied to recent outbreaks in Haiti, Zimbabwe, and Guinea using stochastic simulations to illustrate the potential impact of one-and two-dose campaigns. At the start of an epidemic, a single dose must be 35%-56% as efficacious as two doses to avert the same number of cases with a fixed amount of vaccine (i.e., MRSE between 35% and 56%). This threshold decreases as vaccination is delayed. Short-term OCV effectiveness is estimated to be 77% (95% CI 57%-88%) for two doses and 44% (95% CI -27% to 76%) for one dose. This results in a one-dose relative efficacy estimate of 57% (interquartile range 13%-88%), which is above conservative MRSE estimates. Using our best estimates of one-and two-dose efficacy, we projected that a single-dose reactive campaign could have prevented 70,584 (95% prediction interval [PI] 55,943-86,205) cases in Zimbabwe, 78,317 (95% PI 57,435-100,150) in Port-au-Prince, Haiti, and 2,826 (95% PI 2,490-3,170) cases in Conakry, Guinea: 1.1 to 1.2 times as many as a two-dose campaign. While extensive sensitivity analyses were performed, our projections of cases averted in past epidemics are based on severely limited single-dose efficacy data and may not fully capture uncertainty due to imperfect surveillance data and uncertainty about the transmission dynamics of cholera in each setting. Conclusions Reactive vaccination campaigns using a single dose of OCV may avert more cases and deaths than a standard two-dose campaign when vaccine supplies are limited, while at the same time reducing logistical complexity. These findings should motivate consideration of the trade-offs between one-and two-dose campaigns in resource-constrained settings, though further field efficacy data are needed and should be a priority in any one-dose campaign.","[Azman, Andrew S.; Lessler, Justin] Johns Hopkins Bloomberg Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Epidemiol, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA; [Luquero, Francisco J.; Grais, Rebecca F.] Epictr, Paris, France; [Ciglenecki, Iza] Med Sans Frontieres, Geneva, Switzerland; [Sack, David A.] Johns Hopkins Bloomberg Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Int Hlth, Baltimore, MD USA","Azman, AS (reprint author), Johns Hopkins Bloomberg Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Epidemiol, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA.",justin@jhu.edu,,"Lessler, Justin/0000-0002-9741-8109; Azman, Andrew/0000-0001-8662-9077",Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation [OPP1089243]; Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation (DOVE project) [OPP153556]; K22 grant from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease [K22AI92150],"JL, ASA, FJL, and DAS's work were supported by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation (OPP1089243 and the DOVE project, OPP153556).

We undertook a Mendelian randomization (MR) study to evaluate whether genetically lowered vitamin D level influences the risk of MS. Methods and Findings We identified single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD) level from SUNLIGHT, the largest (n = 33,996) genome-wide association study to date for vitamin D. Four SNPs were genome-wide significant for 25OHD level (p-values ranging from 6 x 10(-10) to 2 x 10(-109)), and all four SNPs lay in, or near, genes strongly implicated in separate mechanisms influencing 25OHD. We then ascertained their effect on 25OHD level in 2,347 participants from a population-based cohort, the Canadian Multicentre Osteoporosis Study, and tested the extent to which the 25OHD-decreasing alleles explained variation in 25OHD level. We found that the count of 25OHD-decreasing alleles across these four SNPs was strongly associated with lower 25OHD level (n = 2,347, F-test statistic = 49.7, p = 2.4 x 10(-12)). Next, we conducted an MR study to describe the effect of genetically lowered 25OHD on the odds of MS in the International Multiple Sclerosis Genetics Consortium study, the largest genetic association study to date for MS (including up to 14,498 cases and 24,091 healthy controls). Alleles were weighted by their relative effect on 25OHD level, and sensitivity analyses were performed to test MR assumptions. MR analyses found that each genetically determined one-standard-deviation decrease in log-transformed 25OHD level conferred a 2.0-fold increase in the odds of MS (95% CI: 1.7-2.5; p = 7.7 x 10(-12); I-2 = 63%, 95% CI: 0%-88%). This result persisted in sensitivity analyses excluding SNPs possibly influenced by population stratification or pleiotropy (odds ratio [OR] = 1.7, 95% CI: 1.3-2.2; p = 2.3 x 10(-5); I-2 = 47%, 95% CI: 0%-85%) and including only SNPs involved in 25OHD synthesis or metabolism (ORsynthesis = 2.1, 95% CI: 1.6-2.6, p = 1 x 10(-9); ORmetabolism = 1.9, 95% CI: 1.3-2.7, p = 0.002). While these sensitivity analyses decreased the possibility that pleiotropy may have biased the results, residual pleiotropy is difficult to exclude entirely. Conclusions A genetically lowered 25OHD level is strongly associated with increased susceptibility to MS.

Different mechanisms have been postulated to explain these associations. This study aimed to investigate the casual relationships behind the strong association of maternal height with fetal growth measures (i.e., birth length and birth weight) and gestational age by a Mendelian randomization approach. Methods and Findings We conducted a Mendelian randomization analysis using phenotype and genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data of 3,485 mother/infant pairs from birth cohorts collected from three Nordic countries (Finland, Denmark, and Norway). We constructed a genetic score based on 697 SNPs known to be associated with adult height to index maternal height. To avoid confounding due to genetic sharing between mother and infant, we inferred parental transmission of the height-associated SNPs and utilized the haplotype genetic score derived from nontransmitted alleles as a valid genetic instrument for maternal height. In observational analysis, maternal height was significantly associated with birth length (p = 6.31 x 10(-9)), birth weight (p = 2.19 x 10(-15)), and gestational age (p = 1.51 x 10(-7)). Our parental-specific haplotype score association analysis revealed that birth length and birth weight were significantly associated with the maternal transmitted haplotype score as well as the paternal transmitted haplotype score. Their association with the maternal nontransmitted haplotype score was far less significant, indicating a major fetal genetic influence on these fetal growth measures. In contrast, gestational age was significantly associated with the nontransmitted haplotype score (p = 0.0424) and demonstrated a significant (p = 0.0234) causal effect of every 1 cm increase in maternal height resulting in similar to 0.4 more gestational d. Limitations of this study include potential influences in causal inference by biological pleiotropy, assortative mating, and the nonrandom sampling of study subjects. Conclusions Our results demonstrate that the observed association between maternal height and fetal growth measures (i.e., birth length and birth weight) is mainly defined by fetal genetics. In contrast, the association between maternal height and gestational age is more likely to be causal. In addition, our approach that utilizes the genetic score derived from the nontransmitted maternal haplotype as a genetic instrument is a novel extension to the Mendelian randomization methodology in casual inference between parental phenotype (or exposure) and outcomes in offspring.","[Zhang, Ge] Cincinnati Childrens Hosp Med Ctr, Div Human Genet, Cincinnati, OH 45229 USA; [Zhang, Ge; Lengyel, Candice; Muglia, Louis] Cincinnati Childrens Hosp Med Ctr, Perinatal Inst, Ctr Prevent Preterm Birth, Cincinnati, OH 45229 USA; [Zhang, Ge; Lengyel, Candice; Muglia, Louis] March Dimes Prematur Res Ctr Ohio Collaborat, Cincinnati, OH USA; [Bacelis, Jonas; Sengpiel, Verena] Sahlgrens Univ Hosp, Dept Obstet & Gynecol, Gothenburg, Sweden; [Teramo, Kari] Univ Helsinki, Obstet & Gynecol, Helsinki, Finland; [Teramo, Kari] Helsinki Univ Hosp, Helsinki, Finland; [Hallman, Mikko] Univ Oulu, PEDEGO Res Ctr, Oulu, Finland; [Hallman, Mikko] Oulu Univ Hosp, Dept Children & Adolescents, Oulu, Finland; [Helgeland, Oyvind; Johansson, Stefan; Njolstad, Pal Rasmus] Univ Bergen, Dept Clin Sci, KG Jebsen Ctr Diabet Res, Bergen, Norway; [Johansson, Stefan] Haukeland Hosp, Ctr Med Genet & Mol Med, N-5021 Bergen, Norway; [Myhre, Ronny; Jacobsson, Bo] Norwegian Inst Publ Hlth, Div Epidemiol, Dept Genes & Environm, Oslo, Norway; [Njolstad, Pal Rasmus] Haukeland Hosp, Dept Pediat, N-5021 Bergen, Norway; [Jacobsson, Bo] Gothenburg Univ, Inst Clin Sci, Dept Obstet & Gynecol, Sahlgrenska Acad, Gothenburg, Sweden","Zhang, G (reprint author), Cincinnati Childrens Hosp Med Ctr, Div Human Genet, Cincinnati, OH 45229 USA.",Ge.Zhang@cchmc.org; Louis.Muglia@cchmc.org,"Jacobsson, Bo/O-8007-2014; Johansson, Stefan/C-4394-2011","Jacobsson, Bo/0000-0001-5079-2374; Johansson, Stefan/0000-0002-2298-7008; Bacelis, Jonas/0000-0002-2450-732X; Hallman, Mikko/0000-0002-8172-729X","March of Dimes [22-FY14-470]; National Institutes of Health; Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center; Fifth Third Foundation; Norwegian Research Council; Swedish Medical Society; Jane Foundation; Dan Olsson Foundation; Swedish Government; European Community; ENGAGE Consortium; European Research Council; University of Bergen, Helse Vest; KG Jebsen Foundation","This work was supported by grants from the March of Dimes (22-FY14-470, National Institutes of Health, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Fifth Third Foundation, Norwegian Research Council, Swedish Medical Society, Jane and Dan Olsson Foundations, Swedish Government Grants to Researchers in the Public Health Service, European Community's Seventh Framework Programme, ENGAGE Consortium, the European Research Council, the University of Bergen, Helse Vest, and the KG Jebsen Foundation.

Poor sanitation practices can promote infection and induce stress during pregnancy and may contribute to adverse pregnancy outcomes (APOs). We aimed to assess whether poor sanitation practices were associated with increased risk of APOs such as preterm birth and low birth weight in a population-based study in rural India. Methods and Findings A prospective cohort of pregnant women (n = 670) in their first trimester of pregnancy was enrolled and followed until birth. Socio-demographic, clinical, and anthropometric factors, along with access to toilets and sanitation practices, were recorded at enrolment (12th week of gestation). A trained community health volunteer conducted home visits to ensure retention in the study and learn about study outcomes during the course of pregnancy. Unadjusted odds ratios (ORs) and adjusted odds ratios (AORs) and 95% confidence intervals for APOs were estimated by logistic regression models. Of the 667 women who were retained at the end of the study, 58.2% practiced open defecation and 25.7% experienced APOs, including 130 (19.4%) preterm births, 95 (14.2%) births with low birth weight, 11 (1.7%) spontaneous abortions, and six (0.9%) stillbirths. Unadjusted ORs for APOs (OR: 2.53; 95% CI: 1.72-3.71), preterm birth (OR: 2.36; 95% CI: 1.54-3.62), and low birth weight (OR: 2.00; 95% CI: 1.24-3.23) were found to be significantly associated with open defecation practices. After adjustment for potential confounders such as maternal socio-demographic and clinical factors, open defecation was still significantly associated with increased odds of APOs (AOR: 2.38; 95% CI: 1.49-3.80) and preterm birth (AOR: 2.22; 95% CI: 1.29-3.79) but not low birth weight (AOR: 1.61; 95% CI: 0.94-2.73). The association between APOs and open defecation was independent of poverty and caste. Even though we accounted for several key confounding factors in our estimates, the possibility of residual confounding should not be ruled out. We did not identify specific exposure pathways that led to the outcomes. Conclusions This study provides the first evidence, to our knowledge, that poor sanitation is associated with a higher risk of APOs. Additional studies are required to elucidate the socio-behavioural and/or biological basis of this association so that appropriate targeted interventions might be designed to support improved birth outcomes in vulnerable populations. While it is intuitive to expect that caste and poverty are associated with poor sanitation practice driving APOs, and we cannot rule out additional confounders, our results demonstrate that the association of poor sanitation practices (open defecation) with these outcomes is independent of poverty. Our results support the need to assess the mechanisms, both biological and behavioural, by which limited access to improved sanitation leads to APOs.","[Padhi, Bijaya K.; Dutta, Ambarish; Satpathy, Radhanatha; Das, Bhabani S.] Asian Inst Publ Hlth, Bhubaneswar, Orissa, India; [Baker, Kelly K.] Univ Iowa, Coll Publ Hlth, Iowa City, IA USA; [Cumming, Oliver] London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, Fac Infect & Trop Dis, London WC1, England; [Freeman, Matthew C.] Emory Univ, Rollins Sch Publ Hlth, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA; [Panigrahi, Pinaki] Univ Nebraska Med Ctr, Coll Publ Hlth, Omaha, NE 68198 USA","Panigrahi, P (reprint author), Univ Nebraska Med Ctr, Coll Publ Hlth, Omaha, NE 68198 USA.",ppanigrahi@unmc.edu,,"Baker, Kelly/0000-0002-3774-2628; Dutta, Ambarish/0000-0002-4019-7472",Water Supply and Sanitation Collaborative Council (WSSCC),"This work was made possible with UK aid from the Department for International Development (DfID), as part of the SHARE research programme, and support from the Water Supply and Sanitation Collaborative Council (WSSCC).

We sought to explore whether IDE genes play a role in the association of diabetes with dementia, AD, and structural brain changes using data from two community-based cohorts of older adults and a subsample with structural MRI. Methods and Findings The first cohort, which included dementia-free adults aged >= 75 y (n = 970) at baseline, was followed for 9 y to detect incident dementia (n = 358) and AD (n = 271) cases. The second cohort (for replication), which included 2,060 dementia-free participants aged >= 60 y at baseline, was followed for 6 y to identify incident dementia (n = 166) and AD (n = 121) cases. A subsample (n = 338) of dementia-free participants from the second cohort underwent MRI. HHEX_23 and IDE_9 were genotyped, and diabetes (here including type 2 diabetes and prediabetes) was assessed. In the first cohort, diabetes led to an adjusted hazard ratio (HR) of 1.73 (95% CI 1.19-2.32) and 1.66 (95% CI 1.06-2.40) for dementia and AD, respectively, among all participants. Compared to people carrying the GG genotype without diabetes, AA genotype carriers with diabetes had an adjusted HR of 5.54 (95% CI 2.407.18) and 4.81 (95% CI 1.88-8.50) for dementia and AD, respectively. There was a significant interaction between HHEX_23-AA and diabetes on dementia (HR 4.79, 95% CI 1.63-8.90, p = 0.013) and AD (HR 3.55, 95% CI 1.45-9.91, p = 0.025) compared to the GG genotype without diabetes. In the second cohort, the HRs were 1.68 (95% CI 1.04-2.99) and 1.64 (1.02-2.33) for the diabetes-AD and dementia-AD associations, respectively, and 4.06 (95% CI 1.06-7.58, p = 0.039) and 3.29 (95% CI 1.02-8.33, p = 0.044) for the interactions, respectively. MRI data showed that HHEX_23-AA carriers with diabetes had significant structural brain changes compared to HHEX_23-GG carriers without diabetes. No joint effects of IDE_9 and diabetes on dementia were shown. As a limitation, the sample sizes were small for certain subgroups. Conclusions A variant in the HHEX_23 gene interacts with diabetes to be associated with a substantially increased risk of dementia and AD, and with structural brain changes among dementia-free elderly people.","[Xu, Wei-Li; Keller, Lina; Kalpouzos, Gregoria; Wang, Hui-Xin; Winblad, Bengt; Backman, Lars; Fratiglioni, Laura] Karolinska Inst, Aging Res Ctr, Dept Neurobiol Care Sci & Soc, Stockholm, Sweden; [Xu, Wei-Li; Keller, Lina; Kalpouzos, Gregoria; Wang, Hui-Xin; Winblad, Bengt; Backman, Lars; Fratiglioni, Laura] Stockholm Univ, S-10691 Stockholm, Sweden; [Xu, Wei-Li] Tianjin Med Univ, Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Epidemiol & Biostat, Tianjin, Peoples R China; [Pedersen, Nancy L.] Karolinska Inst, Dept Med Epidemiol & Biostat, Stockholm, Sweden; [Keller, Lina; Graff, Caroline; Winblad, Bengt] Karolinska Inst, Dept Neurobiol Care Sci & Soc, Alzheimers Dis Res Ctr, Stockholm, Sweden; [Graff, Caroline] Karolinska Univ Hosp, Dept Geriatr Med, Stockholm, Sweden; [Fratiglioni, Laura] Stockholm Gerontol Res Ctr, Stockholm, Sweden","Xu, WL (reprint author), Karolinska Inst, Aging Res Ctr, Dept Neurobiol Care Sci & Soc, Stockholm, Sweden.",weili.xu@ki.se,"graff, caroline/A-2545-2009","Wang, Hui-Xin/0000-0002-5051-4929","Ministry of Health and Social Affairs, Sweden; Swedish Research Council; Swedish Council for Working Life and Social Research; Board of Research at Karolinska Institutet; Swedish Research Council in Medicine; Swedish Diabetes Association; Swedish Brain Power; Strokefonden; Gamla Tjanarinnor Foundation; Bertil Stohnes; Cornells Stiftelse; Sheikha Salama bint Hamdan Al Nahyan Foundation","The Swedish National Study on Aging and Care, SNAC, (www.snac.org) is financially supported by the Ministry of Health and Social Affairs, Sweden, the participating County Councils and Municipalities, and the Swedish Research Council.

We estimated the impacts on health, health inequalities, and health system costs of ongoing tobacco tax increases (10% annually from 2011 to 2031, compared to no tax increases from 2011 [""business as usual,"" BAU]), in a country (New Zealand) with large ethnic inequalities in smoking-related and noncommunicable disease (NCD) burden. Methods and Findings We modeled 16 tobacco-related diseases in parallel, using rich national data by sex, age, and ethnicity, to estimate undiscounted quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained and net health system costs over the remaining life of the 2011 population (n = 4.4 million). A total of 260,000 (95% uncertainty interval [UI]: 155,000-419,000) QALYs were gained among the 2011 cohort exposed to annual tobacco tax increases, compared to BAU, and cost savings were US$ 2,550 million (95% UI: US$ 1,480 to US$ 4,000). QALY gains and cost savings took 50 y to peak, owing to such factors as the price sensitivity of youth and young adult smokers. The QALY gains per capita were 3.7 times greater for Maori (indigenous population) compared to non-Maori because of higher background smoking prevalence and price sensitivity in Maori. Health inequalities measured by differences in 45+ y-old standardized mortality rates between Maori and non-Maori were projected to be 2.31%(95% UI: 1.49% to 3.41%) less in 2041 with ongoing tax rises, compared to BAU. Percentage reductions in inequalities in 2041 were maximal for 45-64-y-old women (3.01%). As with all such modeling, there were limitations pertaining to the model structure and input parameters. Conclusions Ongoing tobacco tax increases deliver sizeable health gains and health sector cost savings and are likely to reduce health inequalities. However, if policy makers are to achieve more rapid reductions in the NCD burden and health inequalities, they will also need to complement tobacco tax increases with additional tobacco control interventions focused on cessation.","[Blakely, Tony; Cobiac, Linda J.; Cleghorn, Christine L.; Pearson, Amber L.; van der Deen, Frederieke S.; Kvizhinadze, Giorgi; Nghiem, Nhung; McLeod, Melissa; Wilson, Nick] Univ Otago, Dept Publ Hlth, Burden Dis Epidemiol Equ & Cost Effectiveness, Wellington, New Zealand; [Cobiac, Linda J.] Univ Oxford, Nuffield Dept Populat Hlth, British Heart Fdn, Ctr Populat Approaches NCD Prevent, Oxford, England; [Pearson, Amber L.] Michigan State Univ, Dept Geog, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA","Blakely, T (reprint author), Univ Otago, Dept Publ Hlth, Burden Dis Epidemiol Equ & Cost Effectiveness, Wellington, New Zealand.",tony.blakely@otago.ac.nz,,"Blakely, Tony/0000-0002-6995-4369",BODE3 Programme; Health Research Council of New Zealand [10/248]; National Health and Medical Research Council Sidney Sax Public Health Fellowship [1036771],"The authors are supported by the BODE3 Programme, which is studying the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of various tobacco control strategies and receives funding support from the Health Research Council of New Zealand (Project number 10/248).

There are no published figures for high-resource settings, but media sources and individual case reports suggest it is much lower and approaches 0% for those who receive this level of care from the beginning of their illness. In their article ""Ebola Viral Disease: Experience and Decision Making for the First Cases outside of Africa,""David Stephens and colleagues give insight into the care that can be provided when available resources are not the limiting factor [2]. They describe the decision to open the Serious Communicable Diseases Unit (SCDU) of Emory University Hospital (EUH) when two United States patients contracted EVD while working in West Africa. Using a large specialist team, they provided high-quality care in a safe working environment and disseminated their knowledge and experience widely. In particular, they were able to respond to the huge increase in requests from health care facilities in the US for help in excluding the diagnosis of EVD. Caring for patients using an individualised approach under ideal circumstances contrasts with, but can also inform, the public health approach to care under resource-limited conditions in West Africa. The models of care employed in each environment show some similarities and also have a number of key differences.","[Boyles, Tom H.] Univ Cape Town, Dept Med, Div Infect Dis & HIV Med, ZA-7925 Cape Town, South Africa; [Boyles, Tom H.] Kings Coll London, Kings Ctr Global Hlth, Kings Sierra Leone Partnership, London WC2R 2LS, England; [Boyles, Tom H.] Kings Hlth Partners, London, England","Boyles, TH (reprint author), Univ Cape Town, Dept Med, Div Infect Dis & HIV Med, ZA-7925 Cape Town, South Africa.",tomboyles@yahoo.com,,"Boyles, Tom/0000-0002-5676-8081",,,,11,0,0,0,7,PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE,SAN FRANCISCO,"1160 BATTERY STREET, STE 100, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94111 USA",1549-1277,1549-1676,,PLOS MED,PLos Med.,JUL,2015,12,7,,,,,,,e1001858,10.1371/journal.pmed.1001858,,,,4,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,CO4SL,WOS:000359150800009,26218630,"DOAJ Gold, Green Published",,,8/3/2019,,35,45,35,0,45,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,25,3,6451,0,12,0,254,2,5934,330,0,12,0,254,2,187

These findings have not been tested in humans. We hypothesized that individuals prescribed GTZ drugs would have a lower incidence of PD compared to individuals prescribed other treatments for diabetes. Methods and Findings Using primary care data from the United Kingdom Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD), we conducted a retrospective cohort study in which individuals with diabetes who were newly prescribed GTZ (GTZ-exposed group) were matched by age, sex, practice, and diabetes treatment stage with up to five individuals prescribed other diabetes treatments (other antidiabetic drug-exposed group). Patients were followed up from 1999 until the first recording of a PD diagnosis, end of observation in the database, or end of the study (1 August 2013). An incidence rate ratio (IRR) was calculated using conditional Poisson regression, adjusted for possible confounders. 44,597 GTZ exposed individuals were matched to 120,373 other antidiabetic users. 175 GTZ-exposed individuals were diagnosed with PD compared to 517 individuals in the other antidiabetic drug-exposed group. The incidence rate (IR) of PD in the GTZ-exposed group was 6.4 per 10,000 patient years compared with 8.8 per 10,000 patient years in those prescribed other antidiabetic treatments (IRR 0.72, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.60-0.87). Adjustments for potential confounding variables, including smoking, other medications, head injury, and disease severity, had no material impact (fully adjusted IRR 0.75, 0.59-0.94). The risk was reduced in those with current GTZ prescriptions (current GTZ-exposed IRR 0.59, 0.46-0.77) but not reduced among those with past prescriptions (past GTZ-exposed IRR 0.85, 0.65-1.10). Our study only included patients with diabetes who did not have a PD diagnosis when they were first prescribed GTZ, and thus, it cannot establish whether GTZ use prevents or slows the progression of PD. Conclusions In patients with diabetes, a current prescription for GTZ is associated with a reduction in incidence of PD. This suggests PPAR gamma pathways may be a fruitful drug target in PD.","[Brauer, Ruth; Bhaskaran, Krishnan; Smeeth, Liam; Douglas, Ian] London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, Noncommunicable Dis Epidemiol, London WC1, England; [Chaturvedi, Nishi] UCL, Inst Cardiovasc Sci, London, England; [Dexter, David T.] Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Fac Med, Div Brain Sci, Ctr Neuroinflammat & Neurodegenerat, London, England","Brauer, R (reprint author), London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, Noncommunicable Dis Epidemiol, London WC1, England.",Ruth.brauer@lshtm.ac.uk,"CPRD, CPRD/B-9594-2017","Brauer, Ruth/0000-0001-8934-347X","Michael J.

The aim of this study was to determine whether and how N. meningitidis antimicrobial susceptibility, serogroup prevalence, and clonal complex (CC) prevalence shifted in association with the introduction and expanding use of quinolones in Shanghai, a region with a traditionally high incidence of invasive disease due to N. meningitidis. Methods and Findings A total of 374 N. meningitidis isolates collected by the Shanghai Municipal Center for Disease Control and Prevention between 1965 and 2013 were studied. Shifts in the serogroups and CCs were observed, from predominantly serogroup A CC5 (84%) in 1965-1973 to serogroup A CC1 (58%) in 1974-1985, then to serogroup C or B CC4821 (62%) in 2005-2013. The rates of ciprofloxacin nonsusceptibility in N. meningitidis disease isolates increased from 0% in 1965-1985 to 84% (31/37) in 2005-2013 (p < 0.001). Among the ciprofloxacin-nonsusceptible isolates, 87% (27/31) were assigned to either CC4821 (n = 20) or CC5 (n = 7). The two predominant ciprofloxacin-resistant clones were designated China(CC4821-R1-C/B) and China(CC5-R14-A). The China(CC4821-R1-C/B) clone acquired ciprofloxacin resistance by a point mutation, and was present in 52% (16/31) of the ciprofloxacin-nonsusceptible disease isolates. The China(CC5-R14-A) clone acquired ciprofloxacin resistance by horizontal gene transfer, and was found in 23% (7/31) of the ciprofloxacin-nonsusceptible disease isolates. The ciprofloxacin nonsusceptibility rate was 47% (7/15) among isolates from asymptomatic carriers, and nonsusceptibility was associated with diverse multi-locus sequence typing profiles and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis patterns. As detected after 2005, ciprofloxacin-nonsusceptible strains were shared between some of the patients and their close contacts. A limitation of this study is that isolates from 1986-2004 were not available and that only a small sample of convenience isolates from 1965-1985 were available. Conclusions The increasing prevalence of ciprofloxacin resistance since 2005 in Shanghai was associated with the spread of hypervirulent lineages CC4821 and CC5. Two resistant meningococcal clones China(CC4821-R1-C/B) and China(CC5-R14-A) have emerged in Shanghai during the quinolone era. Ciprofloxacin should be utilized with caution for the chemoprophylaxis of N. meningitidis in China.","[Chen, Mingliang; Qu, Di] Fudan Univ, Key Lab Med Mol Virol, Minist Educ, Inst Med Microbiol, Shanghai 200433, Peoples R China; [Chen, Mingliang; Qu, Di] Fudan Univ, Key Lab Med Mol Virol, Minist Hlth, Inst Med Microbiol, Shanghai 200433, Peoples R China; [Chen, Mingliang; Qu, Di] Fudan Univ, Inst Biomed Sci, Shanghai 200433, Peoples R China; [Chen, Mingliang; Guo, Qinglan; Zou, Ying; Xu, Xiaogang; Zhao, Miao; Hu, Fupin; Wang, Minggui] Fudan Univ, Huashan Hosp, Inst Antibiot, Shanghai 200433, Peoples R China; [Chen, Mingliang; Wang, Ye; Wang, Gangyi; Zhang, Xi; Chen, Min] Shanghai Municipal Ctr Dis Control & Prevent, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Zou, Ying] Fudan Univ, Intens Care Unit, Shanghai Publ Hlth Clin Ctr, Shanghai 200433, Peoples R China","Chen, ML (reprint author), Fudan Univ, Key Lab Med Mol Virol, Minist Educ, Inst Med Microbiol, Shanghai 200433, Peoples R China.",mgwang@fudan.edu.cn,"zhao, miao/O-9247-2019","Wang, Minggui/0000-0001-7682-5859","National Natural Science Foundation of China [81120108024, 81102509]; National Key Programs for Infectious Diseases of China [2013ZX10004216-001-004]; Shanghai Municipal Science and Technology Committee [12JC1401700]","This study was funded by grants (81120108024 to MW and 81102509 to QG) from the National Natural Science Foundation of China, a grant (2013ZX10004216-001-004 to MC) of the National Key Programs for Infectious Diseases of China, and a grant (12JC1401700 to MW) of Shanghai Municipal Science and Technology Committee.

In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we investigated the role of second-hand smoke (SHS) exposure as a risk factor for TB among children and adults. Methods and Findings We performed a systematic literature search of PubMed, Embase, Scopus, Web of Science, and Google Scholar up to August 31, 2014. Our a priori inclusion criteria encompassed only original studies where latent TB infection (LTBI) and active TB disease were diagnosed microbiologically, clinically, histologically, or radiologically. Effect estimates were pooled using fixed-and random-effects models. We identified 18 eligible studies, with 30,757 children and 44,432 adult non-smokers, containing SHS exposure and TB outcome data for inclusion in the meta-analysis. Twelve studies assessed children and eight studies assessed adult non-smokers; two studies assessed both populations. Summary relative risk (RR) of LTBI associated with SHS exposure in children was similar to the overall effect size, with high heterogeneity (pooled RR 1.64, 95% CI 1.00-2.83). Children showed a more than 3-fold increased risk of SHS-associated active TB (pooled RR 3.41, 95% CI 1.81-6.45), which was higher than the risk in adults exposed to SHS (summary RR 1.32, 95% CI 1.04-1.68). Positive and significant exposure-response relationships were observed among children under 5 y (RR 5.88, 95% CI 2.09-16.54), children exposed to SHS through any parent (RR 4.20, 95% CI 1.92-9.20), and children living under the most crowded household conditions (RR 5.53, 95% CI 2.36-12.98). Associations for LTBI and active TB disease remained significant after adjustment for age, biomass fuel (BMF) use, and presence of a TB patient in the household, although the meta-analysis was limited to a subset of studies that adjusted for these variables. There was a loss of association with increased risk of LTBI (but not active TB) after adjustment for socioeconomic status (SES) and study quality. The major limitation of this analysis is the high heterogeneity in outcomes among studies of pediatric cases of LTBI and TB disease. Conclusions We found that SHS exposure is associated with an increase in the relative risk of LTBI and active TB after controlling for age, BMF use, and contact with a TB patient, and there was no significant association of SHS exposure with LTBI after adjustment for SES and study quality. Given the high heterogeneity among the primary studies, our analysis may not show sufficient evidence to confirm an association. In addition, considering that the TB burden is highest in countries with increasing SHS exposure, it is important to confirm these results with higher quality studies. Research in this area may have important implications for TB and tobacco control programs, especially for children in settings with high SHS exposure and TB burden.","[Patra, Jayadeep; Bhatia, Mehak; Suraweera, Wilson; Jha, Prabhat] St Michaels Hosp, Ctr Global Hlth Res, Toronto, ON M5B 1W8, Canada; [Patra, Jayadeep; Bhatia, Mehak; Jha, Prabhat] Univ Toronto, Dalla Lana Sch Publ Hlth, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Morris, Shaun K.] Hosp Sick Children, Div Infect Dis, Toronto, ON M5G 1X8, Canada; [Morris, Shaun K.] Univ Toronto, Dept Pediat, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Patra, Cyril] Univ Memphis, Sch Publ Hlth, Memphis, TN 38152 USA; [Gupta, Prakash C.] Healis Sekhsaria Inst Publ Hlth, Mumbai, Maharashtra, India","Patra, J (reprint author), St Michaels Hosp, Ctr Global Hlth Res, 30 Bond St, Toronto, ON M5B 1W8, Canada.",patraj@smh.ca,"Suraweera, Wilson MG/O-8962-2014","Suraweera, Wilson/0000-0001-9673-5746",Centre for Global Health Research,"This study is financially supported by the Centre for Global Health Research for a post doctoral fellowship.

The evidence that sex worker HIV prevention programs work must not inspire complacency but rather a renewed effort to expand, intensify, and maximize their impact. The PLOS Collection ""Focus on Delivery and Scale: Achieving HIV Impact with Sex Workers"" highlights major challenges to scaling-up sex worker HIV prevention programs, noting the following: sex worker HIV prevention programs are insufficiently guided by understanding of epidemic transmission dynamics, situation analyses, and programmatic mapping; sex worker HIV and sexually transmitted infection services receive limited domestic financing in many countries; many sex worker HIV prevention programs are inadequately codified to ensure consistency and quality; and many sex worker HIV prevention programs have not evolved adequately to address informal sex workers, male and transgender sex workers, and mobile-and internet-based sex workers. Based on the wider collection of papers, this article presents three major clusters of recommendations: (i) HIV programs focused on sex workers should be prioritized, developed, and implemented based on robust evidence; (ii) national political will and increased funding are needed to increase coverage of effective sex worker HIV prevention programs in low and middle income countries; and (iii) comprehensive, integrated, and rapidly evolving HIV programs are needed to ensure equitable access to health services for individuals involved in all forms of sex work.","World Bank, Global HIV AIDS Program, Washington, DC 20004 USA","Wilson, D (reprint author), World Bank, Global HIV AIDS Program, Washington, DC 20004 USA.",dwilson@worldbank.org,,,,,,82,17,17,0,23,PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE,SAN FRANCISCO,"1160 BATTERY STREET, STE 100, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94111 USA",1549-1277,1549-1676,,PLOS MED,PLos Med.,JUN,2015,12,6,,,,,,,e1001808,10.1371/journal.pmed.1001808,,,,11,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,CM0UY,WOS:000357395500001,26079267,"DOAJ Gold, Green Published",,,8/3/2019,,122,111,122,0,111,22,18,22,13,0,0,0,0,0,0,15,14,15172,11,4,202,403,8,9386,5452,11,4,202,403,8,334

To lower their impact, preventive measures should be implemented that are sustainable with available resources. The aim of this study was to assess the impact of handwashing with soap and nail clipping on the prevention of intestinal parasite reinfections. Methods and Findings In this trial, 367 parasite-negative school-aged children (aged 6-15 y) were randomly assigned to receive both, one or the other, or neither of the interventions in a 2 x 2 factorial design. Assignment sequence was concealed. After 6 mo of follow-up, stool samples were examined using direct, concentration, and Kato-Katz methods. Hemoglobin levels were determined using a HemoCue spectrometer. The primary study outcomes were prevalence of intestinal parasite reinfection and infection intensity. The secondary outcome was anemia prevalence. Analysis was by intention to treat. Main effects were adjusted for sex, age, drinking water source, latrine use, pre-treatment parasites, handwashing with soap and nail clipping at baseline, and the other factor in the additive model. Fourteen percent (95% CI: 9% to 19%) of the children in the handwashing with soap intervention group were reinfected versus 29% (95% CI: 22% to 36%) in the groups with no handwashing with soap (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 0.32, 95% CI: 0.17 to 0.62). Similarly, 17% (95% CI: 12% to 22%) of the children in the nail clipping intervention group were reinfected versus 26% (95% CI: 20% to 32%) in the groups with no nail clipping (AOR 0.51, 95% CI: 0.27 to 0.95). Likewise, following the intervention, 13% (95% CI: 8% to 18%) of the children in the handwashing group were anemic versus 23% (95% CI: 17% to 29%) in the groups with no handwashing with soap (AOR 0.39, 95% CI: 0.20 to 0.78). The prevalence of anemia did not differ significantly between children in the nail clipping group and those in the groups with no nail clipping (AOR 0.53, 95% CI: 0.27 to 1.04). The intensive follow-up and monitoring during this study made it such that the assessment of the observed intervention benefits was under rather ideal circumstances, and hence the study could possibly overestimate the effects when compared to usual conditions. Conclusions Handwashing with soap at key times and weekly nail clipping significantly decreased intestinal parasite reinfection rates. Furthermore, the handwashing intervention significantly reduced anemia prevalence in children. The next essential step should be implementing pragmatic studies and developing more effective approaches to promote and implement handwashing with soap and nail clipping at larger scales.","[Abdulkader Mahmud, Mahmud] Mekelle Univ, Coll Hlth Sci, Dept Med Microbiol & Immunol, Mekelle, Ethiopia; [Spigt, Mark; Dinant, Geert-Jan] Maastricht Univ, CAPHRI Sch Publ Hlth & Primary Care, Dept Family Med, NL-6200 MD Maastricht, Netherlands; [Mulugeta Bezabih, Afework] Mekelle Univ, Coll Hlth Sci, Dept Publ Hlth, Mekelle, Ethiopia; [Lopez Pavon, Ignacio] Catalan Inst Hlth, Santa Coloma De Gramenet, Spain; [Blanco Velasco, Roman] Univ Alcala de Henares, Sch Med, Dept Surg, Madrid, Spain","Mahmud, MA (reprint author), Mekelle Univ, Coll Hlth Sci, Dept Med Microbiol & Immunol, Mekelle, Ethiopia.",muheab2008@yahoo.com,,,"Mekelle University, Ethiopia; Alcala University, Madrid, Spain","The study was funded by Mekelle University, Ethiopia (http://www.mu.edu.et) and Alcala University, Madrid, Spain (http://www.uah.es/).

This mixed-methods systematic review aims to synthesize qualitative and quantitative evidence on the mistreatment of women during childbirth in health facilities to inform the development of an evidence-based typology of the phenomenon. Methods and Findings We searched PubMed, CINAHL, and Embase databases and grey literature using a predetermined search strategy to identify qualitative, quantitative, and mixed-methods studies on the mistreatment of women during childbirth across all geographical and income-level settings. We used a thematic synthesis approach to synthesize the qualitative evidence and assessed the confidence in the qualitative review findings using the CERQual approach. In total, 65 studies were included from 34 countries. Qualitative findings were organized under seven domains: (1) physical abuse, (2) sexual abuse, (3) verbal abuse, (4) stigma and discrimination, (5) failure to meet professional standards of care, (6) poor rapport between women and providers, and (7) health system conditions and constraints. Due to high heterogeneity of the quantitative data, we were unable to conduct a meta-analysis; instead, we present descriptions of study characteristics, outcome measures, and results. Additional themes identified in the quantitative studies are integrated into the typology. Conclusions This systematic review presents a comprehensive, evidence-based typology of the mistreatment of women during childbirth in health facilities, and demonstrates that mistreatment can occur at the level of interaction between the woman and provider, as well as through systemic failures at the health facility and health system levels. We propose this typology be adopted to describe the phenomenon and be used to develop measurement tools and inform future research, programs, and interventions.","[Bohren, Meghan A.; Aguiar, Carolina; Hindin, Michelle J.] Johns Hopkins Bloomberg Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Populat Family & Reprod Hlth, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA; [Bohren, Meghan A.; Vogel, Joshua P.; Tuncalp, Oezge; Oladapo, Olufemi T.; Khosla, Rajat; Hindin, Michelle J.; Guelmezoglu, A.

It is unknown whether similar risks exist for recently postmenopausal women, and whether MHT affects mood in younger women. The ancillary Cognitive and Affective Study (KEEPS-Cog) of the Kronos Early Estrogen Prevention Study (KEEPS) examined the effects of up to 4 y of MHT on cognition and mood in recently postmenopausal women. Methods and Findings KEEPS, a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled clinical trial, was conducted at nine US academic centers. Of the 727 women enrolled in KEEPS, 693 (95.3%) participated in the ancillary KEEPS-Cog, with 220 women randomized to receive 4 y of 0.45 mg/d oral conjugated equine estrogens (o-CEE) plus 200 mg/d micronized progesterone (m-P) for the first 12 d of each month, 211 women randomized to receive 50 mu g/d transdermal estradiol (t-E2) plus 200 mg/d m-P for the first 12 d of each month, and 262 women randomized to receive placebo pills and patches. Primary outcomes included the Modified Mini-Mental State examination; four cognitive factors: verbal learning/memory, auditory attention/working memory, visual attention/executive function, and speeded language/mental flexibility; and a mood measure, the Profile of Mood States (POMS). MHT effects were analyzed using linear mixed-effects (LME) models, which make full use of all available data from each participant, including those with missing data. Data from those with and without full data were compared to assess for potential biases resulting from missing observations. For statistically significant results, we calculated effect sizes (ESs) to evaluate the magnitude of changes. On average, participants were 52.6 y old, and 1.4 y past their last menstrual period. By month 48, 169 (24.4%) and 158 (22.8%) of the 693 women who consented for ancillary KEEPS-Cog were lost to follow-up for cognitive assessment (3MS and cognitive factors) and mood evaluations (POMS), respectively. However, because LME models make full use all available data, including data from women with missing data, 95.5% of participants were included in the final analysis (n = 662 in cognitive analyses, and n = 661 in mood analyses). To be included in analyses, women must have provided baseline data, and data from at least one post-baseline visit. The mean length of follow-up was 2.85 y (standard deviation [SD] = 0.49) for cognitive outcomes and 2.76 (SD = 0.57) for mood outcomes. No treatment-related benefits were found on cognitive outcomes. For mood, model estimates indicated that women treated with o-CEE showed improvements in depression and anxiety symptoms over the 48 mo of treatment, compared to women on placebo. The model estimate for the depression subscale was -5.36 x 10(-2) (95% CI, -8.27 x 10(-2) to -2.44 x 10(-2); ES = 0.49, p < 0.001) and for the anxiety subscale was -3.01 x 10(-2) (95% CI, -5.09 x 10(-2) to -9.34 x 10(-3); ES = 0.26, p < 0.001). Mood outcomes for women randomized to t-E2 were similar to those for women on placebo. Importantly, the KEEPS-Cog results cannot be extrapolated to treatment longer than 4 y. Conclusions The KEEPS-Cog findings suggest that for recently postmenopausal women, MHT did not alter cognition as hypothesized. However, beneficial mood effects with small to medium ESs were noted with 4 y of o-CEE, but not with 4 y of t-E2. The generalizability of these findings is limited to recently postmenopausal women with low cardiovascular risk profiles.","[Gleason, Carey E.; Dowling, N.

The fitness of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDRTB) relative to drug-susceptible tuberculosis is cited as one of the most important determinants of MDRTB spread and epidemic size. To estimate the relative fitness of drug-resistant tuberculosis cases, we compared the incidence of tuberculosis disease among the household contacts of MDRTB index patients to that among the contacts of drug-susceptible index patients. Methods and Findings This 3-y (2010-2013) prospective cohort household follow-up study in South Lima and Callao, Peru, measured the incidence of tuberculosis disease among 1,055 household contacts of 213 MDRTB index cases and 2,362 household contacts of 487 drug-susceptible index cases. A total of 35/1,055 (3.3%) household contacts of 213 MDRTB index cases developed tuberculosis disease, while 114/2,362 (4.8%) household contacts of 487 drug-susceptible index patients developed tuberculosis disease. The total follow-up time for drug-susceptible tuberculosis contacts was 2,620 person-years, while the total follow-up time for MDRTB contacts was 1,425 person-years. Using multivariate Cox regression to adjust for confounding variables including contact HIV status, contact age, socio-economic status, and index case sputum smear grade, the hazard ratio for tuberculosis disease among MDRTB household contacts was found to be half that for drug-susceptible contacts (hazard ratio 0.56, 95% CI 0.34-0.90, p = 0.017). The inference of transmission in this study was limited by the lack of genotyping data for household contacts. Capturing incident disease only among household contacts may also limit the extrapolation of these findings to the community setting. Conclusions The low relative fitness of MDRTB estimated by this study improves the chances of controlling drug-resistant tuberculosis. However, fitter multidrug-resistant strains that emerge over time may make this increasingly difficult.","[Grandjean, Louis] Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Wellcome Ctr Clin Trop Med, London, England; [Grandjean, Louis; Gilman, Robert H.; Martin, Laura; Soto, Esther; Castro, Beatriz; Lopez, Sonia; Coronel, Jorge; Moore, David A.

However, the causality of these associations is unclear. We sought to assess the causal nature of these associations using Mendelian randomization (MR). Methods and Findings We used SNPs associated with each risk factor as instrumental variables in MR analyses. We considered type 2 diabetes (T2D, N-SNPs = 49), fasting glucose (N-SNPs = 36), insulin resistance (N-SNPs = 10), body mass index (BMI, N-SNPs = 32), total cholesterol (N-SNPs = 73), HDL-cholesterol (N-SNPs = 71), LDL-cholesterol (N-SNPs = 57), triglycerides (N-SNPs = 39), systolic blood pressure (SBP, N-SNPs = 24), smoking initiation (N-SNPs = 1), smoking quantity (N-SNPs = 3), university completion (N-SNPs = 2), and years of education (N-SNPs = 1). We calculated MR estimates of associations between each exposure and AD risk using an inverse-variance weighted approach, with summary statistics of SNP-AD associations from the International Genomics of Alzheimer's Project, comprising a total of 17,008 individuals with AD and 37,154 cognitively normal elderly controls. We found that genetically predicted higher SBP was associated with lower AD risk (odds ratio [OR] per standard deviation [15.4 mm Hg] of SBP [95% CI]: 0.75 [0.62-0.91]; p = 3.4 x 10(-3)). Genetically predicted higher SBP was also associated with a higher probability of taking antihypertensive medication (p = 6.7 x 10(-8)). Genetically predicted smoking quantity was associated with lower AD risk (OR per ten cigarettes per day [95% CI]: 0.67 [0.51-0.89]; p = 6.5 x 10(-3)), although we were unable to stratify by smoking history; genetically predicted smoking initiation was not associated with AD risk (OR = 0.70 [0.37, 1.33]; p = 0.28). We saw no evidence of causal associations between glycemic traits, T2D, BMI, or educational attainment and risk of AD (all p > 0.1). Potential limitations of this study include the small proportion of intermediate trait variance explained by genetic variants and other implicit limitations of MR analyses. Conclusions Inherited lifetime exposure to higher SBP is associated with lower AD risk. These findings suggest that higher blood pressure-or some environmental exposure associated with higher blood pressure, such as use of antihypertensive medications-may reduce AD risk.","[Ostergaard, Soren D.] Aarhus Univ Hosp, Res Dept P, Risskov, Denmark; [Ostergaard, Soren D.] Aarhus Univ, Dept Clin Med, Aarhus, Denmark; [Mukherjee, Shubhabrata; Gibbons, Laura E.; Larson, Eric B.; Crane, Paul K.] Univ Washington, Dept Med, Seattle, WA USA; [Sharp, Stephen J.; Lotta, Luca A.; Day, Felix; Perry, John R.

We sought to identify the implications of using alternative screening instruments to detect people with undiagnosed type 2 diabetes among diverse populations across India. Methods and Findings We developed and validated a microsimulation model that incorporated data from 58 studies from across the country into a nationally representative sample of Indians aged 25-65 y old. We estimated the diagnostic and health system implications of three major survey-based screening instruments and random glucometer-based screening. Of the 567 million Indians eligible for screening, depending on which of four screening approaches is utilized, between 158 and 306 million would be expected to screen as ""high risk"" for type 2 diabetes, and be referred for confirmatory testing. Between 26 million and 37 million of these people would be expected to meet international diagnostic criteria for diabetes, but between 126 million and 273 million would be ""false positives."" The ratio of false positives to true positives varied from 3.9 (when using random glucose screening) to 8.2 (when using a survey-based screening instrument) in our model. The cost per case found would be expected to be from US$5.28 (when using random glucose screening) to US$17.06 (when using a survey-based screening instrument), presenting a total cost of between US$169 and US$567 million. The major limitation of our analysis is its dependence on published cohort studies that are unlikely fully to capture the poorest and most rural areas of the country. Because these areas are thought to have the lowest diabetes prevalence, this may result in overestimation of the efficacy and health benefits of screening. Conclusions Large-scale community-based screening is anticipated to produce a large number of false-positive results, particularly if using currently available survey-based screening instruments. Resource allocators should consider the health system burden of screening and confirmatory testing when instituting large-scale community-based screening for diabetes.","[Basu, Sanjay; Ahuja, Rahoul] Stanford Univ, Prevent Res Ctr, Ctr Hlth Policy Primary Care & Outcomes Res, Ctr Poverty & Inequal, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Basu, Sanjay; Ahuja, Rahoul] Stanford Univ, Cardiovasc Inst, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Basu, Sanjay] London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, Dept Publ Hlth & Policy, London WC1, England; [Millett, Christopher] Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Sch Publ Hlth, London, England; [Millett, Christopher] Publ Hlth Fdn India, Delhi, India; [Vijan, Sandeep; Hayward, Rodney A.] Ann Arbor Vet Affairs Hosp, Ctr Clin Management Res, Ann Arbor, MI USA; [Vijan, Sandeep; Hayward, Rodney A.] Univ Michigan, Dept Internal Med, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Kinra, Sanjay] London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, Dept Epidemiol & Populat Hlth, London WC1, England; [Yudkin, John S.] UCL, Div Med, London, England","Basu, S (reprint author), Stanford Univ, Prevent Res Ctr, Ctr Hlth Policy Primary Care & Outcomes Res, Ctr Poverty & Inequal, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",basus@stanford.edu,"Yudkin, John S/C-1988-2008","Millett, Christopher/0000-0002-0793-9884",Rosenkranz Prize for Healthcare Research; International Development Research Center of Canada; NIHR Research Professorship award; National Institutes of Health [P60 DK-20572]; Wellcome Trust Capacity Strengthening Strategic Award,"Supported by the Rosenkranz Prize for Healthcare Research (SB), the International Development Research Center of Canada (SB), the NIHR Research Professorship award (CM), the National Institutes of Health (RH, SV, grant no.

To our knowledge, no systematic enquiry has been undertaken to determine if evidence existed to support these findings. We investigated CDSCO approvals for and availability of oral FDC drugs in four therapeutic areas: analgesia (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [NSAIDs]), diabetes (metformin), depression/anxiety (anti-depressants/benzodiazepines), and psychosis (anti-psychotics). Methods and Findings This was an ecologic study with a time-trend analysis of FDC sales volumes (2007-2012) and a cross-sectional examination of 2011-2012 data to establish the numbers of formulations on the market with and without a record of CDSCO approval (""approved"" and ""unapproved""), their branded products, and sales volumes. Data from the CDSCO on approved FDC formulations were compared with sales data from PharmaTrac, a database of national drug sales. We determined the proportions of FDC sales volumes (2011-2012) arising from centrally approved and unapproved formulations and from formulations including drugs banned/restricted internationally. We also determined the proportions of centrally approved and unapproved formulations marketed before and after 1 May 2002, when amendments were made to the drug rules. FDC approvals in India, the United Kingdom (UK), and United States of America (US) were compared. For NSAID FDCs, 124 formulations were marketed, of which 34 (27%) were centrally approved and 90 (73%) were unapproved; metformin: 25 formulations, 20 (80%) approved, five (20%) unapproved; anti-depressants/benzodiazepines: 16 formulations, three (19%) approved, 13 (81%) unapproved; anti-psychotics: ten formulations, three (30%) approved, seven (70%) unapproved. After 1 May 2002, the proportions of approved FDC formulations increased for NSAIDs (26%/28%) and anti-psychotics (0%/38%) and decreased for metformin (100%/75%) and anti-depressants/benzodiazepines (20%/18%), and the overall proportion approved remained similar before and after that date. FDC formulations gave rise to multiple branded products, ranging from 211 anti-psychotic FDC products from ten formulations to 2,739 NSAID FDC products from 124 formulations. The proportions of FDC sales volumes arising from unapproved formulations were as follows: anti-depressants/benzodiazepines, 69%; anti-psychotics, 43%; NSAIDs, 28%; and metformin, 0.4%. Formulations including drugs banned/restricted internationally comprised over 12% of NSAID FDC sales and 53% of anti-psychotic FDC sales. Across the four therapeutic areas, 14 FDC formulations were approved in the UK and 22 in the US. Conclusions There was evidence supporting concerns about FDCs. Metformin excepted, substantial numbers of centrally unapproved formulations for NSAID, anti-depressant/benzodiazepine, and anti-psychotic FDCs were marketed; sales volumes were high. The legal need for central approval of new drugs before manufacture has been in place continuously since 1961, including for FDCs meeting the applicable legal test.

Routine immunization of children has the potential to reduce this mortality through both direct and indirect protection, but has not been adopted by any low-or middle-income countries. We developed a framework to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of influenza vaccination policies in developing countries and used it to consider annual vaccination of school-and preschool-aged children with either trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (TIV) or trivalent live-attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) in Thailand. We also compared these approaches with a policy of expanding TIV coverage in the elderly. Methods and Findings We developed an age-structured model to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of eight vaccination policies parameterized using country-level data from Thailand. For policies using LAIV, we considered five different age groups of children to vaccinate. We adopted a Bayesian evidence-synthesis framework, expressing uncertainty in parameters through probability distributions derived by fitting the model to prospectively collected laboratory-confirmed influenza data from 2005-2009, by meta-analysis of clinical trial data, and by using prior probability distributions derived from literature review and elicitation of expert opinion. We performed sensitivity analyses using alternative assumptions about prior immunity, contact patterns between age groups, the proportion of infections that are symptomatic, cost per unit vaccine, and vaccine effectiveness. Vaccination of children with LAIV was found to be highly cost-effective, with incremental cost-effectiveness ratios between about 2,000 and 5,000 international dollars per disability-adjusted life year averted, and was consistently preferred to TIV-based policies. These findings were robust to extensive sensitivity analyses. The optimal age group to vaccinate with LAIV, however, was sensitive both to the willingness to pay for health benefits and to assumptions about contact patterns between age groups. Conclusions Vaccinating school-aged children with LAIV is likely to be cost-effective in Thailand in the short term, though the long-term consequences of such a policy cannot be reliably predicted given current knowledge of influenza epidemiology and immunology. Our work provides a coherent framework that can be used for similar analyses in other low-and middle-income countries.","[Meeyai, Aronrag; Praditsitthikorn, Naiyana; Kotirum, Surachai; Kulpeng, Wantanee; Teerawattananon, Yot] Hlth Intervent & Technol Assessment Program, Nonthaburi, Thailand; [Meeyai, Aronrag] Mahidol Univ, Dept Epidemiol, Fac Publ Hlth, Bangkok 10700, Thailand; [Praditsitthikorn, Naiyana] Minist Publ Hlth, Dept Dis Control, Bur AIDS TB & STI, Nonthaburi, Thailand; [Putthasri, Weerasak] Minist Publ Hlth, Int Hlth Policy Program, Nonthaburi, Thailand; [Cooper, Ben S.] Mahidol Oxford Trop Med Res Unit, Bangkok, Thailand; [Cooper, Ben S.] Univ Oxford, Nuffield Dept Clin Med, Ctr Trop Med & Global Hlth, Oxford, England","Meeyai, A (reprint author), Hlth Intervent & Technol Assessment Program, Nonthaburi, Thailand.",ben@tropmedres.ac,,"Cooper, Ben/0000-0002-9445-7217","World Health Organization headquarters in Geneva, Switzerland [2012/259630-0, V21-TSA-011]; Medical Research Council and Department for International Development [MR/K006924/1]; Wellcome Trust [089275/Z/09/Z]; Medical Research Council [MR/K006924/1]","This work was supported by the World Health Organization headquarters in Geneva, Switzerland (grant details: WHO Reference: 2012/259630-0, Reg.

It is unknown whether this association can be extrapolated to African-Americans and low-income populations. Methods and Findings We examined the associations of adherence to the DGA with total and cause-specific mortality in the Southern Community Cohort Study, a prospective study that recruited 84,735 American adults, aged 40-79 y, from 12 southeastern US states during 2002-2009, mostly through community health centers that serve low-income populations. The present analysis included 50,434 African-Americans, 24,054 white individuals, and 3,084 individuals of other racial/ethnic groups, among whom 42,759 participants had an annual household income less than US$15,000. Usual dietary intakes were assessed using a validated food frequency questionnaire at baseline. Adherence to the DGA was measured by the Healthy Eating Index (HEI), 2010 and 2005 editions (HEI-2010 and HEI-2005, respectively). During a mean follow-up of 6.2 y, 6,906 deaths were identified, including 2,244 from cardiovascular disease, 1,794 from cancer, and 2,550 from other diseases. A higher HEI-2010 score was associated with lower risks of disease death, with adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) of 0.80 (95% CI, 0.73-0.86) for all-disease mortality, 0.81 (95% CI, 0.70-0.94) for cardiovascular disease mortality, 0.81 (95% CI, 0.69-0.95) for cancer mortality, and 0.77 (95% CI, 0.67-0.88) for other disease mortality, when comparing the highest quintile with the lowest (all pvalues for trend < 0.05). Similar inverse associations between HEI-2010 score and mortality were observed regardless of sex, race, and income (all p-values for interaction > 0.50). Several component scores in the HEI-2010, including whole grains, dairy, seafood and plant proteins, and ratio of unsaturated to saturated fatty acids, showed significant inverse associations with total mortality. HEI-2005 score was also associated with lower disease mortality, with a HR of 0.86 (95% CI, 0.79-0.93) when comparing extreme quintiles. Given the observational study design, however, residual confounding cannot be completely ruled out. In addition, future studies are needed to evaluate the generalizability of these findings to African-Americans of other socioeconomic status. Conclusions Our results showed, to our knowledge for the first time, that adherence to the DGA was associated with lower total and cause-specific mortality in a low-income population, including a large proportion of African-Americans, living in the southeastern US.","[Yu, Danxia; Shu, Xiao-Ou; Zhang, Xianglan; Zheng, Wei] Vanderbilt Univ, Sch Med, Div Epidemiol, Nashville, TN 37212 USA; [Sonderman, Jennifer; McLaughlin, Joseph K.; Steinwandel, Mark; Blot, William J.] Int Epidemiol Inst, Rockville, MD USA; [Buchowski, Maciej S.; Blot, William J.] Vanderbilt Univ, Sch Med, Dept Med, Nashville, TN 37212 USA; [Buchowski, Maciej S.; McLaughlin, Joseph K.; Shu, Xiao-Ou; Zheng, Wei] Vanderbilt Univ, Vanderbilt Ingram Canc Ctr, Nashville, TN 37235 USA; [Signorello, Lisa B.] Harvard Univ, Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Epidemiol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Hargreaves, Margaret K.] Meharry Med Coll, Dept Internal Med, Nashville, TN 37208 USA","Yu, DX (reprint author), Vanderbilt Univ, Sch Med, Div Epidemiol, Nashville, TN 37212 USA.",wei.zheng@vanderbilt.edu,,,National Cancer Institute [R01 CA092447],"This work was supported by grant R01 CA092447 from the National Cancer Institute (www.cancer.gov).

Utilizing longitudinal data in the United Kingdom birth cohort studies, we investigated shifts over the past nearly 70 years in the distribution of body mass index (BMI) and development of overweight or obesity across childhood and adulthood. Methods and Findings The sample comprised 56,632 participants with 273,843 BMI observations in the 1946 Medical Research Council National Survey of Health and Development (NSHD; ages 2-64 years), 1958 National Child Development Study (NCDS; 7-50), 1970 British Cohort Study (BCS; 10-42), 1991 Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC; 7-18), or 2001 Millennium Cohort Study (MCS; 3-11). Growth references showed a secular trend toward positive skewing of the BMI distribution at younger ages. During childhood, the 50th centiles for all studies lay in the middle of the International Obesity Task Force normal weight range, but during adulthood, the age when a 50th centile first entered the overweight range (i.e., 25-29.9 kg/m(2)) decreased across NSHD, NCDS, and BCS from 41 to 33 to 30 years in males and 48 to 44 to 41 years in females. Trajectories of overweight or obesity showed that more recently born cohorts developed greater probabilities of overweight or obesity at younger ages. Overweight or obesity became more probable in NCDS than NSHD in early adulthood, but more probable in BCS than NCDS and NSHD in adolescence, for example. By age 10 years, the estimated probabilities of overweight or obesity in cohorts born after the 1980s were 2-3 times greater than those born before the 1980s (e.g., 0.229 [95% CI 0.219-0.240] in MCS males; 0.071 [0.065-0.078] in NSHD males). It was not possible to (1) model separate trajectories for overweight and obesity, because there were few obesity cases at young ages in the earliest-born cohorts, or (2) consider ethnic minority groups. The end date for analyses was August 2014. Conclusions Our results demonstrate how younger generations are likely to accumulate greater exposure to overweight or obesity throughout their lives and, thus, increased risk for chronic health conditions such as coronary heart disease and type 2 diabetes mellitus. In the absence of effective intervention, overweight and obesity will have severe public health consequences in decades to come.","[Johnson, William; Kuh, Diana; Hardy, Rebecca] UCL, MRC, Unit Lifelong Hlth & Ageing, London, England; [Li, Leah] UCL, Inst Child Hlth, London, England","Johnson, W (reprint author), UCL, MRC, Unit Lifelong Hlth & Ageing, London, England.",William.Johnson@mrc-hnr.cam.ac.uk,", ALSPAC/R-2016-2018","Johnson, Will/0000-0002-0347-4354","Economic and Social Research Council [ES/K000357/1]; UK Medical Research Council; Wellcome Trust [102215/2/13/2]; University of Bristol; UK Medical Research Council [MC_UU_12019/1]; Economic and Social Research Council; Medical Research Council [MC_UP_1005/1, MC_UU_12019/1, MC_PC_15018, MC_UU_12019/2]","This project is part of a collaborative research programme entitled ""Cohorts and Longitudinal Studies Enhancement Resources"" (CLOSER).

There is uncertainty about the ability of different clinical trial designs to identify effective treatments, and about the feasibility of implementing individually randomised controlled trials during an Ebola epidemic. Methods and Findings A treatment evaluation programme for use in EVD was devised using a multi-stage approach (MSA) with two or three stages, including both non-randomised and randomised elements. The probabilities of rightly or wrongly recommending the experimental treatment, the required sample size, and the consequences for epidemic outcomes over 100 d under two epidemic scenarios were compared for the MSA, a sequential randomised controlled trial (SRCT) with up to 20 interim analyses, and, as a reference case, a conventional randomised controlled trial (RCT) without interim analyses. Assuming 50% 14-d survival in the population treated with the current standard of supportive care, all designs had similar probabilities of identifying effective treatments correctly, while the MSA was less likely to recommend treatments that were ineffective. The MSA led to a smaller number of cases receiving ineffective treatments and faster roll-out of highly effective treatments. For less effective treatments, the MSA had a high probability of including an RCT component, leading to a somewhat longer time to roll-out or rejection. Assuming 100 new EVD cases per day, the MSA led to between 6% and 15% greater reductions in epidemic mortality over the first 100 d for highly effective treatments compared to the SRCT. Both the MSA and SRCT led to substantially fewer deaths than a conventional RCT if the tested interventions were either highly effective or harmful. In the proposed MSA, the major threat to the validity of the results of the non-randomised components is that referral patterns, standard of care, or the virus itself may change during the study period in ways that affect mortality. Adverse events are also harder to quantify without a concurrent control group. Conclusions The MSA discards ineffective treatments quickly, while reliably providing evidence concerning effective treatments.

We conducted a prospective observational study to assess penile HIV shedding after MC. Methods and Findings HIV shedding was evaluated among 223 HIV-infected men (183 self-reported not receiving antiretroviral therapy [ART], 11 self-reported receiving ART and had a detectable plasma viral load [VL], and 29 self-reported receiving ART and had an undetectable plasma VL [< 400 copies/ml]) in Rakai, Uganda, between June 2009 and April 2012. Preoperative and weekly penile lavages collected for 6 wk and then at 12 wk were tested for HIV shedding and VL using a real-time quantitative PCR assay. Unadjusted prevalence risk ratios (PRRs) and adjusted PRRs (adjPRRs) of HIV shedding were estimated using modified Poisson regression with robust variance. HIV shedding was detected in 9.3% (17/183) of men not on ART prior to surgery and 39.3% (72/183) of these men during the entire study. Relative to baseline, the proportion shedding was significantly increased after MC at 1 wk (PRR = 1.87, 95% CI = 1.12-3.14, p = 0.012), 2 wk (PRR = 3.16, 95% CI = 1.94-5.13, p < 0.001), and 3 wk (PRR = 1.98, 95% CI = 1.19-3.28, p = 0.008) after MC. However, compared to baseline, HIV shedding was decreased by 6 wk after MC (PRR = 0.27, 95% CI = 0.09-0.83, p = 0.023) and remained suppressed at 12 wk after MC (PRR = 0.19, 95% CI = 0.06-0.64, p = 0.008). Detectable HIV shedding from MC wounds occurred in more study visits among men with an HIV plasma VL > 50,000 copies/ml than among those with an HIV plasma VL < 400 copies/ml (adjPRR = 10.3, 95% CI = 4.25-24.90, p < 0.001). Detectable HIV shedding was less common in visits from men with healed MC wounds compared to visits from men without healed wounds (adjPRR = 0.12, 95% CI = 0.07-0.23, p < 0.001) and in visits from men on ART with undetectable plasma VL compared to men not on ART (PRR = 0.15, 95% CI = 0.05-0.43, p = 0.001). Among men with detectable penile HIV shedding, the median log(10) HIV copies/milliliter of lavage fluid was significantly lower in men with ART-induced undetectable plasma VL (1.93, interquartile range [IQR] = 1.83-2.14) than in men not on ART (2.63, IQR = 2.28-3.22, p < 0.001). Limitations of this observational study include significant differences in baseline covariates, lack of confirmed receipt of ART for individuals who reported ART use, and lack of information on potential ART initiation during follow-up for those who were not on ART at enrollment. Conclusion Penile HIV shedding is significantly reduced after healing of MC wounds. Lower plasma VL is associated with decreased frequency and quantity of HIV shedding from MC wounds. Starting ART prior to MC should be considered to reduce male-to-female HIV transmission risk. Research is needed to assess the time on ART required to decrease shedding, and the acceptability and feasibility of initiating ART at the time of MC.","[Tobian, Aaron A.

Methods and Findings We reviewed all GenBank submissions of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase sequences with or without protease and identified 287 studies published between March 1, 2000, and December 31, 2013, with more than 25 recently or chronically infected ARV-naive individuals. These studies comprised 50,870 individuals from 111 countries. Each set of study sequences was analyzed for phylogenetic clustering and the presence of 93 surveillance drug-resistance mutations (SDRMs). The median overall TDR prevalence in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), south/southeast Asia (SSEA), upper-income Asian countries, Latin America/Caribbean, Europe, and North America was 2.8%, 2.9%, 5.6%, 7.6%, 9.4%, and 11.5%, respectively. In SSA, there was a yearly 1.09-fold (95% CI: 1.05-1.14) increase in odds of TDR since national ARV scale-up attributable to an increase in non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) resistance. The odds of NNRTI-associated TDR also increased in Latin America/Caribbean (odds ratio [OR] = 1.16; 95% CI: 1.06-1.25), North America (OR = 1.19; 95% CI: 1.12-1.26), Europe (OR = 1.07; 95% CI: 1.01-1.13), and upper-income Asian countries (OR = 1.33; 95% CI: 1.12-1.55). In SSEA, there was no significant change in the odds of TDR since national ARV scale-up (OR = 0.97; 95% CI: 0.92-1.02). An analysis limited to sequences with mixtures at less than 0.5% of their nucleotide positions-a proxy for recent infection-yielded trends comparable to those obtained using the complete dataset. Four NNRTI SDRMs-K101E, K103N, Y181C, and G190A-accounted for > 80% of NNRTI-associated TDR in all regions and subtypes. Sixteen nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) SDRMs accounted for > 69% of NRTI-associated TDR in all regions and subtypes. In SSA and SSEA, 89% of NNRTI SDRMs were associated with high-level resistance to nevirapine or efavirenz, whereas only 27% of NRTI SDRMs were associated with high-level resistance to zidovudine, lamivudine, tenofovir, or abacavir. Of 763 viruses with TDR in SSA and SSEA, 725 (95%) were genetically dissimilar; 38 (5%) formed 19 sequence pairs. Inherent limitations of this study are that some cohorts may not represent the broader regional population and that studies were heterogeneous with respect to duration of infection prior to sampling. Conclusions Most TDR strains in SSA and SSEA arose independently, suggesting that ARV regimens with a high genetic barrier to resistance combined with improved patient adherence may mitigate TDR increases by reducing the generation of new ARV-resistant strains. A small number of NNRTI-resistance mutations were responsible for most cases of high-level resistance, suggesting that inexpensive point-mutation assays to detect these mutations may be useful for pre-therapy screening in regions with high levels of TDR. In the context of a public health approach to ARV therapy, a reliable point-of-care genotypic resistance test could identify which patients should receive standard first-line therapy and which should receive a protease-inhibitor-containing regimen.","[Rhee, Soo-Yon; Varghese, Vici; Katzenstein, David; Shafer, Robert W.] Stanford Univ, Dept Med, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Blanco, Jose Luis] Univ Barcelona, Hosp Clin Univ, Inst Invest Biomed August Pi & Sunyer, Barcelona, Spain; [Jordan, Michael R.] Tufts Univ, Sch Med, Boston, MA 02111 USA; [Taylor, Jonathan] Stanford Univ, Dept Stat, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Lemey, Philippe; Vandamme, Anne-Mieke] Univ Leuven, KU Leuven, Dept Microbiol & Immunol, Rega Inst Med Res Clin & Epidemiol Virol, Leuven, Belgium; [Hamers, Raph L.; de Wit, TobiasF.

It is characterised by delayed asexual-stage parasite clearance, which is the reference comparator for the molecular marker 'Kelch 13' and in vitro sensitivity tests. However, current cut-off values denoting slow clearance based on the proportion of individuals remaining parasitaemic on the third day of treatment ('day-3'), or on peripheral blood parasite half-life, are not well supported. We here explore the parasite clearance distributions in an area of artemisinin resistance with the aim refining the in vivo phenotypic definitions. Methods and Findings Data from 1,518 patients on the Thai-Myanmar and Thai-Cambodian borders with parasite half-life assessments after artesunate treatment were analysed. Half-lives followed a bimodal distribution. A statistical approach was developed to infer the characteristics of the component distributions and their relative contribution to the composite mixture. A model representing two parasite subpopulations with geometric mean (IQR) parasite half-lives of 3.0 (2.4-3.9) hours and 6.50 (5.7-7.4) hours was consistent with the data. For individual patients, the parasite half-life provided a predicted likelihood of an artemisinin-resistant infection which depends on the population prevalence of resistance in that area. Consequently, a half-life where the probability is 0.5 varied between 3.5 and 5.5 hours. Using this model, the current 'day-3' cut-off value of 10% predicts the potential presence of artemisinin-resistant infections in most but not all scenarios. These findings are relevant to the low-transmission setting of Southeast Asia. Generalisation to a high transmission setting as in regions of Sub-Saharan Africa will need additional evaluation. Conclusions Characterisation of overlapping distributions of parasite half-lives provides quantitative insight into the relationship between parasite clearance and artemisinin resistance, as well as the predictive value of the 10% cut-off in 'day-3' parasitaemia. The findings are important for the interpretation of in vitro sensitivity tests and molecular markers for artemisinin resistance and for contextualising the 'day 3' threshold to account for initial parasitaemia and sample size.","[White, Lisa J.; Phyo, Aung Pyae; Cooper, Ben S.; Lubell, Yoel; Ashley, Elizabeth A.; Nosten, Francois; White, Nicholas J.; Dondorp, Arjen M.] Univ Oxford, Nuffield Dept Med, Ctr Trop Med, Oxford, England; [White, Lisa J.; Tripura, Rupam; Pan-Ngum, Wirichada; Silamut, Kamolrat; Cooper, Ben S.; Lubell, Yoel; Ashley, Elizabeth A.; White, Nicholas J.; Dondorp, Arjen M.] Mahidol Univ, Fac Trop Med, Mahidol Oxford Trop Med Res Unit, Bangkok, Thailand; [Flegg, Jennifer A.; Stepniewska, Kasia] Univ Oxford, Worldwide Antimalarial Resistance Network, Oxford, England; [Phyo, Aung Pyae; Wiladpai-ngern, Ja Hser; Nosten, Francois] Mahidol Univ, Fac Trop Med, Mahidol Oxford Trop Med Res Unit, Shoklo Malaria Res Unit,Thailand Armed Forces Res, Bangkok, Thailand; [Bethell, Delia] Univ Maryland, Sch Med, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Ctr Vaccine Dev, Baltimore, MD 21201 USA; [Plowe, Christopher] Texas Biomed Res Inst, Dept Genet, San Antonio, TX USA; [Anderson, Tim; Nkhoma, Standwell; Nair, Shalini; Nguon, Chea] Minist Hlth, Natl Malaria Ctr, Phnom Penh, Cambodia","White, LJ (reprint author), Univ Oxford, Nuffield Dept Med, Ctr Trop Med, Oxford, England.",lisa@tropmedres.ac,"Phyo, Aung Pyae/K-2413-2019","Phyo, Aung Pyae/0000-0002-0383-9624; Flegg, Jennifer/0000-0002-8809-726X; Lubell, Yoel/0000-0002-0237-1070; White, Lisa/0000-0002-6523-185X; Nosten, Francois/0000-0002-7951-0745; Cooper, Ben/0000-0002-9445-7217",Wellcome-Trust Major Overseas Programme in SE Asia [077166/Z/05/Z],"The study was part of the Wellcome-Trust Major Overseas Programme in SE Asia (grant number 077166/Z/05/Z).

Analyses of this cohort underlie the widespread view that the acute phase is highly infectious, even more so than would be predicted from its elevated viral load, and that transmission occurring shortly after infection may therefore compromise interventions that rely on diagnosis and treatment, such as antiretroviral treatment as prevention (TasP). Here, we re-estimate the duration and relative infectivity of the acute phase, while accounting for several possible sources of bias in published estimates, including the retrospective cohort exclusion criteria and unmeasured heterogeneity in risk. Methods and Findings We estimated acute phase infectivity using two approaches. First, we combined viral load trajectories and viral load-infectivity relationships to estimate infectivity trajectories over the course of infection, under the assumption that elevated acute phase infectivity is caused by elevated viral load alone. Second, we estimated the relative hazard of transmission during the acute phase versus the chronic phase (RHacute) and the acute phase duration (dacute) by fitting a couples transmission model to the Rakai retrospective cohort using approximate Bayesian computation. Our model fit the data well and accounted for characteristics overlooked by previous analyses, including individual heterogeneity in infectiousness and susceptibility and the retrospective cohort's exclusion of couples that were recorded as serodiscordant only once before being censored by loss to follow-up, couple dissolution, or study termination. Finally, we replicated two highly cited analyses of the Rakai data on simulated data to identify biases underlying the discrepancies between previous estimates and our own. From the Rakai data, we estimated RHacute = 5.3 (95% credibility interval [ 95% CrI]: 0.79-57) and d(acute) = 1.7 mo (95% CrI: 0.55-6.8). The wide credibility intervals reflect an inability to distinguish a long, mildly infectious acute phase from a short, highly infectious acute phase, given the 10-mo Rakai observation intervals. The total additional risk, measured as excess hazard-months attributable to the acute phase (EHMacute) can be estimated more precisely: EHMacute = (RHacute-1) x d(acute), and should be interpreted with respect to the 120 hazard-months generated by a constant untreated chronic phase infectivity over 10 y of infection. From the Rakai data, we estimated that EHMacute = 8.4 (95% CrI: -0.27 to 64). This estimate is considerably lower than previously published estimates, and consistent with our independent estimate from viral load trajectories, 5.6 (95% confidence interval: 3.3-9.1). We found that previous overestimates likely stemmed from failure to account for risk heterogeneity and bias resulting from the retrospective cohort study design. Our results reflect the interaction between the retrospective cohort exclusion criteria and high (47%) rates of censorship amongst incident serodiscordant couples in the Rakai study due to loss to follow-up, couple dissolution, or study termination. We estimated excess physiological infectivity during the acute phase from couples data, but not the proportion of transmission attributable to the acute phase, which would require data on the broader population's sexual network structure. Conclusions Previous EHMacute estimates relying on the Rakai retrospective cohort data range from 31 to 141. Our results indicate that these are substantial overestimates of HIV-1 acute phase infectivity, biased by unmodeled heterogeneity in transmission rates between couples and by inconsistent censoring. Elevated acute phase infectivity is therefore less likely to undermine TasP interventions than previously thought. Heterogeneity in infectiousness and susceptibility may still play an important role in intervention success and deserves attention in future analyses","[Bellan, Steve E.] Univ Texas Austin, Ctr Computat Biol & Bioinformat, Austin, TX 78712 USA; [Dushoff, Jonathan] McMaster Univ, Dept Biol, Hamilton, ON, Canada; [Galvani, Alison P.] Yale Univ, Sch Publ Hlth, New Haven, CT USA; [Galvani, Alison P.] Yale Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolut, New Haven, CT USA; [Meyers, Lauren Ancel] Univ Texas Austin, Dept Integrat Biol, Austin, TX 78712 USA; [Meyers, Lauren Ancel] Santa Fe Inst, Santa Fe, NM 87501 USA","Bellan, SE (reprint author), Univ Texas Austin, Ctr Computat Biol & Bioinformat, Austin, TX 78712 USA.",steve.bellan@gmail.com,"; Bellan, Steven/D-6368-2013","Meyers, Lauren/0000-0002-5828-8874; Bellan, Steven/0000-0002-4110-272X",National Institute of Health [R25GM102149]; African Institute for Mathematical Sciences; South African Centre for Excellence in Epidemiological Modelling and Analysis; J.S.

A large proportion of asymptomatic parasite infections can only be identified by surveillance with molecular methods, yet these infections also contribute to onward transmission to mosquitoes. The sensitivity of molecular detection by PCR is limited by the abundance of the target sequence in a DNA sample; thus, detection becomes imperfect at low densities. We aimed to increase PCR diagnostic sensitivity by targeting multi-copy genomic sequences for reliable detection of low-density infections, and investigated the impact of these PCR assays on community prevalence data. Methods and Findings Two quantitative PCR (qPCR) assays were developed for ultra-sensitive detection of Plasmodium falciparum, targeting the high-copy telomere-associated repetitive element 2 (TARE-2, similar to 250 copies/genome) and the var gene acidic terminal sequence (varATS, 59 copies/genome). Our assays reached a limit of detection of 0.03 to 0.15 parasites/mu l blood and were 10x more sensitive than standard 18S rRNA qPCR. In a population cross-sectional study in Tanzania, 295/498 samples tested positive using ultra-sensitive assays. Light microscopy missed 169 infections (57%). 18S rRNA qPCR failed to identify 48 infections (16%), of which 40% carried gametocytes detected by pfs25 quantitative reverse-transcription PCR. To judge the suitability of the TARE-2 and varATS assays for high-throughput screens, their performance was tested on sample pools. Both ultra-sensitive assays correctly detected all pools containing one low-density P. falciparum-positive sample, which went undetected by 18S rRNA qPCR, among nine negatives. TARE-2 and varATS qPCRs improve estimates of prevalence rates, yet other infections might still remain undetected when absent in the limited blood volume sampled. Conclusions Measured malaria prevalence in communities is largely determined by the sensitivity of the diagnostic tool used. Even when applying standard molecular diagnostics, prevalence in our study population was underestimated by 8% compared to the new assays. Our findings highlight the need for highly sensitive tools such as TARE-2 and varATS qPCR in community surveillance and for monitoring interventions to better describe malaria epidemiology and inform malaria elimination efforts.","[Hofmann, Natalie; Mwingira, Felista; Felger, Ingrid] Swiss Trop & Publ Hlth Inst, Basel, Switzerland; [Hofmann, Natalie; Mwingira, Felista; Felger, Ingrid] Univ Basel, Basel, Switzerland; [Mwingira, Felista] Univ Dar Es Salaam, Coll Educ, Dept Biol Sci, Dar Es Salaam, Tanzania; [Shekalaghe, Seif] Ifakara Hlth Inst, Bagamoyo, Tanzania; [Robinson, Leanne J.] Papua New Guinea Inst Med Res, Madang, Papua N Guinea; [Robinson, Leanne J.] Papua New Guinea Inst Med Res, Maprik, Papua N Guinea; [Robinson, Leanne J.; Mueller, Ivo] Walter & Eliza Hall Inst Med Res, Parkville, Vic, Australia; [Robinson, Leanne J.; Mueller, Ivo] Univ Melbourne, Dept Med Biol, Parkville, Vic 3052, Australia; [Mueller, Ivo] Ctr Recerca Salut Int Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain","Hofmann, N (reprint author), Swiss Trop & Publ Hlth Inst, Basel, Switzerland.",ingrid.felger@unibas.ch,,"Felger, Ingrid/0000-0003-1255-2606",Swiss National Science Foundation [310030_134889]; International Centers of Excellence in Malaria Research [U19 AI089686]; Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation [OPP1034577]; Science and Technology Higher Education Project (STHEP) through the Dar-Es-Salaam University College of Education (DULE); Stipendienkommission Basel Stadt; NHMRC [GNT1043345],"This work was supported by Swiss National Science Foundation [grant number 310030_134889], International Centers of Excellence in Malaria Research [grant number U19 AI089686) and Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation [grant number OPP1034577].

In the context of this diversity, an effective NoV vaccine must elicit broadly protective immunity. We used an antibody (Ab) binding blockade assay to measure the potential cross-strain protection provided by a multivalent NoV virus-like particle (VLP) candidate vaccine in human volunteers. Methods and Findings Sera from ten human volunteers immunized with a multivalent NoV VLP vaccine (genotypes GI.1/GII.4) were analyzed for IgG and Ab blockade of VLP interaction with carbohydrate ligand, a potential correlate of protective immunity to NoV infection and illness. Immunization resulted in rapid rises in IgG and blockade Ab titers against both vaccine components and additional VLPs representing diverse strains and genotypes not represented in the vaccine. Importantly, vaccination induced blockade Ab to two novel GII.4 strains not in circulation at the time of vaccination or sample collection. GII.4 cross-reactive blockade Ab titers were more potent than responses against non-GII.4 VLPs, suggesting that previous exposure history to this dominant circulating genotype may impact the vaccine Ab response. Further, antigenic cartography indicated that vaccination preferentially activated preexisting Ab responses to epitope sassociated with GII.4.1997. Study interpretations may be limited by the relevance of the surrogate neutralization assay and the number of immunized participants evaluated. Conclusions Vaccination with a multivalent NoV VLP vaccine induces a broadly blocking Ab response to multiple epitopes within vaccine and non-vaccine NoV strains and to novel antigenic variants not yet circulating at the time of vaccination. These data reveal new information about complex NoV immune responses to both natural exposure and to vaccination, and support the potential feasibility of an efficacious multivalent NoV VLP vaccine for future use in human populations.","[Lindesmith, Lisa C.; Debbink, Kari; Swanstrom, Jesica; Baric, Ralph S.] Univ N Carolina, Dept Epidemiol, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA; [Ferris, Martin T.; Mullan, Clancy W.] Univ N Carolina, Dept Genet, Chapel Hill, NC USA; [Ferreira, Jennifer] EMMES Corp, Rockville, MD USA; [Richardson, Charles; Goodwin, Robert R.; Mendelman, Paul M.; Bargatze, Robert F.] Takeda Vaccines, Deerfield, IL USA; [Baehner, Frank] Takeda Pharmaceut Int, Zurich, Switzerland","Lindesmith, LC (reprint author), Univ N Carolina, Dept Epidemiol, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA.",rbaric@email.unc.edu,,"Mullan, Clancy/0000-0002-2774-251X","National Institutes of Health, Allergy and Infectious Diseases [R01 AI056351, R56 A15-0756, U19 AI109761 CETR]","This work was supported by grants from the National Institutes of Health, Allergy and Infectious Diseases R01 AI056351, R56 A15-0756, and U19 AI109761 CETR.

Despite intense research efforts, drug resistance remains a major cause of treatment failure in CLL, particularly in patients with dysfunctional TP53. The objective of our work was to identify potential approaches that might overcome CLL drug refractoriness by examining the pro-apoptotic potential of targeting the cell surface receptor CD47 with serum-stable agonist peptides. Methods and Findings In peripheral blood samples collected from 80 patients with CLL with positive and adverse prognostic features, we performed in vitro genetic and molecular analyses that demonstrate that the targeting of CD47 with peptides derived from the C-terminal domain of thrombospondin-1 efficiently kills the malignant CLL B cells, including those from high-risk individuals with a dysfunctional TP53 gene, while sparing the normal T and B lymphocytes from the CLL patients. Further studies reveal that the differential response of normal B lymphocytes, collected from 20 healthy donors, and leukemic B cells to CD47 peptide targeting results from the sustained activation in CLL B cells of phospholipase C gamma-1 (PLC gamma 1), a protein that is significantly over-expressed in CLL. Once phosphorylated at tyrosine 783, PLC gamma 1 enables a Ca2+-mediated, caspase-independent programmed cell death (PCD) pathway that is not down-modulated by the lymphocyte microenvironment. Accordingly, down-regulation of PLC gamma 1 or pharmacological inhibition of PLC gamma 1 phosphorylation abolishes CD47-mediated killing. Additionally, in a CLL-xenograft model developed in NOD/scid gamma mice, we demonstrate that the injection of CD47 agonist peptides reduces tumor burden without inducing anemia or toxicity in blood, liver, or kidney. The limitations of our study are mainly linked to the affinity of the peptides targeting CD47, which might be improved to reach the standard requirements in drug development, and the lack of a CLL animal model that fully mimics the human disease. Conclusions Our work provides substantial progress in (i) the development of serum-stable CD47 agonist peptides that are highly effective at inducing PCD in CLL, (ii) the understanding of the molecular events regulating a novel PCD pathway that overcomes CLL apoptotic avoidance, (iii) the identification of PLC gamma 1 as an over-expressed protein in CLL B cells, and (iv) the description of a novel peptide-based strategy against CLL.","[Martinez-Torres, Ana-Carolina; Quiney, Claire; Herbi, Linda; Vela, Laura; Barbier, Sandrine; Chapiro, Elise; Florence Nguyen-Khac; Davi, Frederic; Le Garff-Tavernier, Magali; Merle-Beral, Helene; Susin, Santos A.] Ctr Rech Cordeliers, INSERM, Cell Death & Drug Resistance Lymphoproliferat Dis, UMRS1138, Paris, France; [Martinez-Torres, Ana-Carolina; Quiney, Claire; Herbi, Linda; Vela, Laura; Barbier, Sandrine; Chateau, Danielle; Chapiro, Elise; Florence Nguyen-Khac; Davi, Frederic; Le Garff-Tavernier, Magali; Merle-Beral, Helene; Susin, Santos A.] Univ Paris 06, Sorbonne Univ, Ctr Rech Cordeliers, UMRS1138, Paris, France; [Martinez-Torres, Ana-Carolina; Quiney, Claire; Herbi, Linda; Vela, Laura; Barbier, Sandrine; Chateau, Danielle; Susin, Santos A.] Univ Paris 05, Sorbonne Paris Cite, Ctr Rech Cordeliers, UMRS1138, Paris, France; [Attout, Tarik; Launay, Pierre] INSERM, U1149, Paris, France; [Attout, Tarik; Launay, Pierre] Univ Paris Diderot, Sorbonne Paris Cite, Site Xavier Bichat, Fac Med, Paris, France; [Boullet, Heloise; Moumne, Roba; Karoyan, Philippe] Univ Paris 06, Lab Biomol, UMR 7203, Paris, France; [Boullet, Heloise; Moumne, Roba; Karoyan, Philippe] Univ Paris 06, Sorbonne Univ, FR 2769, Paris, France; [Boullet, Heloise; Moumne, Roba; Karoyan, Philippe] CNRS, UMR 7203, Paris, France; [Boullet, Heloise; Moumne, Roba; Karoyan, Philippe] Ecole Normale Super, Dept Chim, F-75231 Paris, France; [Chateau, Danielle] Ctr Rech Cordeliers, Intestine Nutr Barrier & Dis Team, INSERM, U1138, Paris, France; [Chapiro, Elise; Florence Nguyen-Khac; Davi, Frederic; Le Garff-Tavernier, Magali; Merle-Beral, Helene] Grp Hosp Pitie Salpetriere, AP HP, Serv Hematol Biol, F-75634 Paris, France; [Sarfati, Marika] Ctr Rech Ctr Hosp Univ Montreal, Immunoregulat Lab, Montreal, PQ, Canada","Martinez-Torres, AC (reprint author), Ctr Rech Cordeliers, INSERM, Cell Death & Drug Resistance Lymphoproliferat Dis, UMRS1138, Paris, France.",santos.susin@crc.jussieu.fr,"Martinez-Torres, Ana Carolina/C-1845-2015; Susin, Santos/Q-6754-2017","Martinez-Torres, Ana Carolina/0000-0002-6183-0089; Susin, Santos/0000-0002-3366-1628; Nguyen-Khac, Florence/0000-0003-3107-6668",Association Laurette Fugain [ALF 2011/02]; Fondation de France-Comite Cancer [2012-00034116]; Ligue Contre le Cancer-Comite de Paris [RS15/75-63]; Inserm Transfert; French National Cancer Institute [INCa-5839]; French National Research Agency (ANR-Genopath "Target Channel") [ANR-12-EMMA-0045]; CONACYT (Mexico); Fondation ARC; Fondation pour la Recherche Medicale; French Research Ministry,"This work was supported by Association Laurette Fugain (ALF 2011/02), Fondation de France-Comite Cancer (2012-00034116), Ligue Contre le Cancer-Comite de Paris (RS15/75-63), Inserm Transfert, French National Cancer Institute (INCa-5839), and French National Research Agency (ANR-12-EMMA-0045; ANR-Genopath ""Target Channel"").

In 1971, the NIDR launched the National Caries Program (NCP). The objective of this paper is to explore the sugar industry's interaction with the NIDR to alter the research priorities of the NIDR NCP. Methods and Findings We used internal cane and beet sugar industry documents from 1959 to 1971 to analyze industry actions related to setting research priorities for the NCP. The sugar industry could not deny the role of sucrose in dental caries given the scientific evidence. They therefore adopted a strategy to deflect attention to public health interventions that would reduce the harms of sugar consumption rather than restricting intake. Industry tactics included the following: funding research in collaboration with allied food industries on enzymes to break up dental plaque and a vaccine against tooth decay with questionable potential for widespread application, cultivation of relationships with the NIDR leadership, consulting of members on an NIDR expert panel, and submission of a report to the NIDR that became the foundation of the first request for proposals issued for the NCP. Seventy-eight percent of the sugar industry submission was incorporated into the NIDR's call for research applications. Research that could have been harmful to sugar industry interests was omitted from priorities identified at the launch of the NCP. Limitations are that this analysis relies on one source of sugar industry documents and that we could not interview key actors. Conclusions The NCP was a missed opportunity to develop a scientific understanding of how to restrict sugar consumption to prevent tooth decay. A key factor was the alignment of research agendas between the NIDR and the sugar industry. This historical example illustrates how industry protects itself from potentially damaging research, which can inform policy makers today. Industry opposition to current policy proposals-including a World Health Organization guideline on sugars proposed in 2014 and changes to the nutrition facts panel on packaged food in the US proposed in 2014 by the US Food and Drug Administration-should be carefully scrutinized to ensure that industry interests do not supersede public health goals.","[Kearns, Cristin E.; Glantz, Stanton A.; Schmidt, Laura A.] Univ Calif San Francisco, Philip R Lee Inst Hlth Policy Studies, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; [Kearns, Cristin E.; Glantz, Stanton A.; Schmidt, Laura A.] Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Med, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; [Kearns, Cristin E.] Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Orofacial Sci, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; [Glantz, Stanton A.] Univ Calif San Francisco, Ctr Tobacco Control Res & Educ, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; [Glantz, Stanton A.] Univ Calif San Francisco, Helen Diller Family Comprehens Canc Ctr, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; [Schmidt, Laura A.] Univ Calif San Francisco, Clin & Translat Sci Inst, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; [Schmidt, Laura A.] Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Anthropol Hist & Social Med, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA","Kearns, CE (reprint author), Univ Calif San Francisco, Philip R Lee Inst Hlth Policy Studies, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA.",glantz@medicine.ucsf.edu,,,UCSF Philip R.

Development and implementation of a risk score model for CKD would allow comparison of the risks and benefits of adding potentially nephrotoxic antiretrovirals to a treatment regimen and would identify those at greatest risk of CKD. The aims of this study were to develop a simple, externally validated, and widely applicable long-term risk score model for CKD in HIV-positive individuals that can guide decision making in clinical practice. Methods and Findings A total of 17,954 HIV-positive individuals from the Data Collection on Adverse Events of Anti-HIV Drugs (D:A:D) study with >= 3 estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) values after 1 January 2004 were included. Baseline was defined as the first eGFR > 60 ml/min/1.73 m2 after 1 January 2004; individuals with exposure to tenofovir, atazanavir, atazanavir/ritonavir, lopinavir/ritonavir, other boosted protease inhibitors before baseline were excluded. CKD was defined as confirmed (>3 mo apart) eGFR <= 60 ml/min/1.73 m(2). Poisson regression was used to develop a risk score, externally validated on two independent cohorts. In the D:A:D study, 641 individuals developed CKD during 103,185 person-years of follow-up (PYFU; incidence 6.2/1,000 PYFU, 95% CI 5.7-6.7; median follow-up 6.1 y, range 0.3-9.1 y). Older age, intravenous drug use, hepatitis C coinfection, lower baseline eGFR, female gender, lower CD4 count nadir, hypertension, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease (CVD) predicted CKD. The adjusted incidence rate ratios of these nine categorical variables were scaled and summed to create the risk score. The median risk score at baseline was -2 (interquartile range -4 to 2). There was a 1: 393 chance of developing CKD in the next 5 y in the low risk group (risk score < 0, 33 events), rising to 1: 47 and 1: 6 in the medium (risk score 0-4, 103 events) and high risk groups (risk score >= 5, 505 events), respectively. Number needed to harm (NNTH) at 5 y when starting unboosted atazanavir or lopinavir/ritonavir among those with a low risk score was 1,702 (95% CI 1,166-3,367); NNTH was 202 (95% CI 159-278) and 21 (95% CI 19-23), respectively, for those with a medium and high risk score. NNTH was 739 (95% CI 506-1462), 88 (95% CI 69-121), and 9 (95% CI 8-10) for those with a low, medium, and high risk score, respectively, starting tenofovir, atazanavir/ritonavir, or another boosted protease inhibitor. The Royal Free Hospital Clinic Cohort included 2,548 individuals, of whom 94 individuals developed CKD (3.7%) during 18,376 PYFU (median follow-up 7.4 y, range 0.3-12.7 y). Of 2,013 individuals included from the SMART/ESPRIT control arms, 32 individuals developed CKD (1.6%) during 8,452 PYFU (median follow-up 4.1 y, range 0.6-8.1 y). External validation showed that the risk score predicted well in these cohorts. Limitations of this study included limited data on race and no information on proteinuria. Conclusions Both traditional and HIV-related risk factors were predictive of CKD. These factors were used to develop a risk score for CKD in HIV infection, externally validated, that has direct clinical relevance for patients and clinicians to weigh the benefits of certain antiretrovirals against the risk of CKD and to identify those at greatest risk of CKD.","[Mocroft, Amanda; Smith, Colette] UCL, Dept Infect & Populat Hlth, London, England; [Lundgren, Jens D.; Kirk, Ole; Ryom, Lene] Univ Copenhagen, Rigshosp, Copenhagen HIV Programme, Dept Infect Dis, DK-2100 Copenhagen, Denmark; [Ross, Michael] Mt Sinai Sch Med, Div Nephrol, New York, NY USA; [Law, Matthew] Univ New S Wales, Kirby Inst, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Reiss, Peter] Univ Amsterdam, Div Infect Dis, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Reiss, Peter] Univ Amsterdam, Acad Med Ctr, Dept Global Hlth, NL-1105 AZ Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Wentworth, Deborah; Neuhaus, Jacqueline] Univ Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN USA; [Fux, Christoph A.] Kantonsspital Aarau, Clin Infect Dis, Aarau, Switzerland; [Fux, Christoph A.] Kantonsspital Aarau, Hosp Hyg, Aarau, Switzerland; [Moranne, Olivier] Ctr Hosp Univ Nice, Dept Publ Hlth, Dept Nephrol, Nice, France; [Morlat, Phillipe] Ctr Hosp Univ Bordeaux, Univ Bordeaux, INSERM, U897, Bordeaux, France; [Johnson, Margaret A.] Royal Free London NHS Fdn Trust, Dept HIV Med, London, England","Mocroft, A (reprint author), UCL, Dept Infect & Populat Hlth, London, England.",a.mocroft@ucl.ac.uk,"Soriano, Vincent/O-5730-2018; Pulido, Federico/B-8417-2009; SHCS, int. coll.

Many schools are located in close proximity to busy roads, and traffic air pollution peaks when children are at school. We aimed to assess whether exposure of children in primary school to traffic-related air pollutants is associated with impaired cognitive development. Methods and Findings We conducted a prospective study of children (n = 2,715, aged 7 to 10 y) from 39 schools in Barcelona (Catalonia, Spain) exposed to high and low traffic-related air pollution, paired by school socioeconomic index; children were tested four times (i.e., to assess the 12-mo developmental trajectories) via computerized tests (n = 10,112). Chronic traffic air pollution (elemental carbon [EC], nitrogen dioxide [NO2], and ultrafine particle number [UFP; 10-700 nm]) was measured twice during 1-wk campaigns both in the courtyard (outdoor) and inside the classroom (indoor) simultaneously in each school pair. Cognitive development was assessed with the n-back and the attentional network tests, in particular, working memory (two-back detectability), superior working memory (three-back detectability), and inattentiveness (hit reaction time standard error). Linear mixed effects models were adjusted for age, sex, maternal education, socioeconomic status, and air pollution exposure at home. Children from highly polluted schools had a smaller growth in cognitive development than children from the paired lowly polluted schools, both in crude and adjusted models (e.g., 7.4% [95% CI 5.6%-8.8%] versus 11.5%[95% CI 8.9%-12.5%] improvement in working memory, p = 0.0024). Cogently, children attending schools with higher levels of EC, NO2, and UFP both indoors and outdoors experienced substantially smaller growth in all the cognitive measurements; for example, a change from the first to the fourth quartile in indoor EC reduced the gain in working memory by 13.0% (95% CI 4.2%-23.1%). Residual confounding for social class could not be discarded completely; however, the associations remained in stratified analyses (e.g., for type of school or high-/low-polluted area) and after additional adjustments (e.g., for commuting, educational quality, or smoking at home), contradicting a potential residual confounding explanation. Conclusions Children attending schools with higher traffic-related air pollution had a smaller improvement in cognitive development.","[Sunyer, Jordi; Esnaola, Mikel; Alvarez-Pedrerol, Mar; Forns, Joan; Rivas, Ioar; Lopez-Vicente, Monica; Suades-Gonzalez, Elisabet; Foraster, Maria; Garcia-Esteban, Raquel; Basagana, Xavier; Cirach, Marta; Nieuwenhuijsen, Mark] Ctr Res Environm Epidemiol CREAL, Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain; [Sunyer, Jordi; Esnaola, Mikel; Alvarez-Pedrerol, Mar; Forns, Joan; Rivas, Ioar; Lopez-Vicente, Monica; Suades-Gonzalez, Elisabet; Foraster, Maria; Garcia-Esteban, Raquel; Basagana, Xavier; Cirach, Marta; Sebastian-Galles, Nuria; Nieuwenhuijsen, Mark] Pompeu Fabra Univ, Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain; [Sunyer, Jordi; Esnaola, Mikel; Alvarez-Pedrerol, Mar; Forns, Joan; Rivas, Ioar; Lopez-Vicente, Monica; Suades-Gonzalez, Elisabet; Foraster, Maria; Garcia-Esteban, Raquel; Basagana, Xavier; Cirach, Marta; Nieuwenhuijsen, Mark] Consortium Biomed Res Epidemiol & Publ Hlth CIBER, Madrid, Spain; [Sunyer, Jordi] Inst Hosp del Mar Invest Med, Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain; [Rivas, Ioar; Viana, Mar; Moreno, Teresa; Alastuey, Andres; Querol, Xavier] CSIC, Inst Environm Assessment & Water Res IDAEA, Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain; [Suades-Gonzalez, Elisabet] Univ Barcelona, Hosp St Joan de Deu, Neuropediat Dept, Learning Disabil Unit UTAE, Barcelona, Spain","Sunyer, J (reprint author), Ctr Res Environm Epidemiol CREAL, Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain.",jsunyer@creal.cat,"Basagana, Xavier/C-3901-2017; Sebastian-Galles, Nuria/A-4215-2008; Alastuey, Andres/E-1706-2014; Querol, Xavier/E-2800-2014; Sunyer, Jordi/G-6909-2014; Rivas, Ioar/J-1505-2016; Nieuwenhuijsen, Mark/C-3914-2017; Moreno, Teresa/C-9349-2009","Basagana, Xavier/0000-0002-8457-1489; Sebastian-Galles, Nuria/0000-0001-6938-2498; Alastuey, Andres/0000-0002-5453-5495; Querol, Xavier/0000-0002-6549-9899; Sunyer, Jordi/0000-0002-2602-4110; Rivas, Ioar/0000-0002-4743-619X; Nieuwenhuijsen, Mark/0000-0001-9461-7981; Moreno, Teresa/0000-0003-3235-1027; Foraster, Maria/0000-0003-4450-4123",European Research Council under the ERC [268479],"The research leading to these results has received funding from the European Research Council under the ERC Grant Agreement number 268479 - the BREATHE project.

Involvement of industry organizations in policing promotion has been proposed to deter illicit conduct, but few detailed studies on self-regulation have been carried out to date. The objective of this study was to examine the evidence for promotion and self-regulation in the UK and Sweden, two countries frequently cited as examples of effective self-regulation. Methods and Findings We performed a qualitative content analysis of documents outlining the constitutions and procedures of these two systems. We also gathered data from self-regulatory bodies on complaints, complainants, and rulings for the period 2004-2012. The qualitative analysis revealed similarities and differences between the countries. For example, self-regulatory bodies in both countries are required to actively monitor promotional items and impose sanctions on violating companies, but the range of sanctions is greater in the UK where companies may, for instance, be audited or publicly reprimanded. In total, Swedish and UK bodies ruled that 536 and 597 cases, respectively, were in breach, equating to an average of more than one case/week for each country. In Sweden, 430 (47%) complaints resulted from active monitoring, compared with only two complaints (0.2%) in the UK. In both countries, a majority of violations concerned misleading promotion. Charges incurred on companies averaged (sic)447,000 and (sic)765,000 per year in Sweden and the UK, respectively, equivalent to about 0.014% and 0.0051% of annual sales revenues, respectively. One hundred cases in the UK (17% of total cases in breach) and 101 (19%) in Sweden were highlighted as particularly serious. A total of 46 companies were ruled in breach of code for a serious offence at least once in the two countries combined (n = 36 in the UK; n = 27 in Sweden); seven companies were in serious violation more than ten times each. A qualitative content analysis of serious violations pertaining to diabetes drugs (UK, n = 15; Sweden, n = 6; 10% of serious violations) and urologics (UK, n = 6; Sweden, n = 13; 9%) revealed various types of violations: misleading claims (n = 23; 58%); failure to comply with undertakings (n = 9; 23%); pre-licensing (n = 7; 18%) or off-label promotion (n = 2; 5%); and promotion of prescription drugs to the public (n = 6; 15%). Violations that go undetected or unpunished by self-regulatory bodies are the main limitation of this study, since they are likely to lead to an underestimate of industry misconduct. Conclusions The prevalence and severity of breaches testifies to a discrepancy between the ethical standard codified in industry Codes of Conduct and the actual conduct of the industry. We discuss regulatory reforms that may improve the quality of medicines information, such as prevetting and intensified active monitoring of promotion, along with larger fines, and giving greater publicity to rulings. But despite the importance of improving regulatory arrangements in an attempt to ensure unbiased medicines information, such efforts alone are insufficient because simply improving oversight and increasing penalties fail to address additional layers of industry bias.","[Zetterqvist, Anna V.] Lund Univ, Fac Med, Dept Clin Sci, Lund, Sweden; [Merlo, Juan; Mulinari, Shai] Lund Univ, Dept Clin Sci, Unit Social Epidemiol, Fac Med, Lund, Sweden; [Mulinari, Shai] Lund Univ, Fac Social Sci, Dept Sociol, Lund, Sweden","Zetterqvist, AV (reprint author), Lund Univ, Fac Med, Dept Clin Sci, Lund, Sweden.",shai.mulinari@soc.lu.se,"Merlo, Juan/E-2136-2011","Merlo, Juan/0000-0001-8379-9708; Mulinari, Shai/0000-0001-8773-9796",Swedish Research Council [2013-1268]; Riksbankens Jubileumsfond (Bank of Sweden Tercentenary Foundation) [P09-0281:1-E]; Stiftelsen Rektor Nils Stjernquists forskningsfond [RFv2013-0356],"Swedish Research Council, www.vr.se, nr. 2013-1268 (SM); Riksbankens Jubileumsfond (Bank of Sweden Tercentenary Foundation) www.rj.se, nr.

For example, haloperidol is a potent dopamine antagonist that is used to treat psychotic disorders, but 50% of treated patients develop characteristic extrapyramidal symptoms caused by haloperidol-induced toxicity (HIT), which limits its clinical utility. We do not have any information about the genetic factors affecting this drug-induced toxicity. HIT in humans is directly mirrored in a murine genetic model, where inbred mouse strains are differentially susceptible to HIT. Therefore, we genetically analyzed this murine model and performed a translational human genetic association study. Methods and Findings A whole genome SNP database and computational genetic mapping were used to analyze the murine genetic model of HIT. Guided by the mouse genetic analysis, we demonstrate that genetic variation within an ABC-drug efflux transporter (Abcb5) affected susceptibility to HIT. In situ hybridization results reveal that Abcb5 is expressed in brain capillaries, and by cerebellar Purkinje cells. We also analyzed chromosome substitution strains, imaged haloperidol abundance in brain tissue sections and directly measured haloperidol (and its metabolite) levels in brain, and characterized Abcb5 knockout mice. Our results demonstrate that Abcb5 is part of the blood-brain barrier; it affects susceptibility to HIT by altering the brain concentration of haloperidol. Moreover, a genetic association study in a haloperidol-treated human cohort indicates that human ABCB5 alleles had a time-dependent effect on susceptibility to individual and combined measures of HIT. Abcb5 alleles are pharmacogenetic factors that affect susceptibility to HIT, but it is likely that additional pharmacogenetic susceptibility factors will be discovered. Conclusions ABCB5 alleles alter susceptibility to HIT in mouse and humans. This discovery leads to a new model that (at least in part) explains inter-individual differences in susceptibility to a drug-induced CNS toxicity.","[Zheng, Ming; Zhang, Haili; Wu, Manhong; Peltz, Gary] Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Dept Anesthesia, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Dill, David L.; Tu, Susan] Stanford Univ, Comp Sci, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Clark, J.

Previous interventions have reported step-count increases, but not change in objectively measured MVPA in older people. We assessed whether a primary care nurse-delivered complex intervention increased objectively measured step-counts and MVPA. Methods and Findings A total of 988 60-75 year olds, able to increase walking and randomly selected from three UK family practices, were invited to participate in a parallel two-arm cluster randomised trial; randomisation was by household. Two-hundred-ninety-eight people from 250 households were randomised between 2011 and 2012; 150 individuals to the intervention group, 148 to the usual care control group. Intervention participants received four primary care nurse physical activity (PA) consultations over 3 months, incorporating behaviour change techniques, pedometer step-count and accelerometer PA intensity feedback, and an individual PA diary and plan. Assessors were not blinded to group status, but statistical analyses were conducted blind. The primary outcome was change in accelerometry assessed average daily step-counts between baseline and 3 months, with change at 12 months a secondary outcome. Other secondary outcomes were change from baseline in time in MVPA weekly in >= 10-minute bouts, accelerometer counts, and counts/minute at 3 months and 12 months. Other outcomes were adverse events, anthropometric measures, mood, and pain. Qualitative evaluations of intervention participants and practice nurses assessed the intervention's acceptability. At 3 months, eight participants had withdrawn or were lost to follow-up, 280 (94%) individuals provided primary outcome data. At 3 months changes in both average daily step-counts and weekly MVPA in >= 10-minute bouts were significantly higher in the intervention than control group: by 1,037 (95% CI 513-1,560) steps/day and 63 (95% CI 40-87) minutes/week, respectively. At 12 months corresponding differences were 609 (95% CI 104-1,115) steps/day and 40 (95% CI 17-63) minutes/week. Counts and counts/minute showed similar effects to steps and MVPA. Adverse events, anthropometry, mood, and pain were similar in the two groups. Participants and practice nurses found the intervention acceptable and enjoyable. Conclusions The PACE-Lift trial increased both step-counts and objectively measured MVPA in >= 10-minute bouts in 60-75 year olds at 3 and 12 months, with no effect on adverse events. To our knowledge, this is the first trial in this age group to demonstrate objective MVPA increases and highlights the value of individualised support incorporating objective PA assessment in a primary care setting.","[Harris, Tess; Whincup, Peter H.; Ussher, Michael; Limb, Elizabeth S.; Adams, Fredrika; Rogers, Annabelle; Cook, Derek G.] St Georges Univ London, Populat Hlth Res Inst, London, England; [Kerry, Sally M.] Queen Marys Univ London, Pragmat Clin Trials Unit, London, England; [Victor, Christina R.] Brunel Univ London, Coll Hlth & Life Sci, London, England; [Ekelund, Ulf] Norwegian Sch Sport Sci, Dept Sport Med, Oslo, Norway; [Ekelund, Ulf] Univ Cambridge, MRC Epidemiol Unit, Cambridge, England; [Woodcock, Alison] Independent Psychol Res Consultant, Southampton, Hants, England; [Iliffe, Steve] UCL, Res Dept Primary Care & Populat Hlth, London, England; [Beighton, Carole] Univ Kingston, Fac Hlth Social Care & Educ, London, England; [Beighton, Carole] St Georges Univ London, London, England; [David, Lee; Brewin, Debbie] 10 Minute CBT, Letchworth Garden City, Herts, England","Harris, T (reprint author), St Georges Univ London, Populat Hlth Res Inst, London, England.",tharris@sgul.ac.uk,"Iliffe, Steve/L-8379-2019; Cook, Derek/C-3271-2008; Beighton, Carole/F-3409-2016","Whincup, Peter/0000-0002-5589-4107; Ussher, Michael/0000-0002-0995-7955; Beighton, Carole/0000-0003-0625-1700; Harris, Tess/0000-0002-8671-1553; Victor, Christina/0000-0002-4213-3974","National Institute of Health Research (NIHR) [PB-PG-0909-20055]; Medical Research Council [MC_UU_12015/3, MC_U106179473]; National Institute for Health Research [PB-PG-0909-20055]","This paper presents independent research funded by the National Institute of Health Research (NIHR) under its Research for patient benefit programme (Grant reference number PB-PG-0909-20055).

Many studies of heterogeneity have had prespecified markers for tumor subpopulations, limiting their generalizability, or have involved massive efforts such as separate analysis of hundreds of individual cells, limiting their clinical use. We recently developed a general measure of intra-tumor genetic heterogeneity based on whole-exome sequencing (WES) of bulk tumor DNA, called mutant-allele tumor heterogeneity (MATH). Here, we examine data collected as part of a large, multi-institutional study to validate this measure and determine whether intra-tumor heterogeneity is itself related to mortality. Methods and Findings Clinical and WES data were obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas in October 2013 for 305 patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), from 14 institutions. Initial pathologic diagnoses were between 1992 and 2011 (median, 2008). Median time to death for 131 deceased patients was 14 mo; median follow-up of living patients was 22 mo. Tumor MATH values were calculated from WES results. Despite the multiple head and neck tumor subsites and the variety of treatments, we found in this retrospective analysis a substantial relation of high MATH values to decreased overall survival (Cox proportional hazards analysis: hazard ratio for high/low heterogeneity, 2.2; 95% CI 1.4 to 3.3). This relation of intra-tumor heterogeneity to survival was not due to intra-tumor heterogeneity's associations with other clinical or molecular characteristics, including age, human papillomavirus status, tumor grade and TP53 mutation, and N classification. MATH improved prognostication over that provided by traditional clinical and molecular characteristics, maintained a significant relation to survival in multivariate analyses, and distinguished outcomes among patients having oral-cavity or laryngeal cancers even when standard disease staging was taken into account. Prospective studies, however, will be required before MATH can be used prognostically in clinical trials or practice. Such studies will need to examine homogeneously treated HNSCC at specific head and neck subsites, and determine the influence of cancer therapy on MATH values. Analysis of MATH and outcome in human-papillomavirus-positive oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma is particularly needed. Conclusions To our knowledge this study is the first to combine data from hundreds of patients, treated at multiple institutions, to document a relation between intra-tumor heterogeneity and overall survival in any type of cancer. We suggest applying the simply calculated MATH metric of heterogeneity to prospective studies of HNSCC and other tumor types.","[Mroz, Edmund A.; Rocco, James W.] Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Ctr Canc Res, Boston, MA 02114 USA; [Mroz, Edmund A.; Rocco, James W.] Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Div Surg Oncol, Boston, MA 02114 USA; [Tward, Aaron M.; Hammon, Rebecca J.; Ren, Yin; Rocco, James W.] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Otol & Laryngol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Tward, Aaron M.; Hammon, Rebecca J.; Ren, Yin; Rocco, James W.] Massachusetts Eye & Ear Infirm, Boston, MA 02114 USA; [Tward, Aaron M.] Broad Inst MIT & Harvard, Cambridge, MA USA; [Rocco, James W.] Ohio State Univ, Dept Otolaryngol Head & Neck Surg, Columbus, OH 43210 USA","Mroz, EA (reprint author), Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Ctr Canc Res, Boston, MA 02114 USA.",James.Rocco@osumc.edu,,,National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research [R01 DE022087]; Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary Bacardi Biobank Fund,"Funding was provided by the National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research (http://www.nidcr.nih.gov/), grant R01 DE022087, and by private donations to the Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary Bacardi Biobank Fund, with JWR as Principal Investigator.

The objective of this study was to determine whether intra-tumour genetic heterogeneity resulting from clonal evolution and the emergence of subclonal tumour populations in HGSOC was associated with the development of resistant disease. Methods and Findings Evolutionary inference and phylogenetic quantification of heterogeneity was performed using the MEDICC algorithm on high-resolution whole genome copy number profiles and selected genome-wide sequencing of 135 spatially and temporally separated samples from 14 patients with HGSOC who received platinum-based chemotherapy. Samples were obtained from the clinical CTCR-OV03/04 studies, and patients were enrolled between 20 July 2007 and 22 October 2009. Median follow-up of the cohort was 31 mo (interquartile range 22-46 mo), censored after 26 October 2013. Outcome measures were overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS). There were marked differences in the degree of clonal expansion (CE) between patients (median 0.74, interquartile range 0.66-1.15), and dichotimization by median CE showed worse survival in CE-high cases (PFS 12.7 versus 10.1 mo, p = 0.009; OS 42.6 versus 23.5 mo, p = 0.003). Bootstrap analysis with resampling showed that the 95% confidence intervals for the hazard ratios for PFS and OS in the CE-high group were greater than 1.0. These data support a relationship between heterogeneity and survival but do not precisely determine its effect size. Relapsed tissue was available for two patients in the CE-high group, and phylogenetic analysis showed that the prevalent clonal population at clinical recurrence arose from early divergence events. A subclonal population marked by a NF1 deletion showed a progressive increase in tumour allele fraction during chemotherapy. Conclusions This study demonstrates that quantitative measures of intra-tumour heterogeneity may have predictive value for survival after chemotherapy treatment in HGSOC. Subclonal tumour populations are present in pre-treatment biopsies in HGSOC and can undergo expansion during chemotherapy, causing clinical relapse.","[Schwarz, Roland F.; Ng, Charlotte K.

We conducted an individual participant data (IPD) meta-analysis of studies from sub-Saharan Africa to compare the incidence of HIV infection in women using combined oral contraceptives (COCs) or the injectable progestins depot-medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA) or norethisterone enanthate (NETEN) with women not using HC. Methods and Findings Eligible studies measured HC exposure and incident HIV infection prospectively using standardized measures, enrolled women aged 15-49 y, recorded >= 15 incident HIV infections, and measured prespecified covariates. Our primary analysis estimated the adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) using two-stage random effects meta-analysis, controlling for region, marital status, age, number of sex partners, and condom use. We included 18 studies, including 37,124 women (43,613 woman-years) and 1,830 incident HIV infections. Relative to no HC use, the aHR for HIV acquisition was 1.50 (95% CI 1.24-1.83) for DMPA use, 1.24 (95% CI 0.84-1.82) for NET-EN use, and 1.03 (95% CI 0.88-1.20) for COC use. Between-study heterogeneity was mild (I-2 < 50%). DMPA use was associated with increased HIV acquisition compared with COC use (aHR 1.43, 95% CI 1.23-1.67) and NET-EN use (aHR 1.32, 95% CI 1.08-1.61). Effect estimates were attenuated for studies at lower risk of methodological bias (compared with no HC use, aHR for DMPA use 1.22, 95% CI 0.99-1.50; for NET-EN use 0.67, 95% CI 0.47-0.96; and for COC use 0.91, 95% CI 0.73-1.41) compared to those at higher risk of bias (p(interaction) = 0.003). Neither age nor herpes simplex virus type 2 infection status modified the HC-HIV relationship. Conclusions This IPD meta-analysis found no evidence that COC or NET-EN use increases women's risk of HIV but adds to the evidence that DMPA may increase HIV risk, underscoring the need for additional safe and effective contraceptive options for women at high HIV risk. A randomized controlled trial would provide more definitive evidence about the effects of hormonal contraception, particularly DMPA, on HIV risk.","[Morrison, Charles S.; Stalter, Randy] FHI 360, Clin Sci, Durham, NC 27701 USA; [Chen, Pai-Lien; Kwok, Cynthia] FHI 360, Biostat, Durham, NC USA; [Baeten, Jared M.; Heffron, Renee; McClelland, R.

Routine endoscopic screening for BE is not recommended because of the burden this would impose on the health care system. The objective of this study was to determine whether a novel approach using a minimally invasive cell sampling device, the Cytosponge, coupled with immunohistochemical staining for the biomarker Trefoil Factor 3 (TFF3), could be used to identify patients who warrant endoscopy to diagnose BE. Methods and Findings A case-control study was performed across 11 UK hospitals between July 2011 and December 2013. In total, 1,110 individuals comprising 463 controls with dyspepsia and reflux symptoms and 647 BE cases swallowed a Cytosponge prior to endoscopy. The primary outcome measures were to evaluate the safety, acceptability, and accuracy of the Cytosponge-TFF3 test compared with endoscopy and biopsy. In all, 1,042 (93.9%) patients successfully swallowed the Cytosponge, and no serious adverse events were attributed to the device. The Cytosponge was rated favorably, using a visual analogue scale, compared with endoscopy (p < 0.001), and patients who were not sedated for endoscopy were more likely to rate the Cytosponge higher than endoscopy (Mann-Whitney test, p < 0.001). The overall sensitivity of the test was 79.9%(95% CI 76.4%-83.0%), increasing to 87.2% (95% CI 83.0%-90.6%) for patients with >= 3 cm of circumferential BE, known to confer a higher cancer risk. The sensitivity increased to 89.7% (95% CI 82.3%-94.8%) in 107 patients who swallowed the device twice during the study course. There was no loss of sensitivity in patients with dysplasia. The specificity for diagnosing BE was 92.4% (95% CI 89.5%-94.7%). The case-control design of the study means that the results are not generalizable to a primary care population. Another limitation is that the acceptability data were limited to a single measure. Conclusions The Cytosponge-TFF3 test is safe and acceptable, and has accuracy comparable to other screening tests. This test may be a simple and inexpensive approach to identify patients with reflux symptoms who warrant endoscopy to diagnose BE.","[Ross-Innes, Caryn S.; Debiram-Beecham, Irene; Walker, Elaine; Varghese, Sibu; Lao-Sirieix, Pierre; Fitzgerald, Rebecca C.] Univ Cambridge, MRC Canc Unit, Hutchison MRC Res Ctr, Cambridge, England; [O'Donovan, Maria] Addenbrookes Hosp, Dept Histopathol, Cambridge CB2 2QQ, England; [Lovat, Laurence; Haidry, Rehan; Novelli, Marco] Univ Coll London Hosp, London, England; [Griffin, Michael; Disep, Babett] Royal Victoria Infirm, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 4LP, Tyne & Wear, England; [Ragunath, Krish; Sami, Sarmed S.; Kaye, Philip] Nottingham Queens Med Ctr, Nottingham, England; [Ostler, Richard; Aigret, Benoit; North, Bernard V.; Sasieni, Peter D.] Canc Prevent Trials Unit, London, England; [Bhandari, Pradeep] Queen Alexandra Hosp, Portsmouth, Hants, England; [Haycock, Adam] St Marks Hosp, London EC1V 2PS, England; [Morris, Danielle] East & North Hertfordshire NHS Trust, QEII Hosp, Welwyn Garden City, Herts, England; [Morris, Danielle] Lister Hosp, Welwyn Garden City, Herts, England; [Morris, Danielle] East & North Hertfordshire NHS Trust, QEII Hosp, Stevenage, Herts, England; [Morris, Danielle] Lister Hosp, Stevenage, Herts, England; [Attwood, Stephen; Dhar, Anjan; Rees, Colin; Rutter, Matthew D.

We conducted a stepped-wedge, community-level randomized trial to determine whether a public health intervention promoting EPT could increase its use and decrease chlamydia test positivity and gonorrhea incidence in women. Methods and Findings The trial randomly assigned local health jurisdictions (LHJs) in Washington State, US, into four study waves. Waves instituted the intervention in randomly assigned order at intervals of 6-8 mo. Of the state's 25 LHJs, 24 were eligible and 23 participated. Heterosexual individuals with gonorrhea or chlamydial infection were eligible for the intervention. The study made free patient-delivered partner therapy (PDPT) available to clinicians, and provided public health partner services based on clinician referral. The main study outcomes were chlamydia test positivity among women ages 14-25 y in 219 sentinel clinics, and incidence of reported gonorrhea in women, both measured at the community level. Receipt of PDPT from clinicians was evaluated among randomly selected patients. 23 and 22 LHJs provided data on gonorrhea and chlamydia outcomes, respectively. The intervention increased the percentage of persons receiving PDPT from clinicians (from 18% to 34%, p < 0.001) and the percentage receiving partner services (from 25% to 45%, p < 0.001). Chlamydia test positivity and gonorrhea incidence in women decreased over the study period, from 8.2% to 6.5% and from 59.6 to 26.4 per 100,000, respectively. After adjusting for temporal trends, the intervention was associated with an approximately 10% reduction in both chlamydia positivity and gonorrhea incidence, though the confidence bounds on these outcomes both crossed one (chlamydia positivity prevalence ratio = 0.89, 95% CI 0.77-1.04, p = 0.15; gonorrhea incidence rate ratio = 0.91, 95% CI.71-1.16, p = 0.45). Study findings were potentially limited by inadequate statistical power, by the institution of some aspects of the study intervention outside of the research randomization sequence, and by the fact that LHJs did not constitute truly isolated sexual networks. Conclusions A public health intervention promoting the use of free PDPT substantially increased its use and may have resulted in decreased chlamydial and gonococcal infections at the population level.","[Golden, Matthew R.; Kerani, Roxanne P.; Hughes, James P.; Malinski, Cheryl; Holmes, King K.] Univ Washington, Ctr AIDS & STD, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Golden, Matthew R.; Holmes, King K.] Univ Washington, Dept Med, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Golden, Matthew R.; Kerani, Roxanne P.] Publ Hlth Seattle & King Cty, Seattle, WA USA; [Stenger, Mark; Aubin, Mark] Washington State Dept Hlth, Olympia, WA USA; [Hughes, James P.] Univ Washington, Dept Biostat, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Holmes, King K.] Univ Washington, Dept Global Hlth, Seattle, WA 98195 USA","Golden, MR (reprint author), Univ Washington, Ctr AIDS & STD, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.",golden@uw.edu,", Holmes/K-6215-2019",,National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases [R01AI068107]; Pfizer Pharmaceuticals,"MRG, RPK, JPH, and KKH received funding from National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (R01AI068107, http://www.niaid.nih.gov).

We evaluated whether variations in RSV epidemic timing and magnitude are associated with variations in pneumococcal disease epidemics and whether changes in pneumococcal disease following the introduction of seven-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV7) were associated with changes in the rate of hospitalizations coded as RSV. Methods and Findings: We used data from the State Inpatient Databases (Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality), including >700,000 RSV hospitalizations and > 16,000 pneumococcal pneumonia hospitalizations in 36 states (1992/1993-2008/2009). Harmonic regression was used to estimate the timing of the average seasonal peak of RSV, pneumococcal pneumonia, and pneumococcal septicemia. We then estimated the association between the incidence of pneumococcal disease in children and the activity of RSV and influenza (where there is a well-established association) using Poisson regression models that controlled for shared seasonal variations. Finally, we estimated changes in the rate of hospitalizations coded as RSV following the introduction of PCV7. RSV and pneumococcal pneumonia shared a distinctive spatiotemporal pattern (correlation of peak timing: p = 0.70, 95% CI: 0.45, 0.84). RSV was associated with a significant increase in the incidence of pneumococcal pneumonia in children aged <1 y (attributable percent [AP]: 20.3%, 95% CI: 17.4%, 25.1%) and among children aged 1-2 y (AP: 10.1%, 95% CI: 7.6%, 13.9%). Influenza was also associated with an increase in pneumococcal pneumonia among children aged 1-2 y (AP: 3.2%, 95% CI: 1.7%, 4.7%). Finally, we observed a significant decline in RSV-coded hospitalizations in children aged,1 y following PCV7 introduction (-18.0%, 95% CI: -22.6%, -13.1%, for 2004/2005-2008/2009 versus 1997/1998-1999/2000). This study used aggregated hospitalization data, and studies with individual-level, laboratory-confirmed data could help to confirm these findings. Conclusions: These analyses provide evidence for an interaction between RSV and pneumococcal pneumonia. Future work should evaluate whether treatment for secondary bacterial infections could be considered for pneumonia cases even if a child tests positive for RSV.
